# Solve a Money Problem Fast

Rated 5/5 Stars

This is a spell meant to help you when you need a sum of money desperately and you need it as quickly as possible

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

+   1 black candle ( taper or chime )

+   A candle holder

+   Heliotrope oil

+   Dragon's blood incense

+   A pin

## Casting Instructions for 'Solve a Money Problem Fast'

Light the Dragon's Blood incense and place the censer on your altar. Using the pin inscribe the black candle with these words: " money " and " wealth " or you could use other words that attract money ( you can even use the Theban Alphabet to inscribe the words on the candle if you want ... it works better ). While doing this concentrate on what you want to achieve with this spell ... put your intention in it .

Once the candle is inscribed take the heliotrope oil and anoint the candle by rubbing the oil on it and while doing this think again at the problem you have and imagine your energy going into the candle. Now place the candle on a holder on your altar and get on your knees and invoke the Goddess to come to your aid by saying: ( you can cast your circle for protection if you want )

" Maiden, Mother, Crone

Gaining, waxing, waining,

Crescent, Full and Dark

Sacred Dance, Sacred Chants ,

Journey and Dream,

cast down your love

upon my sacred time

I call to you growing, growing

Gainning, waxing, knowing "

When you have finished concentrate and speak the following:

" Goddess I'm desperate.

Hear my plea !

Humbly and Hopefully

I ask of thee

To solve my money problems

And to help me !

Please send me what I need"

After this ask the Goddess in your own words what exactly you need money for and begg her again to help you . To make sure that there are no side effects to this spell say:

" By The Power of Three times Three

In no way shall this spell backfire for me

Or have another effect than what I want it to be !

This is my will so mote it be ! "

Hold the burning candle in your hands for another minute and after that place it on a holder on your altar . Thank the Goddess with this formula:

" Blessed Be my Great Goddess

The ritual is done, the magick has been cast

Within my heart you remain

Abundant of energy you sustain

Depart with love,

Merry meet, merry part, merry meet again !

So mote it be ! "

Let the candle burn for a couple of minutes and then extinguish it with your fingers or a candle snuffer but DON'T BLOW ON IT because that would be bad.
