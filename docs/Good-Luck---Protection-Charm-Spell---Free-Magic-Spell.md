There you go! now you have a good luck charm. Please let me know how it worked for you guys. I have done it a couple of times now and it has worked very well every time. Though when you do notice the luck not working so much any more I would recommend doing the spell again. Mine typically last for a couple of months. This spell works for you and your friends. It'll work on any object for anyone!! Thank you and once again I would love feedback!!!
