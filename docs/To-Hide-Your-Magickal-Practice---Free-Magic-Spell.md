# To Hide Your Magickal Practice

A simple spell to ensure that no one figures out about your magickal practice. This won't make you invisible but can make sure they don't walk in on important rituals. It'll make sure they don't find your book of shadows and altar, along with any other magickal items, but it won't make them invisible. The spell will also help them believe believable lies you tell them if they do somehow find some magickal item or book like tarots or something else.

## Casting Instructions for 'To Hide Your Magickal Practice'

**你将需要以下物品来施展这个咒语：**

Nothing

**你将需要以下物品来施展这个咒语：**

Nothing

1\. Go inside the room where you keep your altar and magickal items. If you don't have anything like that, simply go to the room where most of your magick is done. Cast a circle and say 3 times:-

"Secrets, I now contain, within this room you shall remain

Whether it be day or night, whether it be fight or flight, never enter the light

Stay in the darkness, stick to the shadows

Oh mighty, Secrets unhallowed"

2\. While speaking, imagine a force field coming up in every entrance of the room
