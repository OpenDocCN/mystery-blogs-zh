- en: For hundreds of years between the 1400s and 1700s, a craze gripped Europe. Thousands
    of people were accused of practicing magic, and were executed. What could have
    caused so many people to go into a fearful hysteria of witches and their crafts?
    Why would innocent people be targeted in such a way. The history of witches and
    the resultant fear is an interesting and surprising one.

  zh: 在15世纪至17世纪间的几百年里，欧洲陷入了疯狂的状态。数千人被指控使用魔法，并被处死。是什么导致了如此多的人陷入对女巫及其手艺的恐惧的狂热状态？为什么无辜的人会以这种方式成为目标。女巫的历史以及由此产生的恐惧是一个有趣而令人惊讶的故事。
- en: Throughout human history, the idea of witches and magic surfaces again and again.
    In modern times, this concept of witches is used in fairy tales and fantasy literature,
    but in Europe hundreds of years ago, witches were believed to be a heretical threat
    to society. As a result of this belief, about one hundred thousand people were
    accused of witchcraft, forty or fifty thousand of whom were executed, between
    the years of 1482 and 1782.[fsbProduct asin=’B01GAIV342′ size=’300′ align=’right’]

  zh: 在人类历史上，关于女巫和魔法的概念一再浮出水面。在现代，女巫的这种概念被用于童话故事和奇幻文学，但几百年前的欧洲，女巫被认为是对社会的异端威胁。由于这种信仰，在1482年至1782年间，约有十万人被指控为女巫，其中四五万人被处死。[fsbProduct

- en: While men could be accused of witchcraft; about 20-30 percent of accused witches
    were male; most witches were female. In some areas, this ratio changed. For example,
    in Moscow, more than twice as many men were accused of witchcraft than women.
    In Normandy, the ratio was three times as many men accused as women.

  zh: 尽管男性也可能被指控为女巫；约20-30％的被指控的女巫是男性；大多数女巫是女性。在一些地区，这个比例发生了变化。例如，在莫斯科，被指控为女巫的男性是女性的两倍以上。在诺曼底，被指控的男性是女性的三倍。
- en: However, in most of Europe, women were considered to be much more likely suspects
    for witchcraft. It was believed at the time that, because of the fable of Eve,
    women were weaker spiritually than men. Because of this spiritual weakness, it
    was said, women were more open to being seduced by satanic influences and give
    themselves over to witchcraft.

  zh: 然而，在大多数欧洲地区，女性被认为更有可能被指控为女巫。当时人们相信，由于夏娃的寓言，女性在精神上比男性更虚弱。因为这种精神上的脆弱，据说女性更容易被撒旦的影响所诱导，并投身于女巫的行为。
- en: Accused witches were also typically poor and elderly; the image of the fantasy
    old crone in her tattered robes is not far off the true appearance of many supposed
    witches. Old widows were disproportionately represented among the accused.

  zh: 被指控的女巫通常也是贫穷和年老的人；那些身穿破旧长袍的幻想老女巫的形象与许多所谓女巫的真实外貌并不远。被指控的老寡妇在被指控的人中所占比例偏高。
- en: Being accused of witchcraft for a woman was terrifying, because there is no
    good way to prove a negative, especially in the eyes of a frenzied and paranoid
    culture afraid of the other. Women and men not properly integrated into the local
    culture would quickly have stories invented about them, and these stories would
    grow into dark tales of rituals, magic, and the occult.

  zh: 对于一名女性被指控为女巫是一种可怕的经历，因为没有好的方法来证明一个否定，尤其是在一个对异己充满恐惧和偏执的文化眼中。未能妥善融入当地文化的女性和男性很快就会有关于他们的故事被编造出来，而这些故事会演变成关于仪式、魔法和神秘主义的黑暗传说。
- en: The history of witches, then, is really the history of outcasts who had their
    society turn on them. An old widow who prefers to keep to herself with her cat
    turns into a sorceress with her familiar, working dark magic to cause a sickness
    that kills a child. A quiet man who lives in a hut outside of town hunting food
    becomes an occultist performing sacrificial blood rituals to cause a bad harvest.

  zh: 女巫的历史实际上就是社会转向他们的被拒绝者的历史。一个喜欢与猫为伴的老寡妇变成了她的伴侣的女巫，用黑暗魔法引起了一场导致孩子死亡的疾病。一个住在城镇外独居并捕食的安静男子成为了一个进行牺牲性血腥仪式以导致糟糕收成的秘术者。
- en: All told, fanaticism and panic killed around fifty thousand people in the years
    between 1482 and 1782 in Europe. Today, of course, witches and magic are perceived,
    in civilized circles, completely differently then back in those days. However,
    the idea of the cruel old woman brewing potions and turning people into toads
    remains in the public consciousness in the form of our stories, passed down from
    when they were believed to be quite real.

  zh: 总的来说，狂热和恐慌在1482年至1782年间在欧洲夺去了大约五万人的生命。当然，今天在文明圈子里，女巫和魔法的观念完全不同于当时。然而，那个残忍的老妇人煮药水并把人变成蟾蜍的想法在我们的故事中仍然存在于公众意识中，传承自那些被认为是真实的时代。
- en: Hopefully, the history of witches will change as the years pass and we will
    begin to realize that although a religion, or belief system, is not a reason for
    persecution.  While we see many other examples of this across the world today,
    and in some places there are still people persecuting people for witchcraft, we
    can only work together to create an understanding of one another with the hope
    that one day, the stupidity of this type of persecution will be stamped out. Until
    that day does arrive though, we all need to keep an eye on the evolution of the
    **history of witches.**

  zh: 希望随着岁月的推移，女巫的历史会发生改变，我们将开始意识到，宗教或信仰体系并不是迫害的理由。虽然我们今天在世界各地看到许多其他类似的例子，在一些地方仍然有人因为巫术而迫害他人，但我们只能共同努力，希望能够相互理解，期待有一天，这种迫害的愚蠢将被消灭。然而，在那一天到来之前，我们都需要关注**女巫的历史**的发展。
