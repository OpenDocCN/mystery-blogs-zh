- en: According to a study done in 2017 by Pew Research, folk religions and religions
    classified as ‘other’ make up approximately 6.5% of the world’s religious affiliation
    (1). That is only about 474.5 million people out of 7 billion. I know those are
    large numbers to visualize, but these numbers are important when thinking about
    dating and relationships with others.

  zh: 根据2017年皮尤研究中进行的一项研究，民间宗教和分类为“其他”的宗教约占世界宗教信仰的6.5%（1）。这仅占70亿人口中的约4.745亿人。我知道这些数字很难想象，但在考虑约会和与他人的关系时，这些数字非常重要。
- en: We make up only a small portion of the world’s religions, so it makes sense
    that most of us might end up in relationships with a partner - or partners - that
    do not follow our religious path. I am one of those people, so I am speaking from
    experience on this topic. My boyfriend and I have been together since 2008 and
    he does not have a religious affiliation. He describes his beliefs as agnostic,
    which means he does not believe in a higher power but he also does not deny the
    possibility of it.

  zh: 我们只占世界宗教的一小部分，因此大多数人可能最终会与不遵循我们宗教道路的伴侣 - 或伴侣们 - 结为情侣。我就是其中之一，所以我在这个话题上是有经验的。我和男朋友自2008年以来一直在一起，他没有宗教信仰。他描述自己的信仰为不可知论者，意味着他不相信有更高的力量，但也不否认这种可能性。
- en: There are plenty of times when we do get into healthy discussions about my beliefs
    and how I understand the world. We have talked about my views on the afterlife,
    magick, energy work, and the Gods. It is never a discussion of right versus wrong,
    only a discussion for further understanding. We are far from perfect, however.
    We still have our differences when it comes to teaching our daughter and how to
    answer her questions.

  zh: 有很多时候我们都会进行有益的讨论，关于我的信仰以及我如何理解世界。我们已经谈论过我对来世、魔法、能量工作和众神的看法。这从来不是对错的讨论，只是为了更深入地理解而进行的讨论。然而，我们离完美还有很远。在教育我们的女儿和如何回答她的问题时，我们仍然存在分歧。

  zh: 需要考虑的事项
- en: When dating non-pagans, several things need to be considered when looking at
    long-term goals. Do you plan on getting married? Having children? How do your
    families get along? All of these questions, plus those that I could not possibly
    list as they come up, will have some sort of impact on your relationship in regards
    to religion. If you plan on getting married, will you have a religious ceremony
    or a secular one? If you have kids, will you raise them in your religion? Theirs?
    Neither?

  zh: 在与非异教徒约会时，需要考虑几个问题，尤其是在考虑长期目标时。你打算结婚吗？要孩子吗？你们的家庭关系如何？所有这些问题，以及我不可能列出的那些问题，都会在宗教方面对你们的关系产生某种影响。如果你打算结婚，你会举行宗教仪式还是世俗仪式？如果有孩子，你会让他们信仰你的宗教吗？还是对方的宗教？还是都不信仰？
- en: It is important to be open-minded and honest with your partner(s) about your
    religious beliefs from the beginning. This does not mean that you need to talk
    about religion on the first date but keep in mind that some people have irreconcilable
    differences with those that do not hold the same religious beliefs.

  zh: 从一开始就对伴侣们坦诚开放地谈论你的宗教信仰很重要。这并不意味着你需要在第一次约会时就谈论宗教，但请记住，有些人对不持有相同宗教信仰的人有不可调和的分歧。

- en: People of different religious affiliations can have long and happy relationships,
    but several key things have to be true for that to happen. All partners have to
    be open-minded. All partners have to be honest with each other. Judgment cannot
    hold a place in their relationship. Communication is the biggest concern when
    in a relationship with someone who does not hold the same beliefs as you. This
    goes both ways, no matter the religion. Even though you are a pagan, you cannot
    hold judgment or resentment against your partner(s) for their differing beliefs.
    It is a two-way street, and all parties involved need to have open communication
    and honesty.

  zh: 不同宗教信仰的人可以拥有长久而幸福的关系，但这需要几个关键条件得到满足。所有的伴侣都必须心胸开阔。所有的伴侣都必须彼此诚实。在他们的关系中不能有评判。当与信仰不同的人建立关系时，沟通是最大的关注点。这对双方来说都如此，无论信仰何种宗教。即使你是异教徒，你也不能因为伴侣有不同的信仰而带有评判或怨恨。这是双向的，所有涉及的各方都需要开放的沟通和诚实。
