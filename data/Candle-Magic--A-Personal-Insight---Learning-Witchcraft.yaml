    cake, or perhaps watching another person blow out their own candles? Perhaps you
    have seen vigil candles lit in honor or remembrance of a person or event. These
    are both very common practices and are considered sympathetic magic. The idea
    of candle magic is that when you light your candle, you are setting your intent
    or goal on fire. The lit flame of the candle symbolizes the flame or spark of
    the intention you are setting, whether the intention is to manifest something

    be a great substitute for artificial lighting during spells or rituals. For this

    **candle magic**. The thing I like most about magic of candles is that it is simple
    and practical. There are a variety of shapes and sizes of candles to choose from.
    One of my very first experiences with the magic of candles was using birthday
    candles. As a teenager, money for things like candles was hard to come by and
    we always had a pack of birthday candles in the junk drawer so I would use them
    for various spells.

- en: 'My process generally (although not always) begins with me inscribing my candle
    with symbols or words to correspond with my intent and anointing the candle with
    an oil as I hold the candle between my palms and move my hands back and forth
    so that the candle twists back and forth. Palming my candles is a technique that
    I always do so that I can add my own personal energy to the candle. As I do this,
    I am both visualizing my intent manifesting and speaking my intention, whether
    out loud or to myself. As my visualization gets stronger, so does the energy I
    am raising. I generally have one rule when it comes to candle magic: use what
    is available. I have found that even though the color of the candle will help
    to boost the energy, the real power comes from the energy behind my intent. The
    candle itself is merely just a tool or vessel in which my energy flows through.
    When available, I like to use red for passion, justice, love and lust/sex; green
    for prosperity, money and abundance; purple for protection, balancing emotions
    and self healing; and yellow or blue for healing. I often use black candles as
    a filter for negative energy and white candles to banish negativity or as a substitute
    for other colors. How strong the flame of the candle is and whether or not it
    goes out on its own can be an indicator of how strong my spell is and what the
    end result may be. The length of time it takes for the candle to burn down can
    be an indicator of how long it will take my intent to manifest. I often use the
    wax flow and flame of the candle as a means of divination by interpreting symbols
    and shapes that may form as the wax melts and as the flame flickers. I also find
    it useful to meditate by focusing on the flame. This practice is mostly done at
    night so that I can focus entirely on the flame and the feelings or messages that
    come to me during the meditation.'

  zh: 我的过程通常（虽然不总是）从我用符号或词语在我的蜡烛上刻上对应我的意图开始，然后我会用一种油膏膏我的蜡烛，当我把蜡烛放在手掌之间并来回移动我的手时，使蜡烛来回扭动。握蜡烛是我总是做的一个技巧，这样我就可以把自己的个人能量加到蜡烛上。当我这样做时，我既在想象我的意图显现，也在说出我的意图，无论是大声说还是对自己说。随着我的想象力变得更加强大，我所提升的能量也越强。当涉及到蜡烛魔法时，我一般有一个规则：使用现有的资源。我发现，即使蜡烛的颜色会帮助提升能量，真正的力量却来自于我意图背后的能量。蜡烛本身只是我能量流动的工具或容器。在可用时，我喜欢使用红色代表激情、正义、爱情和欲望/性；绿色代表繁荣、金钱和丰富；紫色代表保护、平衡情绪和自我疗愈；黄色或蓝色代表治疗。我经常使用黑色蜡烛来过滤负面能量，白色蜡烛来驱散消极情绪或代替其他颜色。蜡烛的火焰强度以及它是否自己熄灭可以表明我的咒语有多强大以及最终结果可能是什么。蜡烛燃烧到底需要多长时间可以表明我的意图需要多久才能显现。我经常利用蜡流和蜡烛的火焰作为占卜的手段，通过解释蜡烛融化时可能形成的符号和形状以及火焰闪烁的方式。我还发现，通过专注火焰来冥想是有用的。这种做法主要是在晚上进行的，这样我就可以完全专注于火焰和冥想期间给我的感受或信息。
- en: The way you use your candle can be symbolic of the type of work or spell you
    are doing. Burning a candle on top of a mirror can aid in self-reflection but
    it can also repel negative energies and influences. Fire is both purifying and
    destructive so if you want to banish something or bring cleansing or even destruction
    to a situation, write the situation and your intention on a piece of paper and
    burn it in the flame. Placing thumb tacks or push pins into the candle can be
    useful when doing spells to bring justice when righting wrongs or to punish or
    incite revenge on another. The idea here is that the candle can represent the
    person/people in the situation or the candle represents the situation and the
    push pins are your way of “stickin’ it to them”. Once the candle has burned down,
    I like to save the wax drippings to combine them with other wax drippings of the
    same intent. For instance, if I have an abundance of candles used in healing work,
    I will combine all of the wax from those particular workings to make a new candle
    or to use in folk bags or folk dolls. To send something away, the wax drippings
    can be buried or discarded somewhere away from you, such as near a train track
    to “carry” it away. To bring something towards you, the drippings can be buried
    close to you or left at the train track to “deliver” something to you. Often times,
    lighting a candle can simply be a means of purifying an object or item by passing
    it through the flame.

  zh: 你使用蜡烛的方式可以象征你正在进行的工作或咒语的类型。在镜子上燃烧蜡烛可以帮助自我反思，但也可以驱散负面能量和影响。火既有净化作用也有破坏性，所以如果你想要驱除某物或者为某种情况带来清洁甚至破坏，可以在一张纸上写下情况和你的意图，然后在火焰中烧掉它。在进行法术时，将图钉或别针插入蜡烛中是有用的，比如在纠正错误时带来正义或惩罚或者激发对另一个人的报复。这里的思想是蜡烛可以代表情况中的人或人群，或者蜡烛代表情况本身，而图钉则是你“钉住他们”的方式。蜡烛燃尽后，我喜欢保留滴下的蜡与其他具有相同意图的蜡结合在一起。例如，如果我有很多用于治愈工作的蜡烛，我会将这些特定工作的所有蜡结合起来制作成一个新的蜡烛，或者用于民间袋子或民间玩偶。要把某物送走，可以将蜡滴埋在远离你的地方，比如靠近铁轨的地方，以便“带走”它。要吸引某物，可以将蜡滴埋在靠近你的地方或者留在铁轨上，“传递”某物给你。经常点燃蜡烛只是通过火焰使物体或物品净化的一种手段。

    deities or events. My daily ritual consists of lighting a candle for the deities
    and spirits that watch over my family and home.I have special candles that I light
    during my menstrual cycle and when I am working with certain deities. My candles
    serve as more than just magical tools or vessels. They also serve as focal points
    or reminders for whatever work I am doing at that particular moment. By keeping
    certain candles out on my altars, I am reminded to light them and send my vibrations
    of intent out into the universe. In circumstances of death, such as when a loved
    one passes away, I will often light a candle so that the flame will help them
    find their way to the afterlife, or if a loved one feels lost or hopeless, I will
    light a candle to help them find their way back.
