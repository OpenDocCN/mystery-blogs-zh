- en: The story of Airmed is as enchanting as it is enlightening. According to legend,
    she was one of the fabled race of god-like beings, known as the Tuatha Dé Danann,
    who once graced the Irish landscapes. Airmed's father, Dian Cecht, was the tribe's
    healer and, together with her brother Miach, they practiced the art of healing
    like no others.

- en: Tragically, in an outburst of envy over Miach's superior skills, Dian Cecht
    slew his own son. And from Miach's grave, an incredible array of herbs sprang
    forth, each one collectively expressing all of the secrets of herbalism. Airmed,
    in her grief, collected and cataloged these herbs, learning about their virtues
    and, ultimately, the blessings that they could bestow upon humanity. However,
    her father, in a second fit of rage and envy, scattered the herbs, obscuring their
    knowledge forever.
