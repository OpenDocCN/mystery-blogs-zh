  zh: 瓦伦泰因节还是卢佩卡利亚节？
- en: 'Valentine’s Day is always one of those days that conjures up one of two sentiments:
    either you’re excited and heading out to get your beloved one a card and a gift,
    or phoning all the hottest restaurants in town trying to book a table for you
    and your partner or love interest. Maybe you’re rushing out to get a bottle of
    champagne for a romantic night in, and checking your pennies to see if you can
    afford that expensive restaurant meal. On the flip side of that, maybe you’re
    one of those people who thinks that Valentine’s Day was created by corporations
    to fill the gap in marketing between Christmas and Easter. Well let me tell you
    – it wasn’t!'

  zh: 瓦伦泰因节总是一个会唤起两种情感之一的日子：要么你感到兴奋，准备出门为你心爱的人买一张卡片和礼物，或者打电话给镇上最热门的餐馆，试图预订一张桌子给你和你的伴侣或情人。也许你正在赶着去买一瓶香槟，准备一个浪漫的夜晚，并且检查你的零钱看看你是否能负担得起那家昂贵的餐馆饭。在另一方面，也许你是那些认为瓦伦泰因节是由企业创造的，填补圣诞节和复活节之间市场空白的人之一。那么让我告诉你
    - 并不是这样的！
- en: Valentine – or Saint Valentine as the Christians view him was a man who existed
    in extremely early antiquity (around 150AD) and was eventually martyred after
    being jailed for performing marriages for soldiers who were forbidden to marry.
    The Roman Emperor, Claudius II insisted on Valentine’s conversion back to Roman
    Paganism, but when Valentine refused he was executed, but not before he healed
    his jailer’s daughter of her blindness, which prompted the entire household to
    convert to Christianity. For this he was recognised as being martyred for his
    faith in Christianity, and eventually elevated to the rank of Saint, however there
    are many early Christian martyrs by this same name, with many of the records having
    been lost in the Christian persecution in later years. Interestingly, there are
    many Valentines around the same time who were martyred in various Christian persecutions.

  zh: 瓦伦泰因 - 或者基督教徒眼中的圣瓦伦泰因是一位生活在极早期的人物（约公元150年左右），最终被囚禁并因为为被禁止结婚的士兵主持婚礼而殉道。罗马皇帝克劳狄乌斯二世坚持要瓦伦泰因回归罗马异教信仰，但瓦伦泰因拒绝后被处死，但在此之前他治愈了狱卒的女儿的失明，这促使整个家庭皈依基督教。因此他被认定为因其对基督教的信仰而殉道，并最终被封为圣人，然而在后来的基督教迫害中，这位圣人的记录已经大部分丢失。有趣的是，在同一时期，有许多名为瓦伦泰因的基督教殉道者。
- en: So where did this tie into Valentine’s Day becoming about love? Well, from February
    13^(th) until the end of the month, the old, possibly pre-Roman festival of **Lupercalia**
    was held, which happened to coincide with the death of Valentine on the first
    day of the festival (February 14^(th)). The early Christians believed that if
    they superimposed the feast of Saint Valentine to coincide with Lupercalia, they
    could more easily convert pagans into Christians – as has happened with other
    festivals throughout the Wheel of the Year, such as Easter (Ostara) and Christmas
    (Yule). Lupercalia was believed to partly honour the Lupa, a she-wolf which suckled
    orphaned infants and also as an honouring of the founders of Rome, Romulus and
    Remus.

  zh: 那么，这与瓦伦泰因节与爱情的关系是如何联系起来的呢？嗯，从2月13日至月底，古老的，可能是古罗马前的**卢佩卡利亚节**会举行，这恰好与瓦伦泰因在节日第一天（2月14日）去世的时间重叠。早期的基督徒认为，如果他们将圣瓦伦泰因的节日叠加在卢佩卡利亚节上，他们可以更容易地将异教徒转变为基督徒
    - 就像在一年中的其他节日中发生的情况一样，例如复活节（欧斯塔拉）和圣诞节（尤尔）。卢佩卡利亚节部分是为了纪念狼母拉瓦（Lupa），她哺乳孤儿，并且也是对罗马建城者罗穆卢斯和雷姆斯的敬意。
- en: The festivities associated with Lupercalia mainly focused on feasting, dancing
    and cleansing the city of stagnant and negative energies, to help bring in health
    and fertility – not just in the fields, but in the residents as well. The festival
    of Lupercalia was usually led by priests who were known as the Luperci (Brothers
    of the Wolf) who dressed in goatskins and sacrificed two male goats and a male
    dog to the gods, then cut the skin from the animal. The priests would then go
    around the old city and whip people who lined up along the route – it being believed
    that the whippings would result in pregnancy for those who were barren, and less
    pain in childbirth for those who were pregnant.

  zh: 与卢佩尔卡利亚相关的庆典主要集中在宴会、舞蹈和净化城市的停滞和负面能量上，以帮助带来健康和生育力量 - 不仅仅是在田野上，也是在居民身上。卢佩尔卡利亚节通常由称为卢佩尔奇（狼兄弟）的祭司领导，他们身穿山羊皮，向神祭献了两只公山羊和一只公狗，然后剥下动物的皮。然后，祭司们会走遍旧城，鞭打沿路排队的人们
    - 有人相信这种鞭打会导致那些不孕的人怀孕，对那些已经怀孕的人减轻分娩痛苦。
- en: The fact that the Lupercalia was a festival about fertility (and therefore love)
    as the Romans were quite open about their feelings about others, with the martyrdom
    of Valentine at the beginning of the festival in Rome, it made sense for the early
    Christians to superimpose his feast day over the Lupercalia – and eventually both
    gradually became what we know today as Valentine’s Day. While the way the festival
    was originally celebrated has been lost to the history books, the feelings and
    emotions surrounding the day remain the same – a time of love and fertility and
    almost ritualistic courting of love interests. It is also a perfect example of
    the Christianisation of many pagan festivals, as earlier noted.

  zh: 卢佩尔卡利亚是一个关于生育（因此也是关于爱情）的节日，罗马人对他人的感情是非常开放的，随着瓦伦丁在节日期间在罗马的殉教，早期基督徒将他的宴会日与卢佩尔卡利亚叠加起来是有道理的
    - 最终两者逐渐演变成了我们今天所知的情人节。虽然最初庆祝方式已经失落在历史书籍中，但围绕这一天的感情和情绪仍然相同 - 一个爱情和生育的时光，几乎是对爱情兴趣的仪式化求爱。这也是许多异教节日基督教化的一个完美例子，正如早先所述。
