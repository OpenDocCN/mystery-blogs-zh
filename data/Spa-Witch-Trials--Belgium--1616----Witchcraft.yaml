- en: The Spa Witch Trials took place in the city of Spa in present day Belgium (then
    part of the Spanish Netherlands) in 1616\. It was one of the larger and best known
    of the witch trials in Belgium, and led to the execution of ten women, and possibly
    the death of another four.

  zh: 斯帕女巫审判发生在今天的比利时斯帕市（当时是西班牙尼德兰的一部分）于1616年。这是比利时规模较大且较知名的女巫审判之一，导致了十名女性的处决，以及可能另外四名女性的死亡。
- en: The events began early in 1616, when the authorities of Franchimont issued an
    investigation of sorcery after a strange plague had caused the deaths of both
    humans an animals in the area. The public was encouraged to report any suspicious
    gatherings in the forest, anyone absent from work, anyone giving bread to the
    sick (perceived as an attempt to bewitch them), and husbands who suspected their
    wives of committing adultery with devils.

  zh: 事件始于1616年初，当Franchimont的当局因一场奇怪的瘟疫导致该地区的人畜死亡后，发起了对巫术的调查。公众被鼓励报告森林中的任何可疑集会，任何缺席上班的人，任何给病人吃面包的人（被视为试图施以邪术），怀疑他们的妻子与魔鬼通奸的丈夫。
- en: The allegations appear to day to have been very circumstantial. The husband
    of Maroie Herodes gave as evidence for claims that she was a witch the fact that
    she had once felt very cold on return after an absence. Another man had heard
    Isabeau delle Court and Gelette Noel talked of as witches, and claimed that his
    horse had been sick after passing them.

  zh: 看起来这些指控在当时似乎都是凑巧的。Maroie Herodes的丈夫作为她是女巫的证据之一是她曾在外出归来后感觉到非常冷。另一名男子听到Isabeau
    delle Court和Gelette Noel被称为女巫，并声称他的马在经过她们后生病了。
- en: Of the many women who were tried, fourteen were judged guilty and sentenced
    to death by garroting and burning. Ten were executed, and the remaining four possibly
    died in prison during torture.
