- en: Mercury is the planet that rules the mind, thought processes, and communication
    style in Astrology.  It tells us not what we think about, but how we think. Mercury
    is the closest planet to the sun, and moves the fastest. It may be difficult to
    differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is the persona, and Mercury
    is the mind.

    Even if they cannot mentally process them, focusing on where the physical pain
    actually exists in the heart chakra will help them not to dissociate so often.
    This will allow them to give attention to their emotional body without trying
