  zh: 如何定义咒语？
- en: When it comes to unleashing the power of the supernatural, it takes a certain
    spell, which is a recipe that has the intent of generating magic. It may involve
    special herbs, spices, or body parts of animals, placed into a stew while the
    cook recites an incantation while moving their arms and hands to special gesture.
    All of this will be done according to an ancient magical spell. There are thousands
    upon thousands of different incantations that have been used for centuries and
    still are today unbeknownst to the masses. That would be the simple way to **define
    incantations**, now let’s take a look at some examples that might surprise you.

  zh: 许多祝福起源于咒语
- en: One interesting part of history is that many of the blessings that are used
    today began as spells, good spells that is, that were placed on individuals to
    help them prosper in their lives on a daily basis. These spells were usually paid
    for in trade to the local witch or warlock which then laid the blessing in the
    form of an incantation that was made especially for a certain person to help them
    prosper and thrive.

  zh: 历史中一个有趣的部分是，许多今天使用的祝福起源于咒语，即好的咒语，放置在个人身上，帮助他们在日常生活中繁荣。这些咒语通常是以贸易的形式支付给当地的女巫或术士，然后以一种特别为某个人制作的咒语形式来放置祝福，帮助他们繁荣和茁壮成长。
- en: Many of these special blessings were placed on children, especially newborns.
    These also involved special charms and necklaces that were to be worn to ward
    off evil spirits and help them avoid disease, prosper monetarily, and have good
    luck throughout life.

    be both black magic or white magic and obviously one is to help a person prosper,
    while the other is to cause pain and suffering or other evil intentions. Black
    magic calls on negative energy, and certain gods of the underworld, to help bring

    part of many black magic incantations that have been used according to folklore
    and fairy tales from the mid-evil period of time in Europe. In some battles, witches
    were called upon to place these spells onto their enemies of war as just another
    weapon of war.

    that only specially trained wizards and witches could decode since the real meaning
    was carefully hidden in the wording. By carefully chanting the riddle and performing

    most good, but some bad, and they are mostly ridiculed by the common folk. It
    is difficult for most believers in the occult to prove their ability scientifically
    in order to advance beyond merely being considered a hobby or entertainment. Still,
    there are many people that believe in certain parts of incantations such as Ouija
    boards and blessings without understanding their origins as magical spells. In
    order to define incantations completely, it’s important to know their history
    and origins.
