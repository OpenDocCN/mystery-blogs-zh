    are with the internet, but how does this play out with magick?*  A lot of aspiring
    magicians spend their time on social media, and there is no problem with this.
    But, as you learn in the occult, too much of something can eventually lead to
    an imbalance, therefore, we need to pay attention to this so we don''t limit our
    experience in life or compromise what we want with anything less.'

  zh: 就像一个咒语一样，如果有人有特定的意图，然后他们同时考虑很多不同的事情，可能不会导致最一致的结果。
- en: Therefore, it's really important, in magick, to make **a budget for your attention**,
    so to speak, and to cut out mindless "spending habits" when it comes to your thoughts,
    so that you have more focus to put towards accomplishing what you want.

  zh: 因此，在魔法中，制定**注意力预算**非常重要，可以说，要消除无意识的“思维消费习惯”，这样你就能更专注地去实现自己的目标。
- en: Let me give you an example. I took a trip to Barcelona. It was incredible, but
    one thing about it was different from my normal day. When I went on my phone to
    look at whatever AI curated content would come up, it wasn't interesting. In fact,
    **I felt like I could barely bring myself to use my phone at all**. I only took
    one quick glance, now and then, to see that there was nothing really that interesting
    going on and it even made me realize things that I may not have thought about
    in such a way normally by seeing it from a different perspective. I will avoid
    going further into existentialism, but, mainly, I realized that I'm the one on
    vacation and I'm supposed to be having fun, not on my phone!

  zh: 让我举个例子。我去了巴塞罗那旅行。那真是太不可思议了，但有件事与我的日常不同。当我打开手机查看AI策划的内容时，完全没有兴趣。事实上，**我几乎无法自己使用手机**。我偶尔扫一眼，看看没有什么真正有趣的事情发生，甚至让我意识到以前可能没有以这种方式思考过的问题。我不想深入讨论存在主义，但主要是，我意识到我是在度假，我应该享受，而不是沉迷于手机！
- en: It showed me that people get used to the way their life is normally, and the
    news and everything continues **perpetuating the same stories in the same cycles**,
    and things can get stuck in a routine that becomes normalized, but then, one day,
    your life changes, and, suddenly, everything else seems boring in comparison because
    you're the one having fun and doing something different and exciting.  It helped
    me realize that sometimes we get so used to the way our life is that we check
    social media or watch random stuff on YouTube to help break up the pattern of
    the day, even if we have fun and love what we do. And can even become hypnotized
    by it until we lose sight of the important things. But, when we should be having
    fun, we definitely should focus on that! Because if we spent our time looking
    at what other people were doing, it probably wouldn't mean we were having that
    much of a good time.

  zh: 它告诉我，人们习惯于他们生活的方式，新闻和一切都**不断在同样的周期中传播相同的故事**，事物会固步自封成为一种常态，但有一天，你的生活会发生变化，突然间，与之相比，一切都显得无聊，因为你是那个在享受和做一些不同和激动人心事情的人。它帮助我意识到，有时我们对生活方式如此习以为常，以至于会查看社交媒体或在YouTube上观看各种随机内容来打破日常的模式，即使我们感到愉快并热爱我们所做的事情。甚至可能会被它催眠，直到我们迷失了重要的事情。但是，当我们应该享受时，我们一定要专注于这一点！因为如果我们把时间花在看别人在做什么，那可能意味着我们并没有那么愉快。

- en: Let's, then, look at **distractions as something that doesn't align you with
    your goal**. It could very well be that something very useful that seemed like
    a distraction, at first, could actually be in alignment with whatever you want
    to manifest in life and could even be something that you attracted to help your
    manifestation on its way. Therefore, distractions are sometimes subjective, as
    we can use our intuition to figure out which ones are helpful to us in this sense.  Thus,
    we have to budget again so that we make time for certain things that are important.
    Sometimes distractions can be ok, if you can turn them into something that serves
    your purpose - to learn or to motivate you to achieve your goal. Then they aren't
    distractions anymore. And if we can occasionally do this for an amount of time
    that we previously assessed is profitable, and then put our attention back into
    what we're focusing on, then all the better.

    - 学习或激励你实现目标。那么它们就不再是分心了。如果我们偶尔能够在我们之前评估为有利可图的一段时间内这样做，然后将我们的注意力重新集中到我们正在关注的事情上，那就更好了。'
- en: And it may be that some people may want to manifest having more free time to
    enjoy being distracted by things. If that's the case, then it becomes entertainment.
    Or they may want something that, to them, might not seem as distracting as it
    may seem to you. Whatever the case may be, having direct focus on your goal is
    a practice in itself.  And it all depends how you combine that focus with how
    you use time.

    out of your current experience because, if you're too focused on wanting other
    things, how will you truly enjoy what you want once you finally get it? When there
    are so many other things that you also want instead? Therefore, learn to find
    a balance between working towards what you want and enjoying life in the moment.
    Eventually, one day, the two will meet.  Matthew
