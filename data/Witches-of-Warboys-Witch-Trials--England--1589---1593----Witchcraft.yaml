- en: The accusation, trial and execution for witchcraft of Alice Samuel and her family
    in the village of Warboys, in the fens of England, occurred between 1589 and 1593\.
    The course of events followed a pattern which was to become familiar in witch
    persecutions for the next hundred years and prefigured the famous [**Salem Witch
    Trials**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/salem-witch-trials/trials-salem/), which
    exhibited many similar traits.

  zh: 对爱丽丝·塞缪尔及其家人在英格兰芬斯沼泽地区沃伯伊斯村被指控、审判和处以巫术死刑的事件发生在1589年至1593年之间。事件的进程遵循了一个模式，在接下来的一百年里成为了巫术迫害中熟悉的模式，并预示了著名的[**塞勒姆女巫审判**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/salem-witch-trials/trials-salem/)，展现出许多相似的特征。
- en: The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the ten-year-old
    daughter of Robert Throckmorton, the Squire of Warboys, when she started suffering
    from fits. She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause, and this
    was soon echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting
    similar symptoms.

  zh: 首次指控发生在1589年11月，由沃伯伊斯庄主罗伯特·索克莫顿的十岁女儿简·索克莫顿提出，当时她开始出现痉挛。她指控76岁的爱丽丝·塞缪尔是罪魁祸首，很快简的四个姐妹和一些家仆也开始出现类似症状。
- en: The Squire was a close friend of Sir Henry Cromwell, one of the wealthiest commoners
    in England and, when Lady Cromwell came to visit in March 1590, she also accused
    Alice Samuel of being a witch. Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of scissors
    and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a
    folk remedy believed to weaken a witch’s power). That night, Lady Cromwell had
    nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.

  zh: 该庄主是英格兰最富有的平民之一亨利·克伦威尔爵士的密友，当克伦威尔夫人于1590年3月来访时，她也指控爱丽丝·塞缪尔是女巫。据说克伦威尔夫人抓起一把剪刀，剪下了爱丽丝的一缕头发，并交给索克莫顿夫人烧掉（一种被认为能削弱女巫力量的民间疗法）。那个晚上，克伦威尔夫人做噩梦，病倒了，后来于1592年去世。
- en: The local parson persuaded Alice to confess to witchcraft in 1592, but she recanted
    the very next day. However, she confessed again when brought before the Bishop
    of Lincoln, and was taken to Huntingdon where she was imprisoned with her daughter,
    Agnes, and her husband, John. All three were tried in April 1593 for the murder
    by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell (“Madam, why do
    you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet”) were used against her at the
    trial, and all three were found guilty and hanged.

  zh: 当地牧师说服爱丽丝在1592年承认自己是女巫，但她在第二天就收回了这个说法。然而，当她被带到林肯主教面前时，她再次承认，并被带到亨廷顿监禁，与她的女儿阿格尼丝和丈夫约翰一起。他们三人于1593年4月因被指控用巫术谋杀克伦威尔夫人而受审。爱丽丝对克伦威尔夫人说的话（“夫人，你为什么这样对待我？我还没有伤害过你”）在审判中被用来指控她，三人被判有罪并被绞死。
