- en: Saturn-Midheaven aspects will show how serious, restricted, reserved, pragmatic,
    or focused you appear. The Midheaven often refers to public image, so Saturn tends
    to *restrict* the public image when it aspects the Midheaven.

  zh: 土星-中天相位会显示你显得多么严肃、受限、保守、务实或专注。中天通常指公众形象，因此土星在影响中天时往往会*限制*公众形象。
- en: However, Saturn is also the planet associated with Capricorn, a sign that indicates
    business and career success. Capricorn can be quite image-driven, so Saturn-Midheaven
    aspects don’t always mean that your appearance will be stunted or muted.

  zh: 土星合中天
- en: When Saturn conjuncts the Midheaven, your public appearance is inherently karmic.
    You will need to work through your image and come to terms with it. This doesn’t
    mean that you can’t be successful, it just indicates that you will never *appear*
    the way you want to.

- en: You may have experienced the absence of your father figure as well. The way
    that this absence manifested will depend on the sign that Saturn conjunct Midheaven
    is in. For example, Midheaven in Capricorn can indicate a father who didn’t provide
    for you monetarily, while Midheaven in water signs will point to emotional absence.
  id: totrans-15

  zh: 你可能也经历过缺少父亲形象的情况。这种缺失的表现方式取决于土星合中天位于哪个星座。例如，中天位于摩羯座可能表示父亲在金钱上未能为你提供支持，而中天位于水象星座则可能意味着情感上的缺失。
- en: This lack of a father figure created a drive to seek recognition. You look to
    other people to tell you when you’ve done a good job. However, you run into a
    blank wall and tend to feel those same negative feelings again, because you don’t
    get the validation you want.

    Others may brush you off, even if your achievements are worth recognition. You
    may been seen as too private, reserved, odd, boring, or cold. Often, the way that
    others see you will be influenced by the sing that Saturn conjunct Midheaven sits

- en: You may feel criticized no matter what you do. This judgment can come from your
    parents, from larger groups, or from the public eye in general. Unlike other people,
