    AND http://mermaidblog14.blogspot.com/p/physical-shifting.html ) F shift/Fantasy
    shift: This is, in essence, basically just visualization and meditation. You have
    to imagine yourself as a mermaid, swimming around and doing whatever you think
    mermaids do! Its great for beginning, and helps you understand what you think
    your mermaid will look like, what the water against your skin will feel like,
    etc. It is important to note that you must meditate from the mermaid''s/your point
    of view. Do not see yourself as a mermaid, see as if you were a mermaid, if that
    makes sense. A shift/ Astral Shifting: While this shifting technique is very helpful
    and probably important, it is not necessarily needed to shift. Basically, it would
    be where you take your spirit out of your body, and go to an astral plane. There,
    you can shift your body into... pretty much whatever you want. Unfortunately,
    astral travel is insanely hard, and I have not yet figured out how to do it. Therefor,
    I will not be covering it in this site. If someone who knows how wishes to help,
    then that would be great.   Ph-shift/ Phantom shifting: This type of shifting
    gets a lot of results, and is one thing that a lot of P shifters use to get them
    ready for shifting (talk about that down there). This is where you literally feel
    what the mermaid tail (and top, maybe) will feel like. You dont officially HAVE the
    tail, but the energy surrounding you lets you feel the tail as if it where actually
    there. A good example would be to, say, pinch a part of your arm. After you pinch
    it, wait a few seconds, and then imagine feeling that pinch on your arm again.
    You may not actually feel it, but at the same time, you might.  M shift/Mental
    shifting: This ones going to be hard for us. This is where you change your mind
    to think like a mermaid, and you change your actions to that of a mermaid. Whats
    so hard about this, is that we don’t really know how mermaids act or think! However,
    I have compiled some ideas on how they might act, and how you can use that into
    your daily life.  MF shift/ Mental Flaring: This one will also be hard, as you
    let your animalistic (mermaidistic) side completely take over your brain. You
    would obviously bring yourself back later, but it exercises your bond with that
    part of you. Unfortunately, once again, we have NO idea how mermaids think, and
    furthermore, how to let that part of you take over. So this ones going to be a
    hard one as well. I will, however, try my hardest to help with the MF shift. 
    P shifting/physical shifting: Alright, this ones the biggy. Its the one where
    you completely shift yourself into your mermaid self. This is obviously the hardest
    of the shifts, and involves a lot of work and concentration. Like I said before,
    phantom shifting helps with this one! PNR/ Point of no return: Now, I know this
    sounds cheesy, but in the werewolf goal they talk constantly of not letting yourself
    go over the PNR. If you do, your normally stuck. However, the reason you are stuck
    is genrally because you lose all of your humanity and human thought power. Thus,
    you wouldn’t even know how to shift back. This would be a confusing subject on
    mermaids, because as far as we’re concerned, their an intelligent species. So
    I warn you before going any further, I’m not sure if mermaid shifting has a PNR or
    not, but its best to be careful.'

    和 [这里](http://mermaidblog14.blogspot.com/p/physical-shifting.html)) F变换/幻想变换：基本上就是想象和冥想。你必须把自己想象成一只美人鱼，在水中游动并做你认为美人鱼会做的事情！这对初学者非常有帮助，帮助你理解你认为你的美人鱼会是什么样子，水在皮肤上的感觉等等。重要的是要注意，你必须从美人鱼/你的视角冥想。不要把自己看作是美人鱼，而是视作如果你是美人鱼，如果这样说得通的话。A变换/星体变换：虽然这种变换技术非常有帮助，可能也很重要，但不一定需要变换。基本上，你将你的灵魂从身体中取出，去到一个星体位面。在那里，你可以将你的身体变成……基本上任何你想要的形象。不幸的是，星体旅行非常困难，我还没有弄清楚如何做到。因此，我不会在这个网站上涵盖它。如果有知道方法的人愿意帮忙，那将会很棒。Ph变换/幻影变换：这种类型的变换产生了很多效果，是许多P变换者用来为变换做准备的一种方法（在下面会讨论）。这是你真正感受到美人鱼尾巴（和上半身，也许）会有的感觉。你并没有真正拥有尾巴，但是围绕你的能量让你感受到尾巴就好像它真的在那里一样。一个很好的例子是，比如，掐一下你的手臂的一部分。掐完后，等几秒钟，然后想象再次感受到手臂上的那一掐。你可能实际上感觉不到，但与此同时，你可能会感觉到。M变换/心理变换：这对我们来说将会很难。这是你改变你的思维方式去像美人鱼一样思考，并且你改变你的行为方式去符合美人鱼的行为。为什么这么难，是因为我们并不真的知道美人鱼如何行动或思考！然而，我已经整理了一些关于它们可能如何行动的想法，以及你如何将这些想法融入到你的日常生活中。MF变换/心理闪耀：这个也将会很难，因为你要让你的动物（美人鱼）一面完全控制你的大脑。显然之后你会恢复过来，但这锻炼了你与那一面的联系。不幸的是，再次地，我们并不知道美人鱼如何思考，而且更进一步，如何让你的那一面接管。所以这也将会是一个很难的问题。然而，我会尽我最大的努力来帮助你进行MF变换。P变换/物理变换：好了，这个是重头戏。这是你将自己完全转变成你的美人鱼自我的变换。显然，这是变换中最难的，需要大量的工作和集中注意力。就像我之前说的，幻影变换对这一点很有帮助！PNR/无法回头点：现在，我知道这听起来很俗套，在狼人的目标中，他们不断地谈论不要让自己超过PNR。如果你这样做了，通常你就会被困住。然而，你被困住的原因通常是因为你失去了所有的人性和人类的思维能力。因此，你甚至不知道如何变回来。这在美人鱼方面可能是一个令人困惑的话题，因为据我们所知，它们是一个智能种类。所以在继续之前，我警告你，我不确定美人鱼变换是否有PNR，但最好小心。

    what you base your tail on looking like) so that you can begin building your mermaid.
    Also, you''re going to have to figure out what environment you will be swimming
    in. If you live near lakes, then your mermaid would probably have a darker tail
    color, lungs instead of gills, and would be a freshwater mermaid. However, if
    you live next to a coral reef, then your mermaid might have a bright tail color,
    gills, and would be a salt water mermaid. It all really depends on the environment.

    Many people will say you also need correct posture, although I for one am not

    your nose, and out through your mouth. Then, begin counting as you breath....
    As you breath in, count to three. Hold your breath for three counts, and finally
    exhale for three counts. You shouldn't be gasping for air or holding your breath;
    this type of breathing is supposed to relax you. Remember, this breathing comes
    naturally to your body, so after a few times of counting your breaths you should
    be able to breath like this on your own.

    close your eyes and write out each letter in your mind. See the letter, say it
    out loud, almost feel your hand writing the letter. Feel each letter, and then
    let it go completely. You should spend about five seconds on each letter. Remember
    to not let your mind wander, and to not slip out of the moment (which is easy
    to do if you're tired!).  Try and see each letter in a place between your eyes
    and your mind, if that makes sense.

    your mind. I know, this sounds very hard, but with practice it comes easier. Just
    think of absolutely... nothing. Don't think at all! It helps to begin with imagining
    yourself putting all of your thoughts and feeling and urges to move into a box
    and shoving it under a bed somewhere. Once you begin meditating, if you encounter a
    thought then the best way to get of it is to actually let it come into your mind...
    and then let it drift out. Acknowledge the thought, but let it leave your mind
    with peace. Simply trying to shove everything out of your mind won't work at all,
    things will just keep popping in. Finally, remember to focus on the nothingness,
    and not on keeping things out of your mind. Let the clarity of nothingness just
    wash over your mind. Don't worry, I know its hard, but no one expects you to be
    perfect!

  zh: 接下来的方法是清空你的头脑……坐直确实有助于这一点。坐在舒适的地方，闭上眼睛，完全清空你的头脑。我知道，这听起来很困难，但练习后就会变得更容易。只是想象自己将所有的思想、感觉和想要移动的冲动都放进一个盒子里，把它塞到床底下的某个地方。一旦你开始冥想，如果你遇到一个念头，那么摆脱它的最好方法就是让它进入你的脑海……然后让它漂走。承认这个想法，但让它带着平静离开你的脑海。简单地试图把一切都从你的头脑中挤出去是行不通的，事物只会不断地进入。最后，记住要专注于空无，而不是保持思维空白。让空无的清晰洗涤你的头脑。别担心，我知道这很难，但没有人期望你完美！

    M-Shifting is not as easy or strait forward as meditations or research. Lets view
    M-shifting as a big fence. Once you climb over it, its going to be really hard
    to climb back out again. Likewise, once you M-shift your mind and soul into that
    of a mermaids... its going to be really hard to go back to normal living. The
    ocean (or water in general) will call to you. You will be changed emotionally,
    mentally, and hopefully physically once you get to P-shifting. Therefor, it is
    my job to warn you right now that becoming a mermaid may not be the best thing
    for you. If you don't live next to a body of water like a ocean or lake... then
    what? Are you just going to sit in a bathtub looking at your tail for the next
    few years of your life? Like I said, the shifting method does not give you powers.
    Powers are something that you can get, but probably not from shifting (although
    if you would like to try with the shifting method, be my guest). Because of these
    two traits, it could be that you just want to be a mermaid because you want to
    be something special. A lot of us feel that way too, you're not alone... but please,
    just pause and ask yourself if you really want this. With that note of warning,
    lets begin your next step... M-shifting.

    再回归正常生活将会非常困难。海洋（或者说水一般）会呼唤你。在你到达P-转换时，你的情感、思维以及希望身体都将发生改变。因此，现在我要警告你，成为美人鱼可能不是你的最佳选择。如果你并不住在像海洋或湖泊一样的水体旁边...
    那又怎么办呢？难道你只会坐在浴缸里几年时间盯着你的尾巴吗？正如我所说，转换方法并不会给你超能力。超能力可以通过其他途径获得，但可能不是通过转换（尽管如果你愿意用转换方法尝试，随你便）。由于这两个特点，可能只是因为你想成为特别的某个东西，你才想成为美人鱼。很多人也有这种感觉，你并不孤单...
    但请暂停一下，问问自己你真的想要这样吗？在警告的基础上，让我们开始你的下一步... M-转换。
- en: M-Shifting, as was cleared up before hand, is basically changing your mind and
    attitude to that of a mermaid. Unfortunately, mermaids are half way humans, and
    therefor don't really have an animal instinct or anything that you could draw
    from. Luckily for you however, if you've been following these lessons, then you
    now have a nice idea of how fish and dolphins act, and how your mermaid looks
    and acts. All of that is really important, because there is no set version of
    a mermaid. So, remember that mermaid drawing and research you did? Get all of
    that out and go over it now. It may be apparent to you, but I'm pretty sure everyone
    is going to come up with their own ideas and needs for what a mermaid IS, and
    so each and every person trying the shifting method needs to really look into
    behavior (i.e., a tropical mermaid that has lots of food resources and not many predators might
    have a different behavior then an arctic mermaid who is always looking for food.
    Likewise, a lake mermaid may eat and act differently in their confined space,
    than an ocean mermaid that has everywhere in the world)  . Of course, you should
    have already done all of this, but if you haven't for whatever reason, then its
    REALLY good for you to do that right now.

    you'll need to really change your life a lot. This is important, because it gets
    you used to this type of living, lets your mind draw out your inner mermaid, and connects
    you to the ocean and its spirit in a way that you may not have been before. Of

- en: '**Diet:** I believe mermaids would diffidently have to eat a mixed diet of
    both fish, shell fish, sea plants and possibly fruit. Now let me explain on this
    one. For our definition of a “mermaid” to fit the beautiful women with a gorgeous
    fish tail, we have to find a way to keep the human part of the mermaid looking HUMAN.
    Now imagine if mermaids only ate meat. That would make them predators, which would
    alter their appearances greatly. They would probably have more snout like noses,
    gills for sure, a fast, efficient tail that probably blends into the water (not
    exactly that gorgeous blue or pink that many of you want). The skin would probably
    take on a blueish tone, and the teeth would be sharp. For some reason, I dont
    think most of you want to be that when you think of being a mermaid. However,
    if a mermaid only ate sea plant life, they might wind up being somewhere at the
    opposite of the scale and look equally as odd. This puts mermaids in the position
    of eating a mixed diet, that somewhat mimics what humans eat. I added fruit in
    the main diet because we want to become mermaids who can walk on land, and therefor,
    they would probably be able to grab a bit of tropical fruit from the trees and
    such that tend to live near the water. It is also important that everyone adapt
    this image to their mermaid as best as possible. Once again, if you live near
    a lake, your mermaids diet will be different from someone living near the ocean,
    so on and so forth. So, with this information, we can bring this diet into our
    own. Try to eat fruit that grows naturally around your mermaids area. Eating shellfish,
    seaweed, and sushi is also very good too! Try researching the area that you live
    in, or where your mermaid comes from. See what grows naturally, and how you can incorporate that
    into every day life.'

  zh: '**饮食：** 我认为美人鱼肯定需要吃混合饮食，包括鱼类、贝类、海洋植物，可能还有水果。现在让我解释一下这一点。为了符合我们对“美人鱼”的定义，即美丽的女性配上华丽的鱼尾，我们必须找到一种方法来保持美人鱼的人类部分看起来像**人类**。现在想象一下，如果美人鱼只吃肉。那将使它们成为捕食者，这将极大地改变它们的外貌。它们可能会有更多像吻的鼻子，肯定会有鳃，一条快速高效的尾巴，可能会融入水中（不会像你们中许多人想要的那种华丽的蓝色或粉色）。皮肤可能会呈现出蓝色调，牙齿可能会很锋利。出于某种原因，我认为大多数人在想象成为美人鱼时，并不希望成为**那样**。然而，如果美人鱼只吃海洋植物生活，它们可能会在相反的极端看起来同样奇怪。这就把美人鱼置于需要吃混合饮食的位置，这种饮食在某种程度上**模仿**了人类的饮食。我在主要的饮食中加入了水果，因为我们想成为能够在陆地上行走的美人鱼，因此它们可能能够从树上抓一点热带水果之类的东西，这些树通常生长在水边。同样重要的是，每个人都要尽可能地将这个形象应用到自己的美人鱼身上。再次强调，如果你住在湖边，你的美人鱼的饮食将与住在海洋附近的人不同，依此类推。因此，有了这些信息，我们可以将这种饮食带入我们的生活中。尽量吃那些在你的美人鱼所在地自然生长的水果。吃贝类、海藻和寿司也非常好！试着**研究**一下你所在的地区，或者你的美人鱼来自哪里。看看什么东西在那里自然生长，以及如何将其**融入**到日常生活中。'
- en: '**Habitat- **Well, we''re back to this one, that seems to pop up everywhere!
    Your mermaids habitat. Your mermaid''s habitat pretty much effects everything
    about your mermaid''s looks, diet, personality, and just about everything else.
    Therefor, it is very important. So, lets begin with some science. To maintain
    the upper part of a human, a mermaid would need to be warm blooded I believe.
    However, they may not be as warm blooded as humans are, due to their fish tail.
    Given this, a mermaid would be able to survive in some cold areas, but would really
    thrive in warmer ones. I personally would say that mermaid would thrive the best
    somewhere in the Caribbean, or in Hawaii. Unfortunately, there are not many of
    us that are fortunate enough to live in areas like that. So, it would be my guess
    that most of our mermaids would probably have to migrate in order to stay alive.
    Take all of this into consideration in how you design your mermaid''s fluke and
    all of that. Is it good for long distance travel? Anyway, while a mermaid''s habitat
    would most likely be some place warm or tropical, we''ll just have to adjust ourselves.
    Some good things that you might want to monitor in your Shifting might be your
    body temperature (going down would be good), or if you find yourself drawn to
    warmer places. Likewise, if you live in really cold places, you may find that
    you can tolerate the cold a lot. Either way, just make sure to monitor physical
    changes.'

- en: '**Social Behavior- **When you imagine a mermaid swimming freely in the ocean,
    what do you see? Well, you probably don''t see that mermaid swimming along in
    a group of three to six mermaids. However, with the science that I''ve found,
    I believe that in "pods" would be exactly how mermaids travel! Take dolphins for
    example. They are probably one of the closest relatives to the mermaid, and are
    therefor really good to learn from. Dolphins live in pods, or groups, of three
    to eight, and usually have some sort of "leader" dolphin. Dolphins have very special
    and unique bonds with one another, and are said to be closer than some human families.
    These pods travel together, live together, and stay together for most of their
    life. So, bringing that into mermaid context, it could be conceivable that mermaids
    live in groups. How does that effect your M-shift and life? Well, one thing you
    could do is try to connect with your group or family. Find a group that really
    understands you, and treat them like your mermaid "pod." It is also very useful
    to try and find some people in real life (as well as the internet) that actually
    want to become a mermaid as much as you do, or would at least understand your
    wish. This can both be supporting to you, and help you with the whole "pod," aspect

- en: '**Personal Looks- **Here is when we get into a touchier subject. It may come
    to your attention that you may not look like the mermaid that you''ve drawn out
    earlier. For instance, if your mermaid were a tropical mermaid, they would probably
    have tan skin to deal with the sun. If your mermaid lived out in the middle of
    the ocean, or deeper in the ocean, or maybe even in a lake... then their skin
    may be paler. Adjusting your looks to that of your mermaid can be very important
    in an M-shift, and help your mind get used to "changing." Also, (here comes the
    touchy part) if you are a bit over weight or out of shape, you may want to get
    that taken care of. One, because its really healthy if you do, and two because
    think about it... mermaid swimming takes just about every aspect of your muscles,
    and requires you to be a strong swimmer. The more weight, or the less muscle,
    the harder it is to swim. I know, I know, it is a hard subject, but believe me

    it has a lot to do with habitat, and with dolphins! As said before in the Social
    Behavior aspect, I believe mermaids share close bonds with dolphins. I think that
    if you were to mimic a mermaid, your first thing to do would to be learning from
    dolphins and other fish. This means being playful, enthusiastic, loving, loyal,
    and generally good learners. Next comes the habitat. Say your mermaid lives in
    a very cold region... Well, that may result in your mermaid being "colder" in
    attitude. Those mermaids would need to focus a lot more on survival than those
    living in tropical waters. Therefor, if you live in colder areas, you may need
    to adjust to taking note of your surroundings, and bringing your body into survival
    mode. However, if you live in warm areas, your mermaid might have playful attributes

    playful、enthusiastic、loving、loyal、以及一般上是优秀的学习者。接下来是栖息地。假设你的美人鱼生活在非常寒冷的地区……嗯，这可能导致你的美人鱼在态度上更“冷淡”。那些美人鱼需要更多地专注于生存，而不是那些生活在热带水域的美人鱼。因此，如果你生活在寒冷的地区，你可能需要调整注意你的周围环境，并让你的身体进入生存模式。然而，如果你生活在温暖的地区，你的美人鱼也可能有一些好玩的特点。或者，如果你的美人鱼迁徙，你可能需要比那些无忧无虑的热带美人鱼更有耐力。等等。'

    down, shells adorning your body, and maybe some water proof makeup will probably
    make you feel a lot more like a mermaid away from home. For right now, don't even
    worry too much about if the accessories are accurate, or if mermaids ever wear
    makeup (they probably don't) or anything like that. Right now, you are just trying
    to feel like you are one! Another thing that helps so much is a fake mermaid tail
    or monofin. I have both, and believe me, it really makes you feel one with the
    water. Unfortunately, it also make you feel one with an empty wallet! Mermaid
    tails and monofins can be very expensive, especially if you have big feet like
    myself, and are forced into buying the $80, larger monofin, instead of the smaller
    ones that cost around $30-$50\. Also, the materials can cost a lot.... or, if

    location. If you're just sitting on your bed in the middle of the night, or at
    school or something, then an M-Flare might be a little difficult. Remember- mermaids
    SWIM. They are meant to be submersed in water, swimming freely among their environment.
    So, while sitting in your bathtub may be a little bit better than sitting on your
    bed... well, its still not very good. For M-Flaring, I would suggest making your
    way to a pool, a lake, or even an ocean! My personal suggestion would be a nice
    salt water pool... there is a lot less harmful chlorine, its a lot more like the
    ocean, and you can open your eyes underwater! Further, there is room to swim,
    but its not as dangerous as the ocean or as dirty as a lake. Of course, on the
    down side... its not as natural. So, a good thing to do would be to have a mixture
    of each. If your mermaid is a lake mermaid, then I would try fresh water pools
    and ponds, and also swimming in the lake a lot. If you are an ocean mermaid, then
    I would try salt water pools and the oceans... but be careful. The ocean can have
    strong tides and currents, which are easily over come for mermaids, but not for
    humans. So, when swimming in the ocean, just make sure that you are at a very
    shallow or safe area before swimming. Also, if you are swimming with your fake
    mermaid tail, I would suggest having someone watch over you, just to make sure
    nothing bad happens. A dead human would not make a very good mermaid!

  zh: 现在，对于心智闪光来说第二个超级重要的事情可能是你的位置。如果你只是在半夜坐在床上，或者在学校之类的地方，那么M-Flare可能会有点困难。记住——美人鱼游泳。它们被设计为在水中游动，自由地在它们的环境中游动。所以，虽然坐在浴缸里可能比坐在床上好一点……嗯，但还是不太好。对于M-Flaring，我建议你前往游泳池、湖泊，甚至海洋！我个人的建议是一个漂亮的海水泳池……那里的有害氯气较少，更像海洋，你可以在水下睁开眼睛！此外，那里有足够的游泳空间，但比海洋不那么危险，也不像湖泊那样脏。当然，缺点是它不够自然。因此，最好的办法是两者都有所涉及。如果你的美人鱼是湖泊的美人鱼，那么我建议尝试淡水游泳池和池塘，还有频繁在湖里游泳。如果你是海洋的美人鱼，那么我建议尝试海水游泳池和海洋……但要小心。海洋可能有强大的潮汐和洋流，这对美人鱼来说很容易克服，但对人类来说不是。所以，在海洋游泳时，请确保你在非常浅或安全的区域游泳。此外，如果你穿着假美人鱼尾游泳，我建议有人看着你，以确保没有发生不好的事情。一具死去的人类不会成为一个很好的美人鱼！
- en: Alright, now that you've got the two most important things all out of the way,
    its time for you to actually start M-flaring! While you can do small M-Flares
    anywhere, I would suggest setting a day aside just to M-Flare. You won't be like
    that all day long, but it would be a day to be... especially mermaid-like. For
    instance, that morning, you would wake up... and instead of taking a shower, you
    could take a bath and light a candle. Or, you could take a shower and use some
    body wash that reminds you of the ocean. While getting ready for the day, you
    could put on some water proof make up that makes you look like a mermaid... in
    your view at least. Do your hair with beach waves, or strait. Just have fun with
    it, there is not right or wrong! You could wear shells, and the color of your
    tail with a bathing suit underneath. For breakfast lunch and dinner, you could
    adjust your diet to that of a mermaids... (whatever you think a mermaid's diet
    would be! My ideas and thoughts are in the Tips and Ideas section!). Just spend
    the whole day in a bit of a mermaid daze. Then, when the time comes for you to
    actually M-Flare, you'll already be halfway there.

  zh: 好了，现在你已经搞定了最重要的两件事情，是时候开始“M-Flare”了！虽然你可以在任何地方进行小小的M-Flare，但我建议你把一天的时间专门留给M-Flare。你不会整天都像那样，但那一天会是…特别像美人鱼的一天。比如说，早上起床的时候，你可以…不洗澡，可以泡个澡并点燃一支蜡烛。或者你可以洗个澡，用一些让你想起海洋的沐浴露。在准备一天的时候，你可以涂上一些防水的妆容，让自己看起来像美人鱼…至少在你的视角下是这样。用海浪般的发型或者把头发拉直。尽情享受吧，没有对错之分！你可以戴贝壳，穿着泳衣，颜色和你的尾巴相配。早餐、午餐和晚餐，你可以调整饮食，仿照美人鱼的饮食…（你认为美人鱼的饮食是什么！我的想法和思路都在提示和想法部分！）。就这样在美人鱼般的迷离中度过整整一天。然后，当你真正需要进行M-Flare的时候，你已经做好了一半的准备。
- en: So, I would begin in an area that you can sit or even lay down in the water
    without the water going into your nose, mouth, or eyes. Close your eyes and completely
    relax. Let the water wash over you, in your physical body. Feel the spirit of
    the ocean... the spirit of the mermaid washing over with every wave. Let the water
    draw this mermaid part of you out from your soul, and into your mind. Let your
    human mind go blank, and let mermaid thoughts and feels sweep through you. Don't
    worry, you still think, and you'll still need to breath air, and you won't lose
    yourself. Just change your mind into that of a mermaid. Feel a mermaids cravings,
    her instincts and thoughts. Finally, get up, and letting the mermaid part of you
    move you, slip into the water and swim. Remember, you are not swimming like a
    human. You are using your legs to kick up and down, and you are gracefully rolling
    through the water. Open your eyes if you can and look around. If you are in a
    swimming pool, open your eyes and imagine that right before you is coral,or sea
    weed, or the mucky bottom of a lake. Do not swim at the surface, but go down into
    the water. Don't worry about breathing; your body will bring you back to the surface
    and you won't drown. Likewise, don't try to push yourself too much with holding
    your breath. Just let your body do what it needs to do. I've actually found that
    in this state, sometimes your lungs won't start to hurt... they won't tell you
    that you desperately need to breath or anything. You just sit there wondering
    when you're going to need to come up for air, which usually happens after a while,
    but it also lets you hold your breath longer. Anyway, just try to enjoy yourself
    in this state. Be how you think a mermaid would be, in an out of the water. You
    should come out of your M-Flare feeling whole and connected to your other self.

  zh: 所以，我会从一个你可以坐下甚至躺在水中而不让水进入你的鼻子、嘴巴或眼睛的区域开始。闭上眼睛完全放松。让水在你的身体里冲刷。感受大海的灵魂……每一波浪都洗净了你的人体，洗去了美人鱼的灵魂。让水将你灵魂深处的美人鱼一部分拽出来，注入你的心灵。让你的人类思维变成一片空白，让美人鱼的思绪和感觉在你身上横扫。不用担心，你依然会思考，还需要呼吸空气，你不会迷失自我。只是把你的思维转变成美人鱼的模样。感受美人鱼的渴望、本能和思绪。最后，起身，让美人鱼的一部分驱使你，滑入水中并游泳。记住，你不是像人类那样游泳。你用双腿上下踢水，优雅地在水中滚动。如果可以的话，睁开眼睛看看周围。如果你在游泳池里，睁开眼睛，想象你面前就是珊瑚、海草或湖底的淤泥。不要在水面游泳，而是下到水里。不要担心呼吸；你的身体会带你回到水面，你不会淹死。同样，不要试图太用力屏住呼吸。只需让身体自然而然地做它需要做的事情。实际上，在这种状态下，有时你的肺不会开始疼痛……它们不会告诉你你急需呼吸或任何东西。你只是坐在那里想知道什么时候需要上来换气，通常过一会儿会这样，但它也让你屏住呼吸更长时间。总之，试着在这种状态下享受自己。成为你认为美人鱼应该成为的样子，在水中和水外。你应该在M-Flare结束时感到完整，与你的另一半连接在一起。

- en: '**P-SHIFT:** Now this is how you would do your p-shift, what I (Brooke) recommend
    is that you let your mind tell you what to do, I think i''m so deep into shifting
    that all I can talk about is shifting, literally, my friend has gotten annoyed
    at me for not being normal for once. So off of my life, and onto yours!  So for
    p-shifting I would either let your mind and body tell you what to do to try to
    bring out your mermaid side (if you''re deep into the process), or practice the
    phantom-shifting technique, the one where you feel you have a tail, and all. This
    hasn''t been on many lists of shifting as it is considered unimportant. The phantom
    shifting has only supposed to have been for you to meditate, but it''s now helping
    me p-shift.  The p-shift means physical-shift, basically doing what the name insists,
    physically shifting into a mermaid with a tail and gills and all! But if you don''t
    know much about gills and expanded lungs I will tell you in the upcoming paragraphs!
    For now, some techniques for p-shifting. I will tell you the technique for ph-shifting,
    unless you already know this, then skip the first technique. Technique No. 1:
    Phantom Shifting technique: Sit in a comfortable position, legs right in front
    of you, together as if your legs were molded together, now lightly hold your legs
    together, not with your hands, rest your hands on your stomach, not by the sides
    of your legs. Now lie your back down once you know you are ready and breathe in
    through your nose, and out through your mouth. Keep on doing this, while FEELING
    as if your legs are slowly molding together, do NOT imagine in your mind your
    legs molding together, you have to feel it. Feel your legs getting closer and
    closer, until they mold together (even if it''s not happening in real life, you
    still have to feel it, it may happen after multiple tries!) Feel as your feel
    are connecting and stretching out into a long, sturdy, fluke in the shape that
    you desire. Now unless you are in the bath do not shift gills. Feel your legs
    slowly, very slowly coming together and forming scales, then slowly turning the
    desired color. Once you feel the need or want to leave, then go. Unless this has
    worked so far and you got your legs to mold together you have to meditate and
    try to reverse this and get out of it. There, you''re done! Technique No. 2: Under
    Construction:  **Gills and Lungs:** Now that we''ve got most things covered, (unless
    you skipped a whole bunch of stuff, most things are very important) we are going
    to cover gills, and lungs. For those of you that are younger, or just do not know,
    you CANNOT have gills on land. If you tried shifting gills in your bedroom or
    living room, go to the bathroom immediately and wash some water on your neck/behind
    your ears/wherever you have your gills and run a bath immediately.  once you have
    get in it and let your gills breathe. See gills, if you got gills on land or in
    your house, not in a bathtub, you would die. See if you had gills, they are just
    an overpowering way of breathing, you would instinctively start breathing with
    your gills, as you would in the ocean, but if there was no water around to get
    oxygen from you would die. Mermaid gills are in your nose, and behind your ears.
    Every mermaid has these gills, but if you really don''t want these or you just
    want to perpetually hold your breath instead with expanded lungs be my guest.
    In addition to regular mermaid gills, you could also have and add on either gills,
    placed directly on the ribcage, or gills placed on the front sides of your neck.
    Remember that you need to know exactly everything about gills, how they work on
    the inside, etc. You need to know where your lungs are/where your air tube is
    and have those gills have areas to breathe from there. Now we have lungs. if you
    would like you could have ONE large lung. But this may be harder for some, as
    you need to know where it would be, how the organs around you would work, etc.
    I personally would rather have gills, as I find them more easy shift into, but
    onto expanded lungs. For this you have to shift the insides of your body so you
    have one large lung, but you would need to come up for more air every once in
    a while because these are NOT gills and you cannot stay underwater forever with
    expanded lungs.  **~Coral Sirenia**  ___________'

  zh: '**P-SHIFT：** 现在，这是你如何进行P-shift的方法，我（布鲁克）建议你让你的心告诉你该怎么做，我觉得我对转移的深入理解，几乎所有我能谈论的都是转移，我的朋友因为我一次都不正常而对我感到恼火。所以关于我的生活，再说你的！所以对于P-shifting，我建议你让你的心灵和身体告诉你应该怎么做来尝试展现你的人鱼一面（如果你已经深入到这个过程中），或者练习幻影转移技术，这种技术让你感觉自己有尾巴等等。这在许多转移清单中并不常见，因为它被认为不重要。幻影转移原本只是用来冥想的，但现在它帮助我进行P-shift。P-shift意味着物理转移，基本上就是按其名字所暗示的，身体转变为一个有尾巴、鳃等等的人鱼！但如果你对鳃和扩展肺不太了解，我将在接下来的段落中告诉你！现在，一些P-shift的技术。我将告诉你Ph-shifting的技术，除非你已经知道了这些，那么可以跳过第一个技术。技术1：幻影转移技术：坐在舒适的位置，把腿放在你面前，像你的腿已经模拟在一起一样，现在轻轻地把你的腿放在一起，不要用手，把手放在你的胃上，不要放在腿的两侧。当你准备好后，躺下来，通过鼻子吸气，嘴巴呼气。继续这样做，同时感觉你的腿慢慢模拟在一起，不要在你的脑海中想象你的腿在模拟在一起，你必须感受到它。感受你的腿越来越接近，直到它们在一起模拟（即使在现实生活中没有发生，你仍然必须感受到它，可能在多次尝试后才会发生！）感受到你的腿在连接并伸展成一个长长的、结实的、尾巴的形状，你想要的形状。现在，除非你在浴缸中，不要改变鳃。感受你的腿慢慢地、非常慢慢地聚集在一起，形成鳞片，然后慢慢地变成你想要的颜色。一旦你感觉需要或想要离开，那就离开。除非到目前为止这种方法已经奏效，你已经让你的腿模拟在一起，否则你必须冥想并尝试逆转这一过程并摆脱它。好了，你完成了！技术2：正在建设中：**鳃和肺**：现在我们已经覆盖了大部分内容（除非你跳过了很多东西，大部分内容都非常重要），我们要讨论鳃和肺。对于那些年轻的人，或者只是不知道的人，你不能在陆地上有鳃。如果你尝试在卧室或客厅中改变鳃，立即去浴室，将水洗在你的脖子/耳后/任何你有鳃的地方，并立即放个浴。一旦你进入浴缸，让你的鳃呼吸。看到鳃，如果你在陆地上或你的房子里有鳃，不是在浴缸里，你会死的。如果你有鳃，它们只是一种强大的呼吸方式，你会本能地开始通过鳃呼吸，就像你在海洋中一样，但如果周围没有水来获取氧气，你会死的。人鱼的鳃在你的鼻子和耳后。每个人鱼都有这些鳃，但如果你真的不想要这些，或者你只是想永远屏住呼吸而不用扩展肺，那就随你吧。除了普通的人鱼鳃外，你还可以在胸骨直接放置鳃，或者放在颈部两侧。记住，你需要确切地了解所有关于鳃的知识，它们在内部的工作原理等等。你需要知道你的肺在哪里/你的气管在哪里，并让这些鳃有地方从那里呼吸。现在我们有了肺。如果你愿意，你可以有一个大肺。但对一些人来说可能更难，因为你需要知道它在哪里，周围的器官如何工作等等。我个人更喜欢鳃，因为我觉得它们更容易转变，但是对于扩展肺。对于这一点，你必须改变你体内的结构，这样你就有一个大肺，但你需要时不时地上来呼吸更多的空气，因为这不是鳃，你不能永远待在水下。**~珊瑚塞里尼亚**'

    takes the most practice, but with a little effort you can do it. The hardest part
    about shifting is calling your mermaid form out. You can't have any doubt when
    doing this. Because if you do, the tail will not come out.

- en: The easiest way to accomplish P-shifting is to have the F-shift, and the M-shift
    down to a T. Meaning you have to know exactly what your shifting for. Having a
    clear image of your tail in your head always helps. Also, you may want to be wet
    when doing this, and be in a quiet space where nothing will bother you. Below
    I have listed many shifting methods you can use, all from different people, you
    can try each one out so you know which one works best for you. Physical shifting
    takes multiple tries, so don't get upset if it doesn't work the first time.

    物理转移需要多次尝试, 所以如果第一次不起作用, 不要感到沮丧.
- en: Method 1 is about visualization. First, get comfy and relaxed from head to toe.
    Remember not to wear pants, considering it stops the shifting process, and they
    may rip. So if you aren't comfortable being naked, wear a big shirt. You can also
    use candles, and music that reminds you of mermaids. My personal favorite is "Beyond
    the Sea" by Celtic Woman. Next, close your eyes and start focusing on your energy
    from the top of your head, to the tips of your toes. See in your head your fluke
    forming to your desire. At this point you may feel some pain at your feet, toes,
    and ankles. Keep visualizing the pain as your mermaid self becomes physically
    tangable, physically real. Visualize your mermaid self coming out of your body,
    and becoming real.  Do this SLOWLY and do not rush.

    你还可以使用蜡烛, 和那些提醒你的音乐的美人鱼. 我个人最喜欢的是凯尔特女人的“海的彼方”. 接下来, 闭上你的眼睛, 并开始集中你的能量从你的头顶, 到你的脚尖.
    在你的头脑中看到你的鲸鱼正在形成你的愿望. 在这一点上, 你可能会感到一些痛苦在你的脚, 脚趾, 和脚踝. 保持视觉化的痛苦, 因为你的美人鱼自我变得身体上可触摸,
    身体上真实. 在你的身体外面看到你的美人鱼自我出来, 并成为真实. 慢慢做这个, 不要着急.
