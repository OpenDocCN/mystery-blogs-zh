- en: Clairvoyance has been a part of many spiritual and religious practices throughout
    history. The term “clairvoyance” can be broken down into two parts. “Clair” is
    a French word meaning “clear” or “clear sight” and “voyance” is derived from the
    Latin word “visio” meaning “vision.” Together, these two words can be translated
    to mean “clear sight” or “clear seeing.”

  zh: 透视在历史上的许多精神和宗教实践中都占有一席之地。术语“透视”可以分解为两部分。“Clair”是法语，意思是“清晰”或“清晰视觉”，而“voyance”源自拉丁语“visio”，意思是“视觉”。这两个词结合起来可以翻译为“清晰视力”或“清晰视觉”。
- en: '**Clairvoyance**  *is about intuition and perception. The psychic ability to
    be able to use one''s inner senses to receive "images" or observe an inner pictorial
    language, in one''s own mind, related to questions or various in-sights.*'

- en: Sometimes people assume that Clairvoyance means they have to see things in front
    of themselves physically, in such detail and realism that they shouldn't even
    be able to tell the difference between their reality and their vision. The truth
    is, this is not the case for a majority of psychic clairvoyants. **Most visions
    are seen through the "mind's eye,**" in a similar manner like you would day dream
    or envision a scene from a movie.

  zh: 有时人们认为透视意味着他们必须在物理上看到自己面前的事物，如此详细和真实，以至于他们甚至无法区分现实和幻象。事实上，并非大多数灵媒透视者如此。**大多数幻象都是通过"心灵的眼睛"看到的**，就像你白天做梦或者想象电影场景一样。

    to know absolutely everything about a person and their previous incarnations,

    the subtleties in a person's life based on that person's character and how they

  zh: 但是利用所看到的东西，结合他们的直觉，有时候加上占卜，来推断可能发生的事件。这并不总是关于一个人能够完全了解一个人及其以前的化身的一切，然而，如果一个人的透视能力发展得很好，他们可能会更加意识到一个人生活中的微妙之处，这些微妙之处基于那个人的性格及其表现方式。
- en: In addition, it is important to understand that clairvoyance is not a form of
    fortune-telling. People who are clairvoyant do not have the ability to predict
    the future. Instead, they are able to gain insight into the present and past,
    as well as to gain understanding about the energies, entities, and other phenomena
    that exist around them.

  zh: 此外，了解透视不是一种占卜的形式是很重要的。有透视能力的人没有预测未来的能力。相反，他们能够洞察现在和过去，并理解存在于他们周围的能量、实体和其他现象。
- en: Therefore, the clairvoyant is simply **perceiving the energy that is made available
    to them**, in whatever way. Sometimes it can be very telling, other times a certain
    energy can even seem so pure that it appears as if it was intentionally being
    well disguised. The more practiced and developed one is with this faculty, and
    also the more pure one's character is, the better they'll be able to read things
    with the use of clairvoyance, which is **a**  **completely natural ability**.

- en: Through practice, one learns how to read situations and events even better,
    according to their own inner sight, and can make more and **more informed judgements**
    of the future based on the previous success that they've had, which they can continue

    to see things that are not visible to the naked eye. **It is not a magical ability
    or a form of fortune-telling, and it is not something that can be acquired overnight.**
    People who are clairvoyant are simply able to access information that is not available
    to the average person, and they are not able to control or manipulate others.
    Understanding the true nature of clairvoyance is essential to being able to use
    it responsibly.
