  zh: '*每年年初，许多人都在做出新年决心的决定，但是，通过这种看似神奇的行为，他们却没有意识到新年决心本身的原则。让我们来看看新年决心的显现力量。*'
- en: The New Year has this **monumental energy** that comes with it that helps people
    feel that they can overcome their resistance to whatever they want, yet this kind
    of feeling should continue to be cultivated long after the spell has worn off
    for most people.

  zh: 新年伴随着这种**庞大的能量**，帮助人们感到他们可以克服对任何他们想要的东西的抗拒，然而，这种感觉应该在大多数人的魔法效果消失后继续培养。

  zh: 人们可以顺利地乘上最初的浪潮，但他们需要有能力继续游泳，而不需要其他人的集体帮助。足够依靠自己。
- en: People tend to lack the initiative to do something without someone else doing
    it first. Thus, this initial burst leads to people clammering to start something
    like everyone else, at the same time, but whose effort wanes with the tide. You
    need to not be like those people, but to train yourself, to separate yourself
    from this way of dependently going along with things as if it could be a strategy
    that could work or get successful results on its own.

  zh: 人们往往缺乏在没有别人先行的情况下做某事的主动性。因此，这种初始爆发导致人们像其他人一样急于开始某事，但他们的努力随着潮汐而减弱。你不能像那些人一样，而是要训练自己，摆脱这种依赖性地跟随事物的方式，好像这本身就是一种可能有效或能带来成功结果的策略。

  zh: 你总是要超越集体所做的事情。否则，没有人会在其中看到与其他人的区别。
- en: You also want to be more independent and free from any other currents but your
    own desires, so you're not just going along with other people. Thus, the initial
    creative burst comes and you can ride with it like everyone else, not going against
    the current, but when people stagnate as they will or lose motivation, you need
    to maintain pursuing your desire well into its completion and beyond it.

  zh: 你也想更加独立，摆脱任何其他潮流，而不只是随波逐流。因此，最初的创造性爆发出现了，你可以像其他人一样顺其自然，不反其道而行，但当人们像他们会做的那样停滞不前或失去动力时，你需要继续追求你的愿望，直至完成并超越它。

  zh: 非常类似于新月。那个开始显现的时期，其性质是被创造性欲望填满，这种欲望会不断增长，直至满月或下一个满月，直到能够收获。
- en: And just as a lot of businesses don't succeed, neither will some people's manifestations
    if they don't carry them out, not only to their completion, but continue to build

  zh: 如果他们不去实现它们，那么很多企业都不会成功，就像一些人的显现一样，不仅仅是完成它们，而且要继续建设和扩展，甚至超越最初的概念，这些都是通过追求的经验所学到的。
- en: Let us contemplate these kinds of principles and use them to our advantage in
    the coming year ahead. To rise, not only with the collective tides, but to take
