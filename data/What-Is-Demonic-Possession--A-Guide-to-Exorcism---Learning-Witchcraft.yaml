    this guide will go over what you need in the event that it becomes a problem.

  zh: 驱魔术在女巫和异教徒圈子中并不常谈论。如果你在寻找信息，可能找不到。因此，本指南将讨论在这种情况下你需要的信息。
- en: To start, we will discuss possession. How does possession occur? Most believe
    that those who are involved in the occult have a higher chance of becoming possessed.
    This is because they have opened themselves up and also because they may intentionally
    call forth particular spirits. This statement has an element of truth in it, but
    it does not give the entire picture. People who are just starting out with the
    occult may be more likely to become possessed because they may not follow procedures
    the way that they should. In contrast, occultists and witches who have been doing
    this for a while are not likely to become possessed at all.

  zh: 首先，我们将讨论附身。附身是如何发生的？大多数人认为那些参与秘术的人更有可能被附身。这是因为他们已经敞开了自己，也因为他们可能会故意召唤特定的灵魂。这种说法有一定的真实性，但它并没有给出全部情况。刚开始接触秘术的人可能更容易被附身，因为他们可能没有按照应该的程序进行操作。相比之下，已经从事这项工作一段时间的秘术师和女巫根本不太可能被附身。
- en: There are a few other people that are more likely to become possessed than others.
    Those that use Ouija boards, for example, are vulnerable. In addition, people
    that go to cemeteries or other areas where there are a lot of spirits could become
    possessed. Some people are also more vulnerable to possession because they are
    young, their minds are not as strong or they simply have psychic powers that they
    have not tapped into yet.

  zh: 有一些其他人比其他人更有可能被附身。例如，那些使用唿灵板的人是脆弱的。此外，那些去墓地或其他有大量灵魂存在的地方的人也可能被附身。一些人更容易被附身，因为他们年轻，他们的思维不够坚强，或者他们简单地有他们尚未开发的心灵能力。

    Demons are usually involved, but ghosts may also possess a human as well.

  zh: 如果有人被附身，有几种方法可以分辨出来。通常牵涉到恶魔，但鬼魂也可能附身于人体。
- en: When demons are involved, they are trying to hurt the person or they are trying
    to hurt someone else. Demons may not be able to take over the human completely.
    This is because either the demon is not strong enough or because the victim is
    particularly strong. However, the longer a demon is allowed to remain in the body,
    the worse the situation because. The demon will try and separate the person’s
    body and their soul. Obviously, the result of this is death.

  zh: 当恶魔参与时，它们要么试图伤害这个人，要么试图伤害其他人。恶魔可能无法完全控制人类。这是因为恶魔要么不够强大，要么受害者特别坚强。然而，允许恶魔在身体内停留的时间越长，情况就越糟糕。恶魔将试图分离人的身体和灵魂。显然，结果是死亡。
- en: A demon typically does not leave the body on their own. They either have to
    be forced out or they will leave if they accomplish what they set out to do.

  zh: 恶魔通常不会自己离开身体。它们要么被迫离开，要么在完成他们的目标后离开。
- en: Some ghosts are unhappy and have something that they want to accomplish. As
    a result, they will possess the body to achieve their goals. Because a ghost was
    once a human, they have better skills when it comes to controlling the person.
    However, they do not have as much energy as demons, so their possession does not
    last as long and only works with those that are very vulnerable. Many times, the
    ghost only possesses the human for a couple of minutes.

  zh: 一些鬼魂不开心并且有一些事情想要完成。因此，它们会附身来达到他们的目标。由于鬼魂曾经是人类，他们在控制人体方面有更好的技能。然而，他们没有恶魔那么多的能量，所以他们的附身时间不会很长，而且只会作用于非常脆弱的人。许多时候，鬼魂只会附身几分钟。

    are often terrified. The human being possessed can lose consciousness. When they
    come to, they will not know what happened. If the possessed does try and rebel,
    they will realize what happened during the possession.

  zh: 附身并不经常发生，但一旦发生，周围的人往往会感到恐惧。被附身的人可能会失去意识。当他们苏醒过来时，他们将不知道发生了什么。如果被附身者试图反抗，他们会意识到附身期间发生了什么。
- en: The first sign of a possession is an extreme behavior change. For example, a
    normally passive person might become violent suddenly. They also may feel extreme
    pain or have an unexplained injury pop up.

  zh: 附身的第一个迹象是极端的行为改变。例如，一个通常温和的人可能会突然变得暴力。他们也可能感到极端的疼痛或出现无法解释的伤口。
- en: Sometimes, possession is very apparent. The person involved may be able to move
    things with their mind or set fire to something with their mind. Their appearance
    may be altered as well; for example, their eyes could go black. Finally, the person
    might have abnormal strength.
