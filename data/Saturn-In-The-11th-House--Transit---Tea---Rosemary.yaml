    pain, and uses discipline to change the way you view that area of life. Every

    lessons that you will need in order to move into the next phase of life.'

    you will experience lessons and transformations in every area of life until you

- en: The most obvious meaning to me about the 11th house refers to “the tribe.” In
    today’s society, it is very difficult to have a tribe, because it often requires
    a lot of choice in the matter. Saturn asks us who our tribe is, gives us options,
