  zh: 什么是异教？
- en: It’s difficult to claim that the main religious practice of the United States
    is not Christianity. Due to cultural inertia, even people who aren’t necessarily
    practicing Christians still hold some Christian beliefs, or at the very least
    will claim Christianity when asked. Even the people who are not Christian in the
    United States will often follow religions that are considered mainstream world
    religions. These are religions that have a central leadership authority, as well
    as main dogmatic books to learn from, such as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and other
    such religions.

  zh: 很难说美国的主要宗教实践不是基督教。由于文化的惯性，即使不一定是基督教信徒的人仍然持有一些基督教信仰，或者至少在被问及时会声称自己是基督徒。即使在美国不是基督徒的人也经常遵循被认为是主流世界宗教的宗教。这些是有中央领导权威以及主要教义书籍可供学习的宗教，如犹太教、伊斯兰教、印度教等宗教。
- en: A religion that does not get talked about very often, or when it does it’s talked
    about incorrectly or confusingly, is paganism. This is in large part because paganism
    is difficult to quantify specifically. It can cover a wide range of different
    spiritual beliefs and practices, many of which have their own distinct history.
    Because of this, it can be difficult for a person who doesn’t know anything about
    paganism to really learn a basic understanding of the faith.

  zh: 一个很少被谈论的宗教，或者当谈论它时，往往是错误或令人困惑的，就是异教。这在很大程度上是因为异教很难具体量化。它涵盖了各种不同的精神信仰和实践，其中许多都有自己独特的历史。因此，对于一个对异教一无所知的人来说，要真正学习基本的信仰理解是很困难的。

- en: The dictionary definition of a pagan is a person who holds a religious belief
    other than mainstream world religions. This is more or less correct, but is much
    like saying that the Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, is just some
    random Catholic person.

  zh: 一个异教徒的词典定义是一个持有非主流世界宗教信仰的人。这基本上是正确的，但这就好像说罗马天主教会的首领教皇只是一个普通的天主教徒一样。
- en: In general, pagan is used as an umbrella term for a number of religious beliefs
    that stem from old world tribal religions. Or at least, old world tribal religions
    that are not Judeo-Christian in origin. In other words, the religious beliefs
    of people who were brought into the Christian church over time as the Church spread
    across the continent.

  zh: 一般来说，异教被用作一种涵盖许多源自旧世界部落宗教的宗教信仰的总称。或者至少，源自非犹太基督教的旧世界部落宗教。换句话说，这些是在基督教传播到大陆时被引入教会的人们的宗教信仰。
- en: This means that there are a number of spiritual beliefs that can fall under
    the pagan umbrella. In practical terms, this means that if you want to talk about
    pagan spiritual beliefs you generally need to specify which spiritual belief you’re
    going to be talking about. A Wiccan, for example, might hold a similar spiritual
    beliefs to someone who claims to be a Druid but they will not be the same spiritual
    beliefs nor will they have the same religious practices.

  zh: 这意味着有许多精神信仰可以归为异教的范畴。在实际操作中，这意味着如果你想谈论异教的精神信仰，通常需要明确你将要谈论的是哪种精神信仰。例如，一个女巫可能持有与自称是德鲁伊的人类似的精神信仰，但他们的精神信仰不会完全相同，也不会有相同的宗教实践。

- en: The other thing that makes paganism difficult to quantify is that since there
    is no central pagan authority that exists to state what is and is not pagan, nearly
    anybody can claim to be pagan. in addition, many people have some amount of religious
    belief or religious practice that could be considered pagan, but they don’t consider
    themselves pagan.[fsbProduct asin=’1573539031′ size=’300′ align=’right’]

  zh: 使异教难以量化的另一件事是，由于不存在中央异教权威来规定什么是异教和什么不是异教，几乎任何人都可以声称自己是异教徒。此外，许多人拥有一定程度的宗教信仰或宗教实践，可能被视为异教，但他们并不认为自己是异教徒。
- en: As a great example, it’s well known that the Catholic church incorporated a
    number of local gods as the church grew and spread through Europe. They didn’t
    call them Gods, since obviously as far as the Catholic church was concerned they
    were not. Instead, they made these Gods into Saints. Catholic dogma allows for
    a devoted Catholic to pray to the Saints, not as Gods but rather as trusted and
    devoted servants of the one true God. The idea is that since these trusted and
    devoted servants of the one true God were given a higher station through their
    acts upon the Earth, they can help people still on Earth accomplish their task.
    So many different Catholic practices that involve praying to or seeking the aid
    of a saint have their roots in pagan traditions.

  zh: 作为一个很好的例子，众所周知，随着天主教会在欧洲的发展和传播，它吸收了许多当地的神祇。他们并不称他们为神，因为在天主教会看来，他们显然不是。相反，他们将这些神祇变成了圣人。天主教教义允许虔诚的天主教徒向圣人祈祷，不是作为神，而是作为真神的忠实和虔诚的仆人。这个想法是，由于这些真神的忠实和虔诚的仆人通过他们在地球上的行为获得了更高的地位，他们可以帮助仍在地球上的人完成他们的任务。因此，许多涉及向圣人祈祷或寻求帮助的天主教实践都源于异教传统。
- en: There are a few major religions under the pagan umbrella. For example, Wicca
    is a pagan religion that has a founding authority, sort of. Much of modern Wicca
    comes from what is referred to as Gardnarian tradition. In 1954 a man named Gerald
    Gardner published a book entitled Witchcraft Today. In it, he wrote what he claimed
    was information he got from meeting witches who followed ancient traditional practices.

  zh: 在异教伞下有几个主要宗教。例如，女巫教是一种有一定创始权威的异教宗教。现代女巫教的很多内容来自所谓的加德纳传统。1954年，一个名叫杰拉尔德·加德纳的人出版了一本名为《今日巫术》的书。在书中，他写下了他声称是从遇见遵循古老传统实践的女巫那里得到的信息。
- en: This was almost certainly false. However, it’s also false to claim he made all
    of it up. He certainly took quite a bit of inspiration from the pagan spiritual
    practices of the time, as well as influences from Victorian era occultism, and
    many other pagan spiritual practices from throughout history. Not only that, but
    several branches of modern Wicca have branched from Gardnerian Tradition, and
    have come from other traditions that evolves alongside Gardnerian Tradition.

  zh: 这几乎可以肯定是错误的。然而，声称他完全是凭空捏造也是错误的。他确实从当时的异教精神实践中汲取了相当多的灵感，以及维多利亚时代的神秘主义影响，以及历史上许多其他异教精神实践的影响。不仅如此，现代女巫教的几个分支都源自加德纳传统，并且来自与加德纳传统并行发展的其他传统。
- en: Ultimately, the answer to what is a pagan is who is calling themselves pagan.
    Since pagan covers so many different spiritual practices, it’s difficult to claim
    that someone is or is not paid. In general, you can presume that if something
    comes up from spiritual practices other than a mainstream religion, or from a
    major spiritual belief of people in centuries past that are no longer followed,
    then you can presume it is pagan. So the correct question isn’t “**what is a pagan**“,
    but rather, “is this spiritual belief pagan”.

  zh: 最终，对于什么是异教的答案在于谁自称为异教徒。由于异教涵盖了许多不同的精神实践，很难断言某人是或不是异教徒。一般来说，如果某种精神实践不是来自主流宗教，或者来自于过去几个世纪中不再遵循的主要精神信仰，那么你可以认为它是异教。因此，正确的问题不是“**什么是异教**”，而是“这种精神信仰是不是异教”。
