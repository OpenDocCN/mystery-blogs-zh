- en: If the first thing that comes to mind when you read the term “sorcery” is a
    stylized mouse and an accidental army of anthropomorphic broomsticks, you are
    not alone. For the most part, the term has fallen out of favor in the pagan/witch
    community, if it was ever even popular to begin with.

  zh: 如果当你读到“巫术”这个词时，脑海中首先浮现的是一个风格化的老鼠和一支意外形象化的扫帚军团，那么你并不孤单。在很大程度上，如果起初这个词并不流行，它已经不再受到异教/女巫社区的青睐。
- en: The question of why that is true is harder to answer, but we can gain clues
    by looking at the large mouse and other sources such as dictionary and encyclopedias
    published before Wicca and Paganism became better known in mainstream culture.

  zh: 关于为什么这是真的的问题更难回答，但我们可以通过查看大鼠和其他来源（例如在Wicca和Paganism在主流文化中变得更为人知之前出版的词典和百科全书）来获得线索。
- en: Sorcery is commonly defined as the practice of magic, specifically magic of
    an evil intent. Practitioners are called sorcerers, sorceresses, or wizards, but
    rarely is the term “witch” associated with sorcery. Additionally, the term is
    for the most part considered agnostic having no strong ties to any particular
    religion. It is a practice with hidden knowledge and facts at its heart.

  zh: 巫术通常被定义为魔法的实践，特别是带有邪恶意图的魔法。从业者被称为巫师、女巫或巫术师，但是很少有人将“女巫”一词与巫术联系起来。此外，该术语在很大程度上被认为是不可知论的，没有与任何特定宗教的强烈联系。它是一种以隐藏知识和事实为核心的实践。
- en: Meanwhile, the definition of witchcraft, before Gerald Gardner changed it’s
    meaning with the introduction of Wicca, was associated with devil worship. The
    traditional representations of witches we have from documents of the actual witch
    trials that swept through Europe and plays about witch trials in the Americas
    carry the same theme of a woman or man that has sworn a pack with the devil. This
    relationship is the key to what gives the “witches” of that period their powers.

  zh: 与此同时，在杰拉尔德·加德纳通过引入Wicca改变其意义之前，女巫术的定义与恶魔崇拜有关。我们从欧洲席卷而过的实际女巫审判的文件和美洲女巫审判戏剧中得到的传统女巫的表现都带有与魔鬼立约的主题。这种关系是那个时期“女巫”的力量所在。
    [fsbProduct asin=’0738714259′ size=’300′ align=’right’]
- en: While no one today puts much stock into the accusations or differentiation’s
    from hundreds of years ago, the theme of worship is still associated with witchcraft
    in a way that it is not in sorcery. In this manner, sorcery is more like alchemy,
    an abandoned early science and kin to modern other fields such as the chemistry.
    Sorcery is rarely connected with a specific religious practice and therefore could
    be performed without any belief structure to support it. Additionally, the reliance
    on knowledge speaks to implications of it being performed only by the well-educated.

  zh: 虽然今天没有人再对几百年前的指控或区分抱有太多期望，但崇拜的主题仍然与女巫craft有关，而在巫术中却没有。在这方面，巫术更像炼金术，一种被放弃的早期科学，与现代化学等其他领域有关。巫术很少与特定的宗教实践联系在一起，因此可以在没有任何支持结构的信仰下进行。此外，对知识的依赖表明它只能由受过良好教育的人来执行。
- en: 'Witches, while they come in all shapes, sizes, and religions (even Christianity),
    still have a strong tie to spiritualism and relationships with the unseen. Often
    times, they draw their power from an external, typically spiritual sources, whether
    that be ancestors, Gods and Goddesses, the earth, spirit animals, etc. They set
    up altars as places of worship and practice their crafts and set out offerings
    to further reinforce their spiritual bonds. They are also traditionally associated
    with the “low” people: individuals who didn’t have the wealth needed to have the
    time for higher education or expensive books, having to rely on superstition over
    science. Even atheist witches share the relationship and spiritualism attribute.
    In their case, they build a bond with their higher spiritual selves – a source
    outside their immediate consciousness – to make their magic work.'

  zh: 巫师们，无论形状、大小和宗教信仰（甚至包括基督教），仍然与灵性和与看不见的世界的关系紧密相连。通常情况下，他们从外部（通常是灵性的来源）获取力量，无论是祖先、神灵、女神、地球、灵性动物等等。他们建立祭坛作为崇拜的场所，并实践他们的技艺，布置祭品以进一步加强他们的灵性联系。他们也传统上与“低层”人群联系紧密：那些由于没有财富去花时间接受高等教育或购买昂贵书籍，而必须依赖迷信而非科学的个体。即使是无神论的巫师也分享了与灵性和灵性主义的关系属性。在他们的情况下，他们与他们的更高灵性自我建立联系——这是在他们直接意识之外的一种来源——以使他们的魔法生效。
- en: 'Meanwhile, the mouse and other sorcerers work from hidden knowledge of a specific,
    almost scientific process. The mouse, for example, was nothing without the stolen
    hat. The fact that the mouse was able to create magic without real skill also
    suggests the more scientific nature of sorcery: if you follow the formula and
    have the right tools, it works (to an extent) no matter what your skill.'

  zh: 与此同时，鼠和其他巫师们则从特定、几乎是科学的过程中的隐藏知识中工作。例如，鼠在没有偷来的帽子之前什么都不是。鼠能够在没有真正技能的情况下制造魔法，这也暗示了巫术更具科学性质的一面：如果你遵循公式并拥有正确的工具，它会（在一定程度上）起作用，无论你的技能如何。
- en: As a practitioner of witchcraft, I often think of sorcery as “Magic without
    soul,” though it’s far from an unbiased opinion. People today can still practice
    sorcery with the right resources. Its usefulness and authenticity as anything
    other than a disproven science are up to the individual to determine. For witches,
    witchcraft serves a dual purpose as a way to enact change to the world around
    the practitioner and a source of faith to enrich their spirit.

  zh: 作为巫术实践者，我经常将巫术视为“无灵魂的魔法”，尽管这远非一个无偏见的观点。今天的人们仍然可以通过正确的资源来实践巫术。其实用性和真实性不仅仅是一种已被证明为假的科学，而是由个人来决定。对于巫师们来说，巫术具有双重目的：一方面是改变周围世界的手段，另一方面是丰富他们的灵魂的信仰来源。
