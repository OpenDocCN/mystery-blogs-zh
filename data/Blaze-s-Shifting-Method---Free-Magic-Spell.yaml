    include not only rapid shift, but my general concept of long term shifting. If
    you know an animal form eligible for the rapid shift, then substitute the word
    "wolf" with "_whatever your animal is_"

- en: There are 2 classes of shift, M and P. As you might already know, M-shift is
    Mental shift, and P-shift is Physical shift. The M-shift is where you induce instinct,
    thought pattern, and the base around which the P-shift is built. The P-shift is
    the actual change of the form of the body. There are 3 different subclasses of
    P-shift. They are Practice, On-Spot, and Long-Term. Before any of these, you must
    achieve an M-shift, and then, the first subclasses available are practice and
    long term. After practice, comes On-Spot, which is the true mastery of the P-shift.
    Long term is not a mastery, but a commitment. If you long term shift, you will
    never again be human, and once you have unlocked it, there is not turning back.
    Now that I have covered the basics, we are ready to proceed to the instructions,
    starting with the M-shift.

  zh: 有2类转变，M和P。也许你已经知道，M-shift是心理转变，而P-shift是身体转变。M-shift是你引发本能、思维模式和P-shift构建的基础。P-shift是身体形态的实际改变。P-shift有3个不同的子类。它们是Practice、On-Spot和Long-Term。在这些之前，你必须先实现M-shift，然后，可用的第一个子类是practice和long
    term。在练习之后，出现On-Spot，这是P-shift的真正掌握。长期不是一种掌握，而是一种承诺。如果你长期转变，你将再也不会是人类，一旦你解锁了它，就再也无法回头。现在我已经介绍了基础知识，我们准备继续进行说明，从M-shift开始。

- en: 'To M-Shift, there is a thing I like to call the 3IA of M-Shifting. Inspiration,
    Investigation, Imagination, Application. Those are all the steps to a successful
    M-Shift. Inspiration: You need to inspire yourself. Keep some pictures or other
    representation of a wolf nearby or with you at all times, and try to keep yourself
    thinking of wolves nonstop. At around the same time, you need to Investigate.
    Investigation: You need to find as much information about wolves as you can, and
    quiz yourself. Make yourself as much of a wolf expert as you can. After you are
    an "expert" you need to use all that knowledge you gathered and imagine it. Imagination:
    You need to draw on the behavior, minds, and instincts of wolves, and simply imagine
    yourself (to the point that you believe it) as a wolf, but not physically, mentally.
    Continue doing this until you are not only a wolf enthusiast and expert, but also
    a wolf at mind, so much that you feel that you are one at points, this means that
    the wolf side has taken over your mind. This is not a switch on and off thing.
    The M-shift is permanent, but it can be controlled so that you can fit in in human
    society. Once you M-shift, your mind is set on a permanent course becoming a wolf
    mind. It is irreversible, and can be set off involuntarily. This will definitely
    change you forever.'

  zh: 对于M-Shift，有一件事我称之为M-Shift的3IA。灵感、调查、想象、应用。这些都是成功进行M-Shift的步骤。灵感：你需要激励自己。无论何时何地，保持一些狼的图片或其他代表物品，并试图不停地想着狼。大致在同一时间，你需要进行调查。调查：你需要尽可能多地收集关于狼的信息，并对自己进行问询。让自己成为尽可能多的狼专家。在你成为“专家”之后，你需要利用你收集的所有知识进行想象。想象：你需要参考狼的行为、心灵和本能，并简单地想象自己（甚至相信）成为一只狼，但不是在身体上，而是在精神上。继续这样做，直到你不仅是一位狼爱好者和专家，而且在精神上是一只狼，以至于在某些时刻你觉得你自己就是一只狼，这意味着狼的一面已经占据了你的精神。这不是一种可以随意开关的事情。M-Shift是永久的，但它可以被控制，以便你可以适应人类社会。一旦你进行了M-Shift，你的思维就开始永久地成为狼的思维。这是不可逆转的，也可能是不经意地开启的。这将永远改变你。
- en: The next stage I will talk about is the Practice P-Shift stage. The alternate
    stage that opts-in here is the Long-Term Shift, which is 2 paragraphs down. The
    starting point of the practice P-shift is completion of the M-shift. Once that
    is complete, you must once again draw on the expert knowledge that you obtained
    in the Investigation part of the M-shift. You need to be able to picture the physical
    aspects of a wolf, AS MUCH AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET, and bring it to mind again.
    You must then use the skill gained in the Imagination part of the M-shift. You
    need to first fire up that wolf mind and relieve all restraints and "release your
    inner wolf" in a sanctuary (somewhere that you can be alone, relaxed, and free
    of all distractions.) Then you need to get relaxed as deeply as possible, and
    gather as much focus as you can on what it would look like and feel like to be
    a wolf for a second, now, fire up that wolf mind all the way until you feel you
    are a wolf again. Now, imagine your human body as "what I would look like IF I
    was a human" and work from that, and how it would feel as a human, and what it
    would look like, then work on to what it would feel and look like to shift into
    a wolf. Imagine it as VIVIDLY as possible using all senses. Keep practicing, it
    might not work the first time, I also recommend focusing on one body part at a
    time as you practice it, because you will get individual parts easier. Eyes, teeth,
    ears, paws, those are the easiest few. The tail comes in just after these. Work
    towards your end goal with PATIENCE. If you are impatient, you will not get any
    results. Usually a full shift takes 2 weeks to 4 months to achieve. It depends
    on the concentration of wolf blood in you, the more you practice, the more concentrated
    it becomes. You definitely don't want 100% though (that only happens after PNR,
    and 3rd degree possession). Once you achieve a shift, I call the point at which
    you shift, the barrier. The barrier is also called the "sneeze" by some, because
    the nature of the barrier is exactly like a sneeze. It begins with a strange sensation
    that rushes across you, and becomes a burst that you cannot control. When you
    reach it, you will feel a sensation like a cozy warm feeling, then a feeling of
    energy surging through you (not painful), that soon becomes a feeling of clenching
    and flexing all over your body, and a strange feeling that everything your body
    is made of is changing. During this, your body involuntarily moved as if you are
    being controlled, and it leaves you helpless to control your own body, this barrier
    lasts anywhere between 5 and 50 seconds. It is important that once you reach the
    barrier, you do not panic, or you will terminate the shift, and nothing will happen.
    You need to just be relaxed as a rock and let the shift take it's course. Once
    you do, you will become a wolf. So at this point it is important to know how to
    shift back. In the first few shifts, falling asleep is usually enough to end it,
    but if you aren't tired, remember that staying a wolf on the first few shifts
    for longer than an hour can result in PNR passing, and being "stuck" forever.
    So the other method is to P-shift back, imagine yourself returning, you might
    need to use more strength and focus the longer you stay. Be aware of that. It
    is a more simple reverse method of P-shifting to turn yourself back.

  zh: 下一个阶段我将讨论的是练习 P-Shift 阶段。在这里选择的备选阶段是长期转变，它在 2 段落之后。练习 P-shift 的起点是完成 M-shift。一旦完成，你必须再次利用在
    M-shift 的调查部分获得的专家知识。你需要能够尽可能多地想象一只狼的物理特征，并再次浮现在脑海中。然后你必须使用在 M-shift 的想象部分获得的技能。你需要首先激活那只狼的思维，并解除所有约束，"释放你内心的狼"
    在一个庇护所（一个你可以独自、轻松和没有任何干扰的地方。）然后你需要尽可能深地放松，并集中尽可能多的注意力在一秒钟内成为狼的样子和感觉上，现在，全神贯注地激活那只狼的思维，直到你再次感觉自己是一只狼。现在，想象你的人体是"如果我是一个人会是什么样子"并从那里开始工作，以及作为一个人会感觉如何，会是什么样子，然后继续想象如何感觉和看起来变成一只狼。尽可能生动地想象，利用所有感官。继续练习，第一次可能不会成功，我也建议你在练习时一次只专注于一个身体部位，因为你会更容易掌握单个部位。眼睛、牙齿、耳朵、爪子，这些是最容易的几个部位。尾巴紧随其后。要有耐心地朝着最终目标努力。如果你心急，你将得不到任何结果。通常一个完整的转变需要
    2 周到 4 个月的时间。这取决于你体内的狼血浓度，你练习得越多，浓度就会越高。但你绝对不希望达到 100%（这只有在 PNR 和三级占有之后才会发生）。一旦你完成了一个转变，我称之为你转变的点，也称为障碍。这个障碍有些人也称为
    "打喷嚏"，因为障碍的性质正如打喷嚏一样。它开始于一种奇怪的感觉，迅速地从你身上扩散开来，变成一个你无法控制的爆发。当你到达它时，你会感到一种舒适温暖的感觉，然后是一种能量涌入你身体的感觉（不痛苦），很快就会变成你全身收紧和屈伸的感觉，以及一种你身体的一切都在改变的奇怪感觉。在此期间，你的身体会不由自主地移动，就好像你被控制了一样，这会让你无法控制自己的身体，这个障碍持续的时间在
    5 到 50 秒之间。一旦你到达障碍，重要的是你不要惊慌，否则你会终止转变，什么也不会发生。你只需要像一块石头一样放松下来，让转变顺其自然。一旦你这样做了，你就会成为一只狼。所以在这一点上，重要的是要知道如何转变回来。在最初的几次转变中，入睡通常足以结束它，但如果你不困，记住，如果你在第一次转变后以狼的形态停留超过一个小时，可能会发生
    PNR 通过，并且永远"困"住你。所以另一种方法是 P-shift 返回，想象自己回来，你可能需要在停留的时间越长时使用更多的力量和注意力。要意识到这一点。这是一个更简单的逆转的方法，可以将自己变回来。
- en: After the Practice shift, you are ready to work on the On-Spot P-Shift. Take
    note that this one is the one with the highest danger factor for those with possession.
    In this one, you just need to practice fully flaring your m-shift, and focusing
    hard enough to induce a full shift while you are not in controlled circumstances.
    Best methods of training involve doing this while standing up. Practice avoiding
    distractions, flaring your focus, flaring your M-shift, and quickly P-shifting.
    It is important to emphasize focus, and dropping your humanity to the point you
    know you are a wolf on a moments notice. String everything together and practice
    to P-shift on a moments notice in a distracting and stressful environment. That
    is the On-Spot shift.

  zh: 完成Pratice shift后，你准备进行即时P-shift 的训练。 请注意，在这种情况下，对于那些已经占有的人来说，这是危险系数最高的训练。 在这种情况下，你只需要练习完全发动你的M-shift，并集中足够的注意力诱导出完全的转变，而你不处于受控的情况下。
    最好的训练方法包括在站立时进行。 练习避免分心，发动你的注意力，发动你的M-shift，并迅速进行P-shift。 强调注意力，并将你的人性降到你知道自己在某一刻是一只狼的程度。
    把一切串在一起，并练习在一个多么令人分心和紧张的环境中，在一个瞬间进行P-shift。 那就是即时转变。
- en: '***This is long term shifting, it is the shift that you can never return to
    human form, which you can use to become almost any animal, it is not recommended.
    DO NOT EVER ATTEMPT UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO GIVE UP YOUR ENTIRE HUMAN LIFE FOREVER.
    Now that you have been warned, this is just a concept, I cannot guarantee it works,
    because anybody who used it is no longer a human. The data I compiled is well
    passed in archives. It is not a common one, but under study, I find that it could
    work if performed properly. The Long-Term shift is long term in 2 ways. It lasts
    until you die, and it takes a relatively long time to be complete. First, you
    need to have some form of that animal''s genes in you somewhere, and they must
    be in an active cell. You just repeat the actions in the M-shift, and Practice
    P-shift, but in the practice P-shift, you must focus day after day, and expect
    very tiny results. Eventually it will set you on a frictionless course to permanently
    becoming that animal. This one can work for animals of different masses, because
    the time frame allows you to gain or lose significant amounts of mass. This one
    is absolutely irreversible and inevitably results in possession.'

  zh: 这是长期转变，这是一种你永远无法回到人类形态的变化，你可以利用它变成几乎任何动物，但不建议这样做。 除非你准备永远放弃你整个人类生活，否则绝对不要尝试。
    现在你已经收到警告了，这只是一个概念，我不能保证它有效，因为任何使用它的人现在都不再是人类。 我编制的数据已经存入档案。 这不是常见的方法，但在研究中，我发现如果正确执行，它是可行的。
    长期变形在两个方面是长期的。 它持续到你死去，而且需要相对长的时间才能完成。 首先，你需要在某个地方拥有某种动物的基因，并且它们必须在活跃的细胞中。 你只需重复M-shift中的动作，和Pratice
    P-shift中的练习，但在Pratice P-shift中，你必须日复一日地专注，并期望非常微小的结果。 最终，它会使你永久地成为那种动物，这会令你走上无摩擦的道路。
    这种方法适用于不同质量的动物，因为时限允许你获得或失去大量质量。 这是绝对不可逆转的，必然导致占有。
