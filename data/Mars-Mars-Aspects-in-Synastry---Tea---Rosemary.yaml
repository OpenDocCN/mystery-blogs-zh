- en: This depends entirely on the sign it happens in. When Mars conjunct Mars Synastry
    aspect happens in a fire sign, like Leo, Aries, or Sagittarius, this may produce
    explosive fights that lead to disaster. Because both partners have their mars

- en: However, if it happens in a softer sign like Taurus, Cancer, or Libra, (detriment
    and fall placements of mars) this could lead to a buildup of emotions and resentment.

    have something else in their chart, like moon, to balance each other out. It is
