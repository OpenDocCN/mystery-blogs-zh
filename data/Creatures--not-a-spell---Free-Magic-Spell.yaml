    it is really hard too believe in these people exsisting, but yet they do. It's
    a sad tale of these. A story involving two who should not be named, a good inventor
    and a bad inventor, both geniuses. The good one had lost so much wishing he could
    bring back his dead, while the bad was in a constant search for immortality. They
    paired together too build mechanisms giving bodys too the dead. But through there
    experements there was more loss, as the bad inventor saught murder too obtain
    fresh souls, the bad inventor decided that a young soul would be easier too manipulate
    when the clockwork came too life, tormenting and breaking the young too use there
    souls and bring up an obedient army, while the good inventor strived too free
    the children stuck in the clockwork. And now,  all the clockwork people wish for
    is too be free. Or they have become too broken in their mind too want anything
    but too stop the pain by serving the bad inventor. When you see one it will be
    obvious, but they are good at hiding away from the world. If you are one i am
    sorry that this is your fate. But this is another one that you will know if you
    are one. For needs, well they are clockwork after all, so repairs are needed when
    they are damaged. As for power once again they are clockwork, though some are
    merely but a soul pretending too be one as they were killed without a proper vessel.
    The ones who are but a soul are stronger than those who are not. This is more
    of a tragity than a race of those who are more capable of helping.

  zh: 活着的钟表：如果我告诉任何人确切的名字，我会被认为是妄想狂，很难相信这些人的存在，但他们确实存在。这是一个关于他们的悲伤故事。一个涉及到两个不应被提及的人，一个好发明家和一个坏发明家，两个都是天才。好人失去了太多，希望能把死者带回来，而坏人则不断寻找永生。他们合作建造机械给予死者身体。但通过他们的实验，损失更大，因为坏发明家为了得到新鲜的灵魂而寻求谋杀，坏发明家决定当钟表活过来时，折磨和摧毁年轻人，以使用他们的灵魂并组建一个顺从的军队，而好发明家则努力释放被困在钟表中的孩子。现在，所有的钟表人都希望自由。或者他们已经在心灵上变得太受伤了，不想要任何东西，只想通过为坏发明家服务来停止痛苦。当你看到一个时，这是显而易见的，但他们擅长隐藏自己远离世界。如果你是其中之一，我很抱歉这是你的命运。但这是另一个你会知道自己是否是其中之一的情况。至于需要，好吧，它们毕竟是钟表，所以当它们受损时需要修理。至于力量，再次，它们是钟表，尽管有些只是一个灵魂假装成一个，因为它们没有合适的容器而被杀死。只是一个灵魂的人比那些不是的人更强大。这更像是一种悲剧，而不是一种能够帮助更多的人的种族。

    they are kind at heart and deeply loyal too each other, they serve one main purpose,
    they hide what they think needs too be hidden. They are mysterious in there ways
    and power but they are each individually strong. These also thrive off of fear
    and usually feed off of those who are in between the dream plane and the first
    plane of each universe. The "sleep paralisis demon" is nothing more than a shadow
    feeding off fear. There are a lot of things that like too pretend they are shadows
    but too know a shadow as a shadow you must know there looks. They look like a
    dark spot, darker than a normally cast shadow. They also have two white eyes most
    of the time. There are also those who have red eyes, but id advise avoiding the
    red eyed shadows at all costs, as the ones with red eyes usually have malicious
    intent twords something that you'd better hope is not you. There are also a lot
    of things that pretend too be a shadow, being just a black blob is a really good
    way too hide what you really are. If you are a shadow or are pretending too be
    one, once more it's hard too miss.

  zh: 阴影：这些有趣的个体知之甚少，他们心地善良，深情而忠诚于彼此，他们有一个主要目的，那就是隐藏他们认为需要隐藏的东西。他们的方式和力量都是神秘的，但他们每个人都很强大。它们还靠恐惧生存，并且通常以介于梦境平面和每个宇宙的第一平面之间的人为食。"睡眠麻痹恶魔"只不过是一个以恐惧为食的阴影。有很多东西喜欢假装自己是阴影，但要了解一个阴影是什么，你必须知道它们的外表。它们看起来像一个黑暗的斑点，比通常的阴影更暗。它们通常有两只白眼睛。也有一些人有红眼睛，但我建议不惜一切代价避开红眼睛的阴影，因为那些有红眼睛的通常对某些你最好希望不是你的东西有恶意。还有很多东西假装成阴影，只是一个黑色的斑点是一个非常好的方式来隐藏你真正的身份。如果你是一个阴影或者假装成一个阴影，那么很难被错过。

    life essence and power through your blood. Thankfully most if not all were killed
    while creatures were still being hunted before they started needing too hide.
    "Vampiric" and "cannibalistic" entities thrive and can only survive off of certain
    things humans have in there blood and body. Essentially needing too eat humans
    like humans need too eat iron or protein. As i said before all vampires are at
    this point dead, but not all of the canibles are dead. Instead it's treated like
    a desise and there is a charity fund for these rare-ish conditions, and now instead
    of eating people they just get a shot in the arm every once and a while.

    obey the man that is sin but do not realise he is the one who coordinates this,
    instead giving Lucifer the blame. He is the plague that is in our world and is
    a devastating threat if his servants lead him too doing the impossible and winning
    a fight he can't win with the king of the gods. The war is already over because
    even with every human soul in all universes the man that is sin will never become
    strong enough too defeat the king of the gods. Does not mean he won't try. Because
    of this it's best the info is out there. So people know that there is a threat
    but it's not the creatures most of the time.

  zh: 至于那个代表罪恶的男人。他是个长相丑陋、皮肤漆黑、身穿沾满酒精饮料的袍子、头发混乱肮脏的家伙。他负责那些意外发生的恶念，但我们要负责选择不去实施那些黑暗的想法。恶魔听命于那个代表罪恶的男人，但并不知道他是协调者，他们还是将责任归咎于路西法。他是我世界的瘟疫，如果他的仆人们指导他去做那些不可能实现的事情并赢得与众神国王的战斗将是极其严重的威胁。战争已经结束，因为即使在所有宇宙中每个人的灵魂都在，代表罪恶的男人也永远不会变得足够强大去打败众神国王。但这并不意味他不会尝试。正因如此最好让这些信息公之于众。这样人们就知道有一种威胁，但大多数时候并不是那些生物。
- en: I've spent a good few hours now writing down part of what i know while being
    careful not too leak bad information, im glad too receive any input through comments,
    hopefully better understanding of what certain things are can help people understand
    these things, possibly even be less afraid.
