    Dutch. This practice focuses nearly wholly on healing and other connected human
    needs like protection. They also use true seeing and a little luck magic for good

- en: The Pennsylvania Dutch established settlements in the eighteenth century. Historians
    believe, however, that this magical tradition has roots reaching back to much
    earlier practices in Germany. Generally speaking everyone in a community knew
    who the Hex Masters were. There wasn’t something discussed in “polite” company
    because there were negative attitudes toward folk magic. The Pow-Wow Witch learned
    his or her art from their family or elders through oral tradition.

  zh: 十八世纪，宾夕法尼亚德国人建立了定居点。然而，历史学家认为，这一魔法传统根源可追溯到德国更早的实践。总体而言，社区中的每个人都知道Hex大师是谁。这不是“有礼貌”的话题，因为民间魔法受到了负面态度的影响。Pow-Wow
    Witch通过口头传统从家族或长辈那里学习他们的艺术。
- en: If you drive through Pennsylvania, you might see a star on a barn or vivid birds.
    These are remnants from Pow-Wow magic meant to protect the home, often from illness.
    Most villages had a healer who used roots and herbs in remedies. While the recipes
    for health had strong folk magic links, there was also a lot of knowledge possessed
    by these people. Even modern medicine has found many recommended herbs successful.

- en: The name for Pow-Wowing is “braucherei.” You could sometimes find tidbits of
    Pow Wow magic among the Mennonites and Amish communities. There were also quiet
    Pow Wow practices in the Lutheran Church. This link to Christianity, among others,

- en: Also called water witching and dowsing, the water witch walks in straight lines
    carrying a Y shaped branch. The prevalent tree types chosen for dowsing are Willow
    and Hazel. If the rod dipped or twitched, that’s where they would dig in hopes
    of creating a well. While this may sound like a silly methodology, there was enough
    interest in water witching that the US Geology Department did studies on it in
    the early 1900s.

    island of illness. PowWow has community ties. The successful PowWow group knows
    the abilities of each person and how to utilize them, producing a greater good,
    by the will of God. For modern Wiccans and Witches, the reliance on the Bible
    can be a huge obstacle if they find this craft interesting. Without the Bible,
    there is no PowWow framework. Keeping with tradition matters greatly to the PowWow
