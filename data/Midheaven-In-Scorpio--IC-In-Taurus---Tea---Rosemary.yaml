- en: The Midheaven (MC) and the Imum coeli (IC) are two opposite points in astrology
    that are calculated based on your place and time of birth. The IC shows the qualities
    that you learned in childhood and the environment that you wanted to escape.

  zh: 天顶（MC）和天底（IC）是根据你出生的地点和时间计算的两个相对点。天底显示了你在童年中学到的特质和你想要逃避的环境。
- en: In order to get away from the values of the IC, you push towards the Midheaven.
    In fact, the Midheaven is how people tend to perceive you in the outer world,
    but more specifically in your career. Although you may embrace the qualities of
    your Midheaven, the IC always exists underneath.

  zh: 为了摆脱天底的价值观，你朝向天顶推进。事实上，天顶是人们在外部世界中如何倾向于看待你的，尤其是在你的职业生涯中。虽然你可能接受了你的天顶的特质，但天底始终存在于内心深处。

    childhood. As an adult with Midheaven in Scorpio, you seek to individuate and
