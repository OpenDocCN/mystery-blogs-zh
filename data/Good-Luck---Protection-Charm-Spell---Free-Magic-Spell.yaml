- en: There you go! now you have a good luck charm. Please let me know how it worked
    for you guys. I have done it a couple of times now and it has worked very well
    every time. Though when you do notice the luck not working so much any more I would
    recommend doing the spell again. Mine typically last for a couple of months. This
    spell works for you and your friends. It'll work on any object for anyone!! Thank
    you and once again I would love feedback!!!
