    part about it is I was given a job to do, yesterday, which fits 3 (if not more)
    challenges on the list. So let’s dig in.

- en: The original request was to define energy. I’d like to split that a bit. Some
    may consider it splitting hairs or say I don’t have to work with these energies,
    but this is what I was shown during meditation, yesterday, so I choose to act
    on it for the betterment of all.

  zh: 最初的要求是定义能量。我想将它分开来。有些人可能认为这是挑剔或说我不必要与这些能量一起工作，但这就是我昨天冥想时所看到的，所以为了所有人的利益，我选择采取行动。
- en: What I saw was black. Can’t define it any other way. No shadow has ever been
    blacker. It was almost a solid, opaque, horrifying… but I could see it was not
    mine. I had invited it into my life by cleaning up the energies in my neighborhood-
    I guess I had become good at cleansing?

  zh: 我看到的是黑色的。无法用其他方式定义它。没有任何阴影比它更黑。几乎是一个实体，不透明，令人恐惧...但我能看出它不是我的。我通过清理邻里的能量将它邀请到我的生活中来-
    我猜我已经在净化方面变得很擅长了？
- en: Define it? I call it orphan energy. Someone had a problem they were unable to
    solve or had to leave before the issue was taken care of. The energy didn’t travel
    with them for one reason or another. That energy is assumed to fade or be grounded
    or sent to the Universe to be transmuted into something neutral and thus useable.
    If water takes time to be filtered into something drinkable, wouldn’t energy take
    time, also? With so many people on this planet who don’t know how to work with
    energy responsibly, it makes sense that some areas would have more energy to be
    cleansed than others; and the more people use, the more it builds up.

  zh: 定义它？我称它为孤立能量。有人遇到了无法解决的问题或在问题得到解决之前就离开了。由于某种原因，那股能量并没有随着他们一起离开。这股能量被认为会消退，或被接地，或被送上宇宙，转化成中性和可用性的东西。如果水需要时间才能被过滤成可饮用的东西，那么能量也需要时间吧？在这个地球上有这么多不知道如何负责任地处理能量的人，一些地区能量需要被清理的多也就合情合理；而且人们使用得越多，能量就积累得越多。

- en: If I have been made aware of it, the energy build up in my area must be intense;
    and if I have learned how to transmute such energies, I feel the need to do what
    I can to help- so someone else doesn’t have to deal with it. It is not a pleasant
    job, since I seem to be attracting more than my share of mess, but someone has
    to do it. Might as well be me.

  zh: 如果我已意识到它，那么我所在地区的能量累积必定是巨大的；如果我已学会如何转化这样的能量，我感到有必要尽力去帮助- 这样别人就不必处理它。这不是一项愉快的工作，因为我似乎吸引了比我应得的更多的混乱，但总得有人去做。不如由我来做。

- en: The videos are kaleidoscopic, beautiful to watch, and easy to meditate to. When
    I focus on the outcome I desire, I find the connections I need, and the magick
    flows. The videos are a tool, not the source of the magick. I haven’t figured
    out as yet if I am using my own energy or the Universal Source, but as long as
    the work gets done, the finer details will come later.

  zh: 视频是万花筒般的，观看很美，冥想起来也很容易。当我专注于我所期望的结果时，我找到了我需要的联系，魔法流淌而出。视频只是一个工具，而不是魔法的源头。至今我还没弄清楚我是在利用我的能量还是宇宙之源的能量，但只要工作完成，更精细的细节以后再说。
- en: 'Last night, I accepted the challenge posted by the Universe, the planet, or
    my neighborhood. The energy comes to me: I don’t search for it. I began again
    nightly watching of these videos with focused intention. Meanwhile, I chant over
    and over that I want the negative energy to be transmuted into something neutral
    and useable.'

- en: 'I was separate from all characters: unseen watcher. The setting was a beautiful
    Victorian mansion (think the house from the movie Psycho). It kept getting darker
    and darker with the energy gathered within. I could tell the building itself was
    not at fault. It was simply acting out in an attempt to get help for those living
    within it. However, once the energy got lodged within, it wasn’t going anywhere
    any time soon.'

  zh: 我与所有角色隔离：无形的观察者。场景是一个美丽的维多利亚式豪宅（想象一下电影《精神病患者》里的房子）。它随着内部聚集的能量变得越来越暗。我能感觉到建筑本身并没有错，它只是在试图为其中居住的人寻求帮助。然而，一旦能量被困在内部，它就不会很快离开。
- en: Buildings and places have their own understanding of energy. Compassion shown
    to the building or place itself is a binder to your energy which can help in the
    clearing process. Energy collected was not intended to be used by the building
    or place in a negative manner. Often what we sense as a haunting may be the building
    or place crying out for help in mitigating the negative energy into something
    more neutral and useable.

  zh: 建筑和地方都有它们对能量的理解。对建筑或地方本身的怜悯是你的能量清理过程中的一个粘合剂。收集的能量并不是要以负面的方式被建筑或地方使用的。我们经常感觉到的“鬼魂”可能只是建筑或地方在呼救，希望转化负面能量为更中性和可利用的。
- en: The cat knew what was going on. We often tell our pets what we feel and think.
    They cannot tell anyone, so our secrets are safe. Yet if the animal understands,
    there is the possibility that the animal could carry a heavy load of our emotions-
    added to their own life issues. I felt the need to tell the cat it wasn’t their
    fault.

  zh: 猫知道发生了什么。我们经常把我们的感受和想法告诉我们的宠物。它们不能告诉任何人，所以我们的秘密是安全的。但如果动物理解了，那它们可能承载了我们的情感负担——加上它们自己的生活问题。我觉得有必要告诉猫这不是它们的错。
- en: Our pets can be taught energy work. Whether or not they understand is up to
    them. The best way to teach them is to do the energy work in their presence and
    explain what is happening and why. When they get it, they can imitate what they
    see and feel… and help in the process next time.

- en: There was a butler. He would cut fruit and notice the fresh fruit was going
    bad more quickly than usual, but he had no idea why or what was going on. There
    was no understanding in order to assist the lady of the house, though he could
    sense something untoward was going on. When he left, he left it all behind because
    there was no energetic attachment other than the stress of the job.

  zh: 有一个管家。他切水果，他注意到新鲜的水果腐烂的速度比平常快，但他不知道为什么或发生了什么。他不了解情况，也无法帮助家里的女主人，虽然他能感觉到发生了一些不妥。当他离开时，他把一切都忘在了身后，因为除了工作的压力外，并没有其他的能量联系。
- en: 'The owner of the house was a young witch. People were blaming her for the negative
    energy; but she, also, was a witness to the source of the negativity. By not telling
    the authorities, she was harboring a criminal; but she didn’t have proof and didn’t
    know whom to tell to get help for the true victims. Meanwhile, the negativity
    was deepening into a curse, acting out on the witness rather than the original
    cause of the negativity. The witness was the weak link because of feelings of
    guilt: knowing it was wrong, but not knowing what to do to help.'

  zh: 房屋的主人是一个年轻的女巫。人们谴责她带来了负面能量；但她也是负面能量的见证者。由于没有向当局报告，她在庇护一个罪犯；但她没有证据，也不知道应该告诉谁来帮助那些真正的受害者。与此同时，负面能量演变成了诅咒，对见证者发动，而不是对负面能量的原始来源发动。见证者是薄弱的一环，因为她感到愧疚：她知道这是错误的，但不知道如何帮助。

  zh: 所以我们留下了负面能量被困在一个无辜的地方。我可以把它送到宇宙中，但即使是广袤的空间也会随着时间而不断被压倒。能量既不会被创造也不会被摧毁，只会改变形式。
- en: 'The best way to deal with it is to transmute it into something else. I consider
    the orphaned energy like a know it all teenager: full of something not fully understood,
    and in desperate need of guidance and active use. Put it to use in the community
    in some positive way or redefine the energy as something neutral, waiting to be
    used. If the energy has collected awareness, it can actively seek its own output,
    but that is rare.'

  zh: 处理它的最佳方法是将其转化为其他形式。我把这些被遗弃的能量看作一个自以为是的十几岁青少年：充满了某种未完全理解的东西，急需指导和积极利用。把它用在社区的一些积极方式上，或者重新定义能量，将其作为某种中性的东西，等待被使用。如果能量具备了意识，它可以主动寻找自己的输出，但这种情况很少见。
- en: A developer could pull energy from the site and use it to build something good
    for the community or someone could plant a garden nearby, focusing on pulling
    the energy from the house as a form of talisman… if the people know how to do
    energy work. Otherwise, the energy needs to be grounded and scattered for use
    elsewhere. I am the aware energy worker, so I can do a grounding and pull the
    energy with me, giving it a new home deep within the earth, intending it to be
    neutral for someone else to focus and use at some other place and time.

  zh: 开发者可以从现场汲取能量，用它建设对社区有益的事物，或者有人可以在附近种植花园，专注于从房子中提取能量作为护身符……如果人们知道如何做能量工作的话。否则，能量需要接地并分散到其他地方使用。我是一个富有觉知的能量工作者，所以我可以进行接地工作并将能量带走，把它安置在地球深处的新家中，打算让它对其他人在其他地方和时间专注和使用时是中性的。
