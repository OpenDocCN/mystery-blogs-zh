    parasites – entities that can affect our energy** and well-being without us being

    approaching this is **using incense**. The smoke is used to clear away negative
    vibrations and to purify a space that you're in. I make it a habit to use incense
    regularly, especially after having visitors, due to any outside energies they
    may bring in that could come in conflict with the balanced energy that I cultivate
    in my home. It's not really the guests' fault, but just something they bring with
    them, unknowingly a lot of the time, though sometimes they're aware of it and
    may want help with it. There are also other ways of practicing cleansing that
    do not involve using smoke, which others find useful.

  zh: 清洁是一种强大的精神卫生行为。我最喜欢的一种方法之一是**使用香熏**。香烟被用来清除负面振动，并净化你所处的空间。我习惯定期使用香熏，特别是在有访客后，因为他们可能带来的外部能量可能与我在家中培养的平衡能量相冲突。这并不完全是客人的错，只是他们带来的东西，很多时候是不知情的，虽然有时他们可能意识到这一点并且可能需要帮助。还有其他不涉及烟雾的清洁实践，其他人也认为这很有用。
- en: '**Salt baths** are another great cleansing technique. After a hard day in particular,
    salt baths are many people''s go-to. This is because salt is known for its purifying
    properties, and soaking in a salt bath can help draw out the negative energies
    from a person''s aura. I often add essential oils, such as lavender or eucalyptus
    for their additional calming, protective, and banishing qualities.'

- en: Finally, **using crystals for protection** can support your energetic cleanliness.
    Stones, such as black tourmaline, amethyst, tiger's eye, and many others are known
    for their protective qualities. I keep these crystals around my home and sometimes
    carry them with me if I want a little extra protection and especially when I'm

    previous advice I've given about cultivating a positive mindset and energy work
    practices, **creating a protective shield around your aura** is a technique that
    I recommend practicing regularly. This practice requires a bit more time and focus
    than the previous practice of expanding your energy outward from within in order
    to help solidify the energetic shield. To do so, envision a sphere of light encircling
    around you. This naturally attracts higher-level vibrations as well and helps
    keep negative energies and situations at bay. However, I will say that if you're
    in a terrible situation, it can also help lead to you eventually getting out of
    it and finding something better, as sometimes the best you can do in certain situations
    is move onto something better that matches your truest desires.

  zh: 为了预防未来问题，保护措施是很有帮助的。建立在我之前提到的培养积极心态和能量工作实践的基础上，**在你的光环周围创建一个保护屏障**是一种我推荐定期实践的技术。这项实践需要比之前从内部向外扩展你的能量更多的时间和专注力，以帮助巩固能量屏障。要做到这一点，想象一个光明的球体围绕着你。这自然吸引更高级别的振动，并帮助抵挡负面能量和情况。然而，我必须说，如果你处于一个糟糕的情况中，它也有助于最终帮助你走出困境，找到更好的事物，因为有时在某些情况下，你能做的最好的就是转向与你真实欲望匹配的更好的东西。
