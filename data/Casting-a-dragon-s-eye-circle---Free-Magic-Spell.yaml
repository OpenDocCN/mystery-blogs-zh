- en: The spell has several uses much like any traditional circle you would draw,
    and can include; protection, healing, cleansing of a sacred space, and of course
    as preparation for working a spell or rite/ritual. As such the circle will follow
    the intent you hold while making it so feel free to incorporate the process into
    other magics you wish to perform. Typically I draw this circle as a stand-alone
    when I want to create a small place of power by tapping into elemental energy
    and the earth's ley-lines/dragon-lines. The shape of the dragon's eye sigil is
    a natural draw of energy to a single point and the circle acts to hold that energy
    and lets it collect within the circle. To make a temporary or one-time use circle,
    simply draw it wherever is most convenient for what you intend to do. As long
    as it is a place where you are not likely to be disturbed for the duration of
    what you intend to do with it. Ideally in a natural setting where you can make
    the circle a part of the ground such as in earth among trees, in sand at a beach,
    or in chalk on the stone of a cave or cliff/rock. For a more permanent circle,
    you can draw it into a circle of cloth or heavy fabric to carry with you and place
    where needed, or of course you can incorporate the circle into your altar room.
    ---------------- Drawing the circle; 1) Draw your circle using your personal height
    as the measurement of radius. This is the representation of your connection to
    and ownership of the circle. Any medium works, so pick based on where the circle
    is. A branch or knife for earthen places, chalk, wax, etc for a harder surface
    or one you don't want damaged/carved. *tip* place a tent stake or weight into/onto
    the ground and tie a string to it that is measured to your height. Then just go
    around the circle with it stretched out to draw a smooth one every time. 2) imagine
    a clock face on the circle, with 12:00 being at north. estimate as close as you
    can three points on the circle, and mark them just inside the boundary. One at
    about the 2:00 hour, one at 6:00 hour, and one at 10:00\. now connect the 10:00
    to the 2:00, 2:00 to the 6:00 and of course the 6:00 to the 10:00 with straight
    lines, forming a triangle. 3) find a point as close to the middle of the triangle
    as you can. if there is a mark from the tent peg you used earlier, use that. Draw
    straight lines connecting each corner of the triangle to that central point. It
    should now look like a triangle made up of triangles, or like a pyramid if you
    were looking straight down at it from above. If you want to deepen the protective
    nature of the circle, you can also lay twelve stones in sun-wise (clockwise) order
    to represent the light of the twelve star houses, placing each stone with a spoken
    personal affirmation of protection. My Go-to statement is "I place this stone
    as I build this wall. The light of the twelve star-houses protects me." 4) When
    the drawing of the circle is completed (and the stones are laid), return to the
    east side of the circle. reach down and smooth out/un-mark an area of the circle
    that is only wide enough for you to step through. If you placed stones, lift the
    one from the 3:00 position and place it in your pocket. This will be the key to
    your 'door'. 5) Extras; if you have some fine iron or silver filings, you can
    sprinkle them about within the circle to act as a symbolic conductor of the energies
    you wish to draw up from below. You can also light incense, or use a singing bowl
    or chimes to represent the energy you wish to draw from above. Also, if this circle
    is being drawn as a part of a larger spell or ritual, this is when you would bring
    within any tools and offerings you plan to use to call your corners and otherwise
    do your working. ------------------- Closing/empowering the circle; 1) When it
    is time to use the circle and you have done all other preparations for your chosen
    intent, step to the 'door' to your circle and center yourself. A simple breathing
    exercise suffices. If you have a statement or affirmation you typically use to
    mark the beginning your magic rituals, you can do that now. If you laid stones,
    make sure you have the one you took with you when the circle was drawn. If you
    have a personal symbol of will that is not being included with the rest of your
    ritual like an athame, spear, sword, staff, or even just a sturdy stick, have
    that with you as well. 2) Step into the circle with confidence and full intent
    to use it for the task that it was built. Turn and draw closed the line of the
    circle so that it is once again complete. If you used stones, place the stone.
    With the theme of laying them before, I state "The stone is Laid, the wall is
    built, the lock is sealed." as I set it down. 3) Stand at the center of the circle,
    over the focal point of the dragon's eye sigil. Raise your arms to shoulder height,
    palms upwards or outwards, your symbol of will (if you are using one) in your
    dominant hand. Breathe in, visualize yourself in a place of strength, authority,
    and focused will. Breathe that energy out into your circle. 4)As you breathe in
    again draw your hands together in front of you at chest height, elbows comfortably
    bent, repeating your visualization. When your hands come together, breathe out
    again and release the second wave of energy to empower the first. 5)Finally keep
    your hands together and raise them up slightly, to the height of your brow while
    breathing in. While breathing in, repeat the visualization of building energy
    within for a third time. 4) Once the breath in is completed, without hesitation
    blow it out firmly in a huff and thrust your hands downward. If you have a symbol
    of will, press it into the ground at the top of the circle between the border
    and the sigil. Imagine the built energy following the gesture to fill the ground/floor
    of your circle and empower the drawn lines within, connecting them into a single
    continuous, unbroken line of light that glows upward and downward. Imagine that
    energy connecting to the flowing energy of the earthen dragon-lines and the nebulous
    strands of the aurora in the sky. You may now use the circle. This is where I
    usually sit at the center and meditate to raise my vibration to the highest state
    I can reach, letting the energies all collect and feed each-other to resonate
    within the circle. After a short time I imagine myself a bridge, allowing the
    healing and supportive energy of the earth to flow up my body from the soles of
    my feet through to upwards from the top of my head, and simultaneously imagine
    the highest vibration I can reach of spirit energy running through me from the
    top of my head through downwards to flowing out of my feet into the ground. Basically
    I allow myself to become a pipe to let earth and spirit energy connect into and
    feed/balance and heal each-other. For me it is a very powerful experience and
    can make a sacred space absolutely humm. Done even semi-regularly it can change
    the atmosphere of the whole place for an enduring time. -------------------- Opening/releasing
    the circle; When you are finished with your task, and any summoned spirits/guides/guardians/etc
    are dismissed and the magic working is fully concluded, simply touch your palm
    to the place you earlier thrust your hand (or take a hold of your symbol of will)
    and lift it gently from the spot. While lifting, mentally let go of the pent up
    energy and imagine it flowing away and fading like a morning mist. If you are
    keeping the circle in place for future use or to continue the working the next
    day/night, simply smooth out the eastern side of your circle and/or lift the stone
    at the 3:00 position and step out. Otherwise if you are finished with the space,
    clean up the site as you would any other circle by rubbing or washing out the
    circle and sigil and continue on your way.

  zh: 这个咒语有很多用途，就像你画的任何传统圆圈一样，可以包括：保护、治疗、净化神圣空间，当然还有作为施法或仪式的准备工作。因此，圆圈会根据你制作时的意图而变化，所以请随意将这个过程融入到你希望进行的其他魔法中。通常我在想要通过利用元素能量和地球的脉轮/龙脉来创造小型力量场时，会独立绘制这个圆圈。龙眼图腾的形状自然吸引能量汇聚到一个点，而圆圈则用来容纳并让能量在圆圈内积聚。要制作临时或单次使用的圆圈，只需在你打算做的事情最方便的地方画出它即可。只要这个地方在你做事的时候不太可能被打扰就可以了。最好是在自然环境中，你可以将圆圈融入到地面中，比如在树木间的土地上，沙滩上的沙子中，或者在洞穴或悬崖/岩石上的粉笔上。对于更持久的圆圈，你可以将它画在一块布或厚重的织物圆圈中随身携带，并在需要时放置，或者当然你也可以将圆圈融入到你的祭坛室内。
    ---------------- 绘制圆圈的步骤：1）用你的个人身高作为半径的测量标准来绘制你的圆圈。这代表了你与圆圈的连接和拥有。任何媒介都可以使用，所以根据圆圈所在的地方选择。在土地上可以用树枝或刀，硬质表面或者你不想损坏/雕刻的表面可以用粉笔、蜡等等。*提示*
    将一个帐篷桩或重物插入/放置在地面上，并用量好的绳子绑上到你的身高。然后绕着圆圈用拉直的方式来绘制一个平滑的圆形。2）在圆圈上想象一个钟表面，12:00点位于北方。尽量估计三个圆圈上的点，并在边界的内侧标记它们。大约在2:00点和6:00点各一个，以及10:00点。现在用直线连接10:00到2:00，2:00到6:00，当然6:00到10:00，形成一个三角形。3）找到一个尽可能靠近三角形中心的点。如果之前使用的帐篷桩上有一个标记，可以用那个。用直线连接三角形的每个角到中心点。现在它应该看起来像是由三角形组成的三角形，或者如果你从上面往下看，看起来像一个金字塔。如果你想加强圆圈的保护性质，你还可以按照顺时针的顺序放置十二块石头，代表十二星座之光，每块石头放置时都说出保护的个人肯定陈述。我的常用语是：“我把这块石头放在这里，这是十二星座之光保护我的证明。”
    4）当完成绘制圆圈（和放置石头）后，回到圆圈的东侧。弯下腰来，抚平/清除圆圈中只够你通过的区域。如果你放置了石头，从3:00位置的石头里拿出来放进口袋里。这将成为你的“门”钥匙。5）附加事项；如果你有一些细铁或银屑，你可以在圆圈内撒下它们，作为你希望从下面吸收的能量的象征导体。你也可以点燃香或使用唱钵或风铃代表你希望从上面吸收的能量。此外，如果这个圆圈是作为更大咒语或仪式的一部分而绘制的，那么现在就是你把计划使用的任何工具和供品带入圆圈的时候了，同时呼唤你的角落和其他你打算进行的工作。
    ------------------- 关闭/增强圆圈；1）当圆圈准备使用的时候，你已经完成了所有其他选择的意图准备工作，走到圆圈的“门”旁，集中精神。一个简单的呼吸练习就足够了。如果你有一个通常用来标志你魔法仪式开始的陈述或肯定语，你现在可以说出来。如果你放置了石头，请确保在你绘制圆圈时带了那一块。如果你有一个个人意志符号，比如一把利器，长矛，剑，权杖，或者只是一根坚固的棍子，也要带上。
