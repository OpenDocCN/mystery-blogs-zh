- en: One of the chief barriers people learning to project face is fear. Many are
    afraid that they may die, or be harmed in some way as a result of their projection.
    Nothing could be farther from the truth. The Canterbury Institute, renowned for
    its occult studies, executed an experiment in projection involving over 2,000
    people. None of them were hurt in any way by this, and now, three years later,
    none have complained of any newly arising problems.

    even the first step itself" to having an OBE. (out of body experience) This includes
    both physical and mental relaxation. The Poppet does not suggest a method of attaining
    this relaxation, although Progressive Muscle relaxation, coupled with deep breathing
    exercises (inhale 1, exhale 2, inhale 3.... until 50 or 100) are known to work
    well.

- en: This is known as the hypnagogic state. Once again, The Poppet doesn't recommend
    any method of doing this. One way is to hold your forearm up, while keeping your
    upper arm on the bed, or ground. As you start to fall asleep, your arm will fall,
    and you will awaken again. With practice, you can learn to control the Hypnagogic
    state without using your arm. Another method is to concentrate on an object. When
    other images start to enter your thoughts, you have entered the Hypnagogic state.
    Passively watch these images. This will also help you maintain this state of near-sleep.
    The Poppet calls this Condition A.

  zh: 这被称为催眠状态。再次强调，Poppet不建议任何方法来实现这一点。一种方法是将前臂抬起，同时将上臂放在床上或地面上。当你开始入睡时，你的手臂会下垂，你会再次醒来。通过实践，你可以学会在不使用手臂的情况下控制催眠状态。另一种方法是集中注意力在一个物体上。当其他图像开始进入你的思想时，你已经进入了催眠状态。被动地观看这些图像。这也将帮助你保持接近睡眠的状态。Poppet将其称为A状态。

    neural discharges. They have no specific effect. Ignore them. When they cease,
    one has entered what The Poppet calls Condition B. From here, one must enter an
    even deeper state of relaxation which The Poppet calls Condition C-- a state of
    such relaxation that you lose all awareness of the body and sensory stimulation.

- en: The ideal state for leaving your body is Condition D. This is Condition C when
    it is voluntarily induced from a rested and refreshed condition and is not the

- en: Another method is the "Rotation method" or "roll-out" technique. When you have
    achieved the vibrational state, try to roll over as if you were turning over in
    bed. Do not attempt to roll over physically. Try to twist your body from the top
    and virtually roll over into your second body right out of your physical self.
    At this point, you will be out of the body but next to it. Think of floating upward,
    and you should find yourself floating above the body. The Poppet suggests you
    begin with the lift-out method, but argues that both are equally efficacious.
