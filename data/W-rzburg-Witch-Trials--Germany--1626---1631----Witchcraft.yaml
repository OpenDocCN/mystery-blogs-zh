- en: The Würzburg Witch Trials in 1626 – 1631, were one of the biggest mass-trials
    and mass-executions ever seen in seen in Europe during peace time. 157 men, women
    and children in the city of Würzburg, Germany, were burned alive at the stake,
    with 219 executed in total in the city, and over 900 burnt altogether over the
    entire area. They were judged for sorcery and witchcraft and for having made a
    pact with the Devil, and were a part of the witch hysteria that precipitated a
    series of witch trials in South Germany at that time, such as at [**Bamberg**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/trials-bamberg/)
    (where over 300 executions took place), Eichstätt, Mainz and Ellwangen.

  zh: 维尔茨堡女巫审判在1626年至1631年间，是欧洲和平时期见到的最大规模的群体审判和群体处决之一。在德国维尔茨堡市，有157名男女老幼被活活烧死在柴火上，城市总共处决了219人，在整个地区共有900多人被烧死。他们因巫术和与魔鬼达成协议而被判，是当时南德地区女巫审判的一部分，如[**班贝格**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/trials-bamberg/)（超过300人被处决）、艾希施塔特、美因茨和埃尔万根。
- en: The persecutions were orchestrated by Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Prince
    Bishop of Würzburg, and his nephew Philipp Adolf von Ehrenberg, in the years after
    the Catholic re-conquest of Germany in the 1620s. In his reign of eight years
    from 1623 to 1631, he was responsible for burning 900 persons, including his own
    nephew, nineteen Catholic priests, and children of seven who were said to have
    had intercourse with [**demons**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/related-demonology/).
    People from all walks of life (including nobles, councilmen and mayors) were arrested
    and charged, regardless of age, profession or sex, for reasons ranging from murder
    and Satanism to humming a song with the Devil, or simply for being vagrants and
    unable to give a satisfactory explanation of why they were passing through town.

  zh: 迫害是由维尔茨堡的主教朱利乌斯·埃赫特·冯·梅斯佩尔布伦和他的侄子菲利普·阿道夫·冯·埃伦贝格，在1620年代的德国天主教重占领之后发动的。他在1623年至1631年的八年统治期间，负责烧死了900人，包括他自己的侄子、十九名天主教神职人员和七名据称与[**恶魔**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/related-demonology/)发生性交的儿童。从贵族、议员到市长，各行各业的人们因各种罪名被逮捕和起诉，无论年龄、职业或性别，原因从谋杀和撒旦主义到与魔鬼一起唱歌，或者仅仅因为是流浪汉，无法给出通过市镇的满意解释。
- en: Prior to 1626, there had been a first wave of witch trials in the city in 1616-1617,
    and then an isolated trial in 1625\. Friedrich Spee, a Jesuit whose experience
    as a confessor of witches in the great persecution at Würzburg (which turned his
    hair prematurely white), claimed that all the confessions were worthless, being
    based solely on torture, and that not a single “witch” whom he had led to the
    stake had been guilty. The trials were put to an end in 1631 when the city was
    taken by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.

  zh: 在1626年之前，城市曾经在1616-1617年间发生第一波女巫审判浪潮，然后在1625年发生了一起孤立的审判。弗里德里希·斯佩（Friedrich Spee），一位耶稣会士，曾作为大规模迫害下的忏悔者在维尔茨堡的经历（这段经历使他的头发提前变白），声称所有的忏悔都是毫无价值的，仅基于酷刑，他所领导的每一个“女巫”都无罪。审判在1631年被瑞典国王古斯塔夫·阿道夫夺取城市时结束。
