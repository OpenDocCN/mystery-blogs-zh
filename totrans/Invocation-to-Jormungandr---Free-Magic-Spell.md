# Invocation to Jormungandr

Sorce pagan book of hours. Just thought I'd share it. It is an invocation to the Midgard Serpent.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Invocation to Jormungandr'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** "Hail Iormundgand
Child of the Trickster
And the Hag of the Iron Wood,
Brother and sister of Death,
Neither male nor female
But complete within yourself,
Neither forward nor backward
But eternally circling,
Neither of the earth
Nor apart from it
But forever surrounding us
In our Middle Land.
Teach us, O Serpent,
Of what it is to see the end
And the beginning as one,
To see all things
In their place on the wheel,
To live with the turning
And not mistake it for a straight line
Even when the horizon
Is too far away
For our weak eyes to find."
