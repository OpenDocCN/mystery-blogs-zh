    AND http://mermaidblog14.blogspot.com/p/physical-shifting.html ) F shift/Fantasy
    shift: This is, in essence, basically just visualization and meditation. You have
    to imagine yourself as a mermaid, swimming around and doing whatever you think
    mermaids do! Its great for beginning, and helps you understand what you think
    your mermaid will look like, what the water against your skin will feel like,
    etc. It is important to note that you must meditate from the mermaid''s/your point
    of view. Do not see yourself as a mermaid, see as if you were a mermaid, if that
    makes sense. A shift/ Astral Shifting: While this shifting technique is very helpful
    and probably important, it is not necessarily needed to shift. Basically, it would
    be where you take your spirit out of your body, and go to an astral plane. There,
    you can shift your body into... pretty much whatever you want. Unfortunately,
    astral travel is insanely hard, and I have not yet figured out how to do it. Therefor,
    I will not be covering it in this site. If someone who knows how wishes to help,
    then that would be great.   Ph-shift/ Phantom shifting: This type of shifting
    gets a lot of results, and is one thing that a lot of P shifters use to get them
    ready for shifting (talk about that down there). This is where you literally feel
    what the mermaid tail (and top, maybe) will feel like. You dont officially HAVE the
    tail, but the energy surrounding you lets you feel the tail as if it where actually
    there. A good example would be to, say, pinch a part of your arm. After you pinch
    it, wait a few seconds, and then imagine feeling that pinch on your arm again.
    You may not actually feel it, but at the same time, you might.  M shift/Mental
    shifting: This ones going to be hard for us. This is where you change your mind
    to think like a mermaid, and you change your actions to that of a mermaid. Whats
    so hard about this, is that we don’t really know how mermaids act or think! However,
    I have compiled some ideas on how they might act, and how you can use that into
    your daily life.  MF shift/ Mental Flaring: This one will also be hard, as you
    let your animalistic (mermaidistic) side completely take over your brain. You
    would obviously bring yourself back later, but it exercises your bond with that
    part of you. Unfortunately, once again, we have NO idea how mermaids think, and
    furthermore, how to let that part of you take over. So this ones going to be a
    hard one as well. I will, however, try my hardest to help with the MF shift. 
    P shifting/physical shifting: Alright, this ones the biggy. Its the one where
    you completely shift yourself into your mermaid self. This is obviously the hardest
    of the shifts, and involves a lot of work and concentration. Like I said before,
    phantom shifting helps with this one! PNR/ Point of no return: Now, I know this
    sounds cheesy, but in the werewolf goal they talk constantly of not letting yourself
    go over the PNR. If you do, your normally stuck. However, the reason you are stuck
    is genrally because you lose all of your humanity and human thought power. Thus,
    you wouldn’t even know how to shift back. This would be a confusing subject on
    mermaids, because as far as we’re concerned, their an intelligent species. So
    I warn you before going any further, I’m not sure if mermaid shifting has a PNR or
    not, but its best to be careful.'

    I know, this doesn't sound like the most fun thing to do. However, researching
    that which you are trying to become is very important... and therefor, it is best
    to start here (even if you think you already know everything there is to know
    about mermaids!).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a mermaid- it doesn't have to be perfect, just make sure it establishes everything
    you think a mermaid would have. Top or no top? Gills or lungs? Scales or skin
    like a dolphin? Those sorts of things. This drawing should be done before any
    of your research... and have fun with it! Bring in some things you think it would
    be cool for a mermaid to have, or things that you would want as a mermaid. Save
    this drawing somewhere, or keep it with you while you research, you're going to
    need it!

    It is best to know everything you can possibly find out about mermaids, fish,
    anatomy, and so on. You won''t be JUST researching mermaids, you need to know
    some basic science principles about humans and fish (or dolphins, depending on
    what you base your tail on looking like) so that you can begin building your mermaid.
    Also, you''re going to have to figure out what environment you will be swimming
    in. If you live near lakes, then your mermaid would probably have a darker tail
    color, lungs instead of gills, and would be a freshwater mermaid. However, if
    you live next to a coral reef, then your mermaid might have a bright tail color,
    gills, and would be a salt water mermaid. It all really depends on the environment.

    the first metaphysical area! Don't move on to this lesson unless you have completed
    your research and drawing, because this is the part where you find your inner
    mermaid. What I mean by this is you will be finding out what exactly you will
    look like as a mermaid, and maybe explore a little in this very first meditation
    (and, your first F-Shift!). This part of your training involves meditation however,
    so it may be hard at first. For those of you inexperienced in meditation, I have
    included a quick warm up that you can do a couple times to get used to the idea.

    Many people will say you also need correct posture, although I for one am not
    one of them. The breathing is fairly simple, however. Begin by breathing in through
    your nose, and out through your mouth. Then, begin counting as you breath....
    As you breath in, count to three. Hold your breath for three counts, and finally
    exhale for three counts. You shouldn't be gasping for air or holding your breath;
    this type of breathing is supposed to relax you. Remember, this breathing comes
    naturally to your body, so after a few times of counting your breaths you should
    be able to breath like this on your own.

    keeping my mind on task and visualizing. Basically, you just go through the alphabet
    in your head. However, instead of just saying each letter in your mind, you have
    close your eyes and write out each letter in your mind. See the letter, say it
    out loud, almost feel your hand writing the letter. Feel each letter, and then
    let it go completely. You should spend about five seconds on each letter. Remember
    to not let your mind wander, and to not slip out of the moment (which is easy
    to do if you're tired!).  Try and see each letter in a place between your eyes
    and your mind, if that makes sense.

    help with this. Sit somewhere comfortable, close your eyes, and completely clear
    your mind. I know, this sounds very hard, but with practice it comes easier. Just
    think of absolutely... nothing. Don't think at all! It helps to begin with imagining
    yourself putting all of your thoughts and feeling and urges to move into a box
    and shoving it under a bed somewhere. Once you begin meditating, if you encounter a
    thought then the best way to get of it is to actually let it come into your mind...
    and then let it drift out. Acknowledge the thought, but let it leave your mind
    with peace. Simply trying to shove everything out of your mind won't work at all,
    things will just keep popping in. Finally, remember to focus on the nothingness,
    and not on keeping things out of your mind. Let the clarity of nothingness just
    wash over your mind. Don't worry, I know its hard, but no one expects you to be
    perfect!

    meditation! You may change it as much as you like, this is just my version.

    in every day life or something you can remember easily. Perhaps you are sitting
    in the sun, with the smell of grass all around you  and your skin is warm in the
    fading glow of daylight. Maybe, you have awoken in a creek, and the cold water
    is spilling over you as if you were a part of it's pebbled bottom. Slowly, get
    up. You see and feel and hear things as if you were there. You do not see yourself
    from a third person point of view. Look down. The first thing you see is an offering
    of some kind. It could be a candle, a fruit, a cake or maybe a feather. The next
    thing that you see is something that represents humanity to you... something that
    means something to you, and to humans. It could be anywhere from money to your
    favorite pair of shoes to a diamond ring. Whatever these two items are, pick them
    up. Now, look around you.
  prefs: []

    tell you is that the sun is setting, you are near a body of water, and it is absolutely
    beautiful. Let your mind explore this place... it is your haven. This is the place
    that you will come back to in your later F-shifts, and you should feel safe here.
    Slowly, you begin to walk towards the body of water. However, before you get to
    the water, you will see a... shrine of sorts. Like everything else, this can be
    whatever you wish it to be. It could be a small waterfall, or a tree, or a slab
    of rock. Whatever it is, set your offering here. Now, you speak. If you have any
    specific religion, you could talk to your god or goddess. If you are open to anything,
    then I would suggest speaking to the goddess Aphrodite, to the undines, or even
    to the element of water itself. Speak your wishes, and say what feels right to
    you. Finally, ask that you see your true form. Make sure to thank whoever you
    spoke to, and walk toward the water.

    mermaid. Say it, feel it, understand it, and do whatever you need to do to confirm
    it. As you let this humanity slip away, look down into the water. You see your
    reflection... only, its not you, and yet it is. The person that you see in the
    water is your true self, your mermaid self. Move your body so that you can see
    your full reflection, and take everything in. What you look like, what color your
    tail is, what color your skin and hair and eyes are.... everything. Let your mermaid
    self sink in, and let it become a part of you. When you are done gazing at your
    inner self, it is time to swim!

    if it were home. Dive into this water, and let your mind and heart run free! This
    is the truly amazing part of the meditation. In your mind, in this perfect little
    haven... you are a mermaid. So here, you can swim and laugh and have fun in your
    true form. Explore this area, because, it will be your mermaid home for until
    you actually receive your real tail. Don't be scared to let your mind create whatever
    it needs to create, and truly feel yourself as a mermaid.

    last look at your tail. Then, wishing your magickal sanctuary goodbye, let your
    mermaid body fall into darkness. Feel yourself falling until you hit your real
    body. Essentially, you're letting your mermaid body fall into your real body.
    Feel the last tingles of a tail and the last scents of the water.... and open
    your eyes.

    your first F-Shift. The land that you found here is always right there, right
    when you need it. Come back anytime. The more you meditate as a mermaid, the more
    your body gets used to the feeling of water, to holding your breath or breathing
    through gills, and to everything about being a mermaid. Also, it is important
    that you have fun with this meditation! There is no right or wrong, and your can
    improv anything you want into it. Do not be afraid to break the rules! One thing
    that you could add is talking to your mermaid self, or finding out your mermaid
    name (you could if you wanted to!). Nothing is wrong, just so long as you accomplished
    the task of finding your mermaid self. Good luck, and happy F-shifting!

- en: Alright! Hopefully, so far everything for you guys has been going smoothly. Unfortunately,
    M-Shifting is not as easy or strait forward as meditations or research. Lets view
    M-shifting as a big fence. Once you climb over it, its going to be really hard
    to climb back out again. Likewise, once you M-shift your mind and soul into that
    of a mermaids... its going to be really hard to go back to normal living. The
    ocean (or water in general) will call to you. You will be changed emotionally,
    mentally, and hopefully physically once you get to P-shifting. Therefor, it is
    my job to warn you right now that becoming a mermaid may not be the best thing
    for you. If you don't live next to a body of water like a ocean or lake... then
    what? Are you just going to sit in a bathtub looking at your tail for the next
    few years of your life? Like I said, the shifting method does not give you powers.
    Powers are something that you can get, but probably not from shifting (although
    if you would like to try with the shifting method, be my guest). Because of these
    two traits, it could be that you just want to be a mermaid because you want to
    be something special. A lot of us feel that way too, you're not alone... but please,
    just pause and ask yourself if you really want this. With that note of warning,
    lets begin your next step... M-shifting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: M-Shifting, as was cleared up before hand, is basically changing your mind and
    attitude to that of a mermaid. Unfortunately, mermaids are half way humans, and
    therefor don't really have an animal instinct or anything that you could draw
    from. Luckily for you however, if you've been following these lessons, then you
    now have a nice idea of how fish and dolphins act, and how your mermaid looks
    and acts. All of that is really important, because there is no set version of
    a mermaid. So, remember that mermaid drawing and research you did? Get all of
    that out and go over it now. It may be apparent to you, but I'm pretty sure everyone
    is going to come up with their own ideas and needs for what a mermaid IS, and
    so each and every person trying the shifting method needs to really look into
    behavior (i.e., a tropical mermaid that has lots of food resources and not many predators might
    have a different behavior then an arctic mermaid who is always looking for food.
    Likewise, a lake mermaid may eat and act differently in their confined space,
    than an ocean mermaid that has everywhere in the world)  . Of course, you should
    have already done all of this, but if you haven't for whatever reason, then its
    REALLY good for you to do that right now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So. Once you have this mermaid thing all down, its time to start applying it
    into your life. That means, that every day you will make a conscious effort to
    act more and more like a mermaid would act. Like I said, this may be hard, and
    I do have some ideas for you in the Tips and Ideas section. Remember however,
    that those are my personal views of mermaids. They may not apply to where you
    live or anything like that. Just be careful. Anyway, back to the M-shifting...
    you'll need to really change your life a lot. This is important, because it gets
    you used to this type of living, lets your mind draw out your inner mermaid, and connects
    you to the ocean and its spirit in a way that you may not have been before. Of
    course, simply acting like a mermaid isn't the only thing that you need to do
    to M-shift.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because this method is known as Metaphysical Shifting, there is obviously some
    other parts to it than just pure shifting. The metaphysical aspects of it mean
    doing meditations, balancing and learning to move energy, and connecting to the
    ocean or the element water. To conserve space, I have added a few of these things
    in the Tips and Ideas section, which you really should check out. While these
    things are not necessary to pure shifting, they are very helpful.

- en: '**Diet:** I believe mermaids would diffidently have to eat a mixed diet of
    both fish, shell fish, sea plants and possibly fruit. Now let me explain on this
    one. For our definition of a “mermaid” to fit the beautiful women with a gorgeous
    fish tail, we have to find a way to keep the human part of the mermaid looking HUMAN.
    Now imagine if mermaids only ate meat. That would make them predators, which would
    alter their appearances greatly. They would probably have more snout like noses,
    gills for sure, a fast, efficient tail that probably blends into the water (not
    exactly that gorgeous blue or pink that many of you want). The skin would probably
    take on a blueish tone, and the teeth would be sharp. For some reason, I dont
    think most of you want to be that when you think of being a mermaid. However,
    if a mermaid only ate sea plant life, they might wind up being somewhere at the
    opposite of the scale and look equally as odd. This puts mermaids in the position
    of eating a mixed diet, that somewhat mimics what humans eat. I added fruit in
    the main diet because we want to become mermaids who can walk on land, and therefor,
    they would probably be able to grab a bit of tropical fruit from the trees and
    such that tend to live near the water. It is also important that everyone adapt
    this image to their mermaid as best as possible. Once again, if you live near
    a lake, your mermaids diet will be different from someone living near the ocean,
    so on and so forth. So, with this information, we can bring this diet into our
    own. Try to eat fruit that grows naturally around your mermaids area. Eating shellfish,
    seaweed, and sushi is also very good too! Try researching the area that you live
    in, or where your mermaid comes from. See what grows naturally, and how you can incorporate that
    into every day life.'

- en: '**Habitat- **Well, we''re back to this one, that seems to pop up everywhere!
    Your mermaids habitat. Your mermaid''s habitat pretty much effects everything
    about your mermaid''s looks, diet, personality, and just about everything else.
    Therefor, it is very important. So, lets begin with some science. To maintain
    the upper part of a human, a mermaid would need to be warm blooded I believe.
    However, they may not be as warm blooded as humans are, due to their fish tail.
    Given this, a mermaid would be able to survive in some cold areas, but would really
    thrive in warmer ones. I personally would say that mermaid would thrive the best
    somewhere in the Caribbean, or in Hawaii. Unfortunately, there are not many of
    us that are fortunate enough to live in areas like that. So, it would be my guess
    that most of our mermaids would probably have to migrate in order to stay alive.
    Take all of this into consideration in how you design your mermaid''s fluke and
    all of that. Is it good for long distance travel? Anyway, while a mermaid''s habitat
    would most likely be some place warm or tropical, we''ll just have to adjust ourselves.
    Some good things that you might want to monitor in your Shifting might be your
    body temperature (going down would be good), or if you find yourself drawn to
    warmer places. Likewise, if you live in really cold places, you may find that
    you can tolerate the cold a lot. Either way, just make sure to monitor physical
    changes.'

- en: '**Social Behavior- **When you imagine a mermaid swimming freely in the ocean,
    what do you see? Well, you probably don''t see that mermaid swimming along in
    a group of three to six mermaids. However, with the science that I''ve found,
    I believe that in "pods" would be exactly how mermaids travel! Take dolphins for
    example. They are probably one of the closest relatives to the mermaid, and are
    therefor really good to learn from. Dolphins live in pods, or groups, of three
    to eight, and usually have some sort of "leader" dolphin. Dolphins have very special
    and unique bonds with one another, and are said to be closer than some human families.
    These pods travel together, live together, and stay together for most of their
    life. So, bringing that into mermaid context, it could be conceivable that mermaids
    live in groups. How does that effect your M-shift and life? Well, one thing you
    could do is try to connect with your group or family. Find a group that really
    understands you, and treat them like your mermaid "pod." It is also very useful
    to try and find some people in real life (as well as the internet) that actually
    want to become a mermaid as much as you do, or would at least understand your
    wish. This can both be supporting to you, and help you with the whole "pod," aspect
    of life.'

- en: '**Personal Looks- **Here is when we get into a touchier subject. It may come
    to your attention that you may not look like the mermaid that you''ve drawn out
    earlier. For instance, if your mermaid were a tropical mermaid, they would probably
    have tan skin to deal with the sun. If your mermaid lived out in the middle of
    the ocean, or deeper in the ocean, or maybe even in a lake... then their skin
    may be paler. Adjusting your looks to that of your mermaid can be very important
    in an M-shift, and help your mind get used to "changing." Also, (here comes the
    touchy part) if you are a bit over weight or out of shape, you may want to get
    that taken care of. One, because its really healthy if you do, and two because
    think about it... mermaid swimming takes just about every aspect of your muscles,
    and requires you to be a strong swimmer. The more weight, or the less muscle,
    the harder it is to swim. I know, I know, it is a hard subject, but believe me
    it will help your self image... human and mermaid wise!'

- en: '**Regular Behavior- **This one is probably the hardest one to figure out, as
    it has a lot to do with habitat, and with dolphins! As said before in the Social
    Behavior aspect, I believe mermaids share close bonds with dolphins. I think that
    if you were to mimic a mermaid, your first thing to do would to be learning from
    dolphins and other fish. This means being playful, enthusiastic, loving, loyal,
    and generally good learners. Next comes the habitat. Say your mermaid lives in
    a very cold region... Well, that may result in your mermaid being "colder" in
    attitude. Those mermaids would need to focus a lot more on survival than those
    living in tropical waters. Therefor, if you live in colder areas, you may need
    to adjust to taking note of your surroundings, and bringing your body into survival
    mode. However, if you live in warm areas, your mermaid might have playful attributes
    to it as well. Or, if your mermaid migrates, you may need to be more enduring
    than the carefree tropical mermaids. So on, and so forth.'

- en: The mental flare... I think may be one of the most fun, and easy, aspects of
    shifting (until you actually shift physically, that is!) For a recap, mental flaring
    is basically letting your mermaid mind take over completely. Out of all of my
    shifting, I've also found that the mermaid M-Flare is one of the easiest to accomplish.
    There is just something about the water covering your up, or the sun shining through
    the top of the water, or the warm sand pressing against your back that just makes
    the Mental Flare something magickal. So, how do we do it?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing I would pay attention to is how you look at the moment. If you
    are wearing jeans with your hair tied up in a pony tail and a t-shirt... well,
    thats not very mermaidish. However, being in your bathing suit with your hair
    down, shells adorning your body, and maybe some water proof makeup will probably
    make you feel a lot more like a mermaid away from home. For right now, don't even
    worry too much about if the accessories are accurate, or if mermaids ever wear
    makeup (they probably don't) or anything like that. Right now, you are just trying
    to feel like you are one! Another thing that helps so much is a fake mermaid tail
    or monofin. I have both, and believe me, it really makes you feel one with the
    water. Unfortunately, it also make you feel one with an empty wallet! Mermaid
    tails and monofins can be very expensive, especially if you have big feet like
    myself, and are forced into buying the $80, larger monofin, instead of the smaller
    ones that cost around $30-$50\. Also, the materials can cost a lot.... or, if
    you buy one from a website, the whole tail can cost a lot as well! To help with
    this mermaid dilemma, I have included some links at the bottom of the page- along
    with my views of them- to help you get your first fake tail. Take note, that while
    you do not need a fake tail to M-Flare, it is strongly suggested that you have
    one.... they're fun, and help with the experience!

- en: Now, the second super important thing to a Mental Flare would probably be your
    location. If you're just sitting on your bed in the middle of the night, or at
    school or something, then an M-Flare might be a little difficult. Remember- mermaids
    SWIM. They are meant to be submersed in water, swimming freely among their environment.
    So, while sitting in your bathtub may be a little bit better than sitting on your
    bed... well, its still not very good. For M-Flaring, I would suggest making your
    way to a pool, a lake, or even an ocean! My personal suggestion would be a nice
    salt water pool... there is a lot less harmful chlorine, its a lot more like the
    ocean, and you can open your eyes underwater! Further, there is room to swim,
    but its not as dangerous as the ocean or as dirty as a lake. Of course, on the
    down side... its not as natural. So, a good thing to do would be to have a mixture
    of each. If your mermaid is a lake mermaid, then I would try fresh water pools
    and ponds, and also swimming in the lake a lot. If you are an ocean mermaid, then
    I would try salt water pools and the oceans... but be careful. The ocean can have
    strong tides and currents, which are easily over come for mermaids, but not for
    humans. So, when swimming in the ocean, just make sure that you are at a very
    shallow or safe area before swimming. Also, if you are swimming with your fake
    mermaid tail, I would suggest having someone watch over you, just to make sure
    nothing bad happens. A dead human would not make a very good mermaid!

- en: Alright, now that you've got the two most important things all out of the way,
    its time for you to actually start M-flaring! While you can do small M-Flares
    anywhere, I would suggest setting a day aside just to M-Flare. You won't be like
    that all day long, but it would be a day to be... especially mermaid-like. For
    instance, that morning, you would wake up... and instead of taking a shower, you
    could take a bath and light a candle. Or, you could take a shower and use some
    body wash that reminds you of the ocean. While getting ready for the day, you
    could put on some water proof make up that makes you look like a mermaid... in
    your view at least. Do your hair with beach waves, or strait. Just have fun with
    it, there is not right or wrong! You could wear shells, and the color of your
    tail with a bathing suit underneath. For breakfast lunch and dinner, you could
    adjust your diet to that of a mermaids... (whatever you think a mermaid's diet
    would be! My ideas and thoughts are in the Tips and Ideas section!). Just spend
    the whole day in a bit of a mermaid daze. Then, when the time comes for you to
    actually M-Flare, you'll already be halfway there.

- en: So, I would begin in an area that you can sit or even lay down in the water
    without the water going into your nose, mouth, or eyes. Close your eyes and completely
    relax. Let the water wash over you, in your physical body. Feel the spirit of
    the ocean... the spirit of the mermaid washing over with every wave. Let the water
    draw this mermaid part of you out from your soul, and into your mind. Let your
    human mind go blank, and let mermaid thoughts and feels sweep through you. Don't
    worry, you still think, and you'll still need to breath air, and you won't lose
    yourself. Just change your mind into that of a mermaid. Feel a mermaids cravings,
    her instincts and thoughts. Finally, get up, and letting the mermaid part of you
    move you, slip into the water and swim. Remember, you are not swimming like a
    human. You are using your legs to kick up and down, and you are gracefully rolling
    through the water. Open your eyes if you can and look around. If you are in a
    swimming pool, open your eyes and imagine that right before you is coral,or sea
    weed, or the mucky bottom of a lake. Do not swim at the surface, but go down into
    the water. Don't worry about breathing; your body will bring you back to the surface
    and you won't drown. Likewise, don't try to push yourself too much with holding
    your breath. Just let your body do what it needs to do. I've actually found that
    in this state, sometimes your lungs won't start to hurt... they won't tell you
    that you desperately need to breath or anything. You just sit there wondering
    when you're going to need to come up for air, which usually happens after a while,
    but it also lets you hold your breath longer. Anyway, just try to enjoy yourself
    in this state. Be how you think a mermaid would be, in an out of the water. You
    should come out of your M-Flare feeling whole and connected to your other self.

- en: '**P-SHIFT:** Now this is how you would do your p-shift, what I (Brooke) recommend
    is that you let your mind tell you what to do, I think i''m so deep into shifting
    that all I can talk about is shifting, literally, my friend has gotten annoyed
    at me for not being normal for once. So off of my life, and onto yours!  So for
    p-shifting I would either let your mind and body tell you what to do to try to
    bring out your mermaid side (if you''re deep into the process), or practice the
    phantom-shifting technique, the one where you feel you have a tail, and all. This
    hasn''t been on many lists of shifting as it is considered unimportant. The phantom
    shifting has only supposed to have been for you to meditate, but it''s now helping
    me p-shift.  The p-shift means physical-shift, basically doing what the name insists,
    physically shifting into a mermaid with a tail and gills and all! But if you don''t
    know much about gills and expanded lungs I will tell you in the upcoming paragraphs!
    For now, some techniques for p-shifting. I will tell you the technique for ph-shifting,
    unless you already know this, then skip the first technique. Technique No. 1:
    Phantom Shifting technique: Sit in a comfortable position, legs right in front
    of you, together as if your legs were molded together, now lightly hold your legs
    together, not with your hands, rest your hands on your stomach, not by the sides
    of your legs. Now lie your back down once you know you are ready and breathe in
    through your nose, and out through your mouth. Keep on doing this, while FEELING
    as if your legs are slowly molding together, do NOT imagine in your mind your
    legs molding together, you have to feel it. Feel your legs getting closer and
    closer, until they mold together (even if it''s not happening in real life, you
    still have to feel it, it may happen after multiple tries!) Feel as your feel
    are connecting and stretching out into a long, sturdy, fluke in the shape that
    you desire. Now unless you are in the bath do not shift gills. Feel your legs
    slowly, very slowly coming together and forming scales, then slowly turning the
    desired color. Once you feel the need or want to leave, then go. Unless this has
    worked so far and you got your legs to mold together you have to meditate and
    try to reverse this and get out of it. There, you''re done! Technique No. 2: Under
    Construction:  **Gills and Lungs:** Now that we''ve got most things covered, (unless
    you skipped a whole bunch of stuff, most things are very important) we are going
    to cover gills, and lungs. For those of you that are younger, or just do not know,
    you CANNOT have gills on land. If you tried shifting gills in your bedroom or
    living room, go to the bathroom immediately and wash some water on your neck/behind
    your ears/wherever you have your gills and run a bath immediately.  once you have
    get in it and let your gills breathe. See gills, if you got gills on land or in
    your house, not in a bathtub, you would die. See if you had gills, they are just
    an overpowering way of breathing, you would instinctively start breathing with
    your gills, as you would in the ocean, but if there was no water around to get
    oxygen from you would die. Mermaid gills are in your nose, and behind your ears.
    Every mermaid has these gills, but if you really don''t want these or you just
    want to perpetually hold your breath instead with expanded lungs be my guest.
    In addition to regular mermaid gills, you could also have and add on either gills,
    placed directly on the ribcage, or gills placed on the front sides of your neck.
    Remember that you need to know exactly everything about gills, how they work on
    the inside, etc. You need to know where your lungs are/where your air tube is
    and have those gills have areas to breathe from there. Now we have lungs. if you
    would like you could have ONE large lung. But this may be harder for some, as
    you need to know where it would be, how the organs around you would work, etc.
    I personally would rather have gills, as I find them more easy shift into, but
    onto expanded lungs. For this you have to shift the insides of your body so you
    have one large lung, but you would need to come up for more air every once in
    a while because these are NOT gills and you cannot stay underwater forever with
    expanded lungs.  **~Coral Sirenia**  ___________'

- en: A physical shift, is physically shifting into a mermaid. This method of shifting
    takes the most practice, but with a little effort you can do it. The hardest part
    about shifting is calling your mermaid form out. You can't have any doubt when
    doing this. Because if you do, the tail will not come out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The easiest way to accomplish P-shifting is to have the F-shift, and the M-shift
    down to a T. Meaning you have to know exactly what your shifting for. Having a
    clear image of your tail in your head always helps. Also, you may want to be wet
    when doing this, and be in a quiet space where nothing will bother you. Below
    I have listed many shifting methods you can use, all from different people, you
    can try each one out so you know which one works best for you. Physical shifting
    takes multiple tries, so don't get upset if it doesn't work the first time.

- en: Method 1 is about visualization. First, get comfy and relaxed from head to toe.
    Remember not to wear pants, considering it stops the shifting process, and they
    may rip. So if you aren't comfortable being naked, wear a big shirt. You can also
    use candles, and music that reminds you of mermaids. My personal favorite is "Beyond
    the Sea" by Celtic Woman. Next, close your eyes and start focusing on your energy
    from the top of your head, to the tips of your toes. See in your head your fluke
    forming to your desire. At this point you may feel some pain at your feet, toes,
    and ankles. Keep visualizing the pain as your mermaid self becomes physically
    tangable, physically real. Visualize your mermaid self coming out of your body,
    and becoming real.  Do this SLOWLY and do not rush.
