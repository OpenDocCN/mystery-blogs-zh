- en: Before I begin, allow me to explain how negative energy works. According to
    the philosophical belief, "Law of attraction", what one puts in is what one receives.
    In other words, if one is full of negativity, one attracts unfortunate outcomes.
    If one holds positive energy, one attracts fortunate, or better outcomes. It is
    important to dispose of negative energy, especially when casting a spell meant
    to bring fortune.

- en: First, use the sea salt to create a circle large enough for one to be able to
    sit in a meditative position.  The purpose of the sea salt is to transfer the
    negative energy from the person to the sea salt, and cleaner energy from the sea
    salt to the intended person. Then, place the five candles around the sea salt
    circle as if forming a pentagram. The purpose of the candles is for uncrossing
    or aids the intended person to clear their mind.  Next, sit in the middle of the
    circle, and meditate for about 15 to 20 minutes. Visualize the exchange in energies.
    Feel the mind and body becoming calmer. Finally, after 15 to 20 minutes, blow
    out the candles. Dispose of the sea salt, for it cannot be reused due to the negative
    energy it holds.

    might take more/less time. you should feel calm, relaxed, happy and ''lighter''
    [think about how you felt after a relaxing day, good nights sleep, or otherwise
    carefree time]

- en: You are absolutely right. Depending on the amount of negative energy accumulated,
    the timing will be different for each person. When I performed this, I written
    the timings based on myself. I had forgotten to mention that timing varies for
    each individual. Thank you for stating this.

    spell might be a little too weak. As you said, it depends on the amount of negative
    energy
  prefs: []

    evil spirits nor curses.

- en: If you mean that you want to perform this yourself but for the benefit of a
    loved one, It might be do-able but it would be more difficult as it would be a
    'remote' process involving channeling. Basically you would need to hold your loved
    one in your thoughts, performing the process on yourself but maintaining the idea
    that you are only a guiding presence, and act as if the loved one was within the
    circle with you.

- en: As a note, this would indeed be a good process as a cleansing. As described
    it is heavily focused on clearing away/washing off negative energy/attachments.
    ...However there isn't any part of the process dedicated directly to affirming
    a protection against those energies trying to return. Now, for more experienced
    people this isn't necessarily a problem because building up positivity within
    the self does in itself push away negativity. But psychology plays a large part
    as many people create vulnerability doubting their safety. If you believe there
    is a weakness, then there becomes one. ...It's an ''action follows thought'' thing.
    So, I tend to suggest that a person take some sort of affirmative action/confirmation
    during or after a cleanse like this. Something simple, like a personal declaration
    that once you are cleansed, you will stay that way.
