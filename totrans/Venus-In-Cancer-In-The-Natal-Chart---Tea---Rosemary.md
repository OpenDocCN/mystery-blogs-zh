Venus in Cancer is a sensitive and empathetic placement. If you have Venus in Cancer, you will find that your emotions are an integral part of how you love.

Any Cancer placement is really emotionally deep and sensitive; Venus in Cancer is no different. 

Although Venus in Cancer men and women are distinctive from each other, they both have a delicate vibe that others simply sense.

## Venus In Cancer Characteristics

Venus rules so many areas that the characteristics of your Venus sign can have a large impact on your entire life. Here are the main ways that Venus in Cancer shows up.

### Money and Style:

With Venus in Cancer, you are very concerned with stability. You will take calculated risks with money but are generally shrewd. 

Even though you might not be focused on earning a *ton* of money with Venus in Cancer (unless you have other aspects of your chart to support this), you are typically careful about how much you spend.

You lead from the heart with Venus in Cancer, even when it comes to money or finances.

Style-wise, a Venus in Cancer person will either dress slightly sensitive and dreamy (maybe even artistic), *or* will dress edgy and tough to hide their sensitive interior in an attempt to protect themselves.

### Pleasure:

With Venus in Cancer, you are attracted to anything emotional. You may enjoy artwork, movies, angsty songs, etc.

As long as something invokes an emotion, you will probably be interested. You may like all things romantic or slightly sad, too.

With Venus in Cancer, you probably aren’t the biggest party animal unless you have other placements that indicate this. You’re very tied to people you love and your pleasure will involve spending time with those close to your or expressing yourself in some way.

### Values:

With Venus in Cancer, you value friendship and family. *People* are the most important to you.

Typically, you’re fond of children and the elderly, especially if you’re related to them.

You’re nurturing and creative with Venus in Cancer. You love to create traditions and buy others thoughtful gifts to signify your emotions.

You value caring for others. In some situations, you may even wish to become a caretaker. Emotional empathy is extremely important to you.

Above all, you value emotional security for yourself and others. With Venus in Cancer you tend to play it safe and don’t want any sort of risk.

### Attraction:

The typical Venus in Cancer is very cautious when they first like someone. They typically aren’t one to show their attraction right away.

If you have Venus in Cancer, you only want love *with* emotional involvement, but you have to take it slowly and cautiously. You have a hard, outer shell at first, like a crab.

You might actually come off as a bit aloof or removed, but you’re really just protecting yourself.

Most people with Venus in Cancer are attracted to potential partners who have a bit of softness in them, too. With Venus in Cancer, you can sense this gentle energy in others before they have even done anything to show it.

### Relationships/Sex:

In a relationship, a Venus in Cancer person is super attached once they fall in love. With Venus in Cancer, you can even get too attached to the past and forget to enjoy the present with your loved one.

You yearn for sensitivity and deep intimacy in love. Sometimes with Venus in Cancer, you can have boundary issues with significant others.

You’re afraid of getting hurt but you also want to feel close to your partner. You need to get to know someone and develop trust yet you also fall in love quickly.

In a relationship, you’re very tuned into the unspoken thoughts of your partner. You need security, nurture, and comfort, but you give this all back in spades.

You show your love by caring and noticing the feelings of your partner. However, you will sometimes be the only one doing this. If you don’t feel that the emotional attention is being returned then you can start to become resentful, although you probably won’t tell your partner what’s bothering you.

When you feel rejected, you retreat into your crab shell. With Venus in Cancer, it can take you a while to come back out.

You can also be easily offended or feel unloved with Venus in Cancer. Your partners might feel that they need to walk on eggshells.

If you still feel resentment towards your partner from anything they have done, you probably won’t say anything. Your partner will need to sense what’s going on.

You probably aren’t super straightforward with your feelings; your partners might have to guess what’s going on if they feel that something is off. However, you are equally as observant towards your partner’s emotions.

With friends, you’re loyal and like to stay in touch. You’re very good at making your friends feel nurtured and cared for, but you want them to reciprocate this affection.

With Venus in Cancer, you hold on to hurt feelings and might even act passive-aggressive or revengeful towards someone who has hurt you.

If there is trauma, a Venus in Cancer individual might have a lot of casual flings because they are looking for love in the wrong places. Otherwise, they like to be in relationships.

In relationships, you will need lots of snuggling and sentimental talks with Venus in Cancer. More emotion is always better.

## Venus In Cancer: Best & Worst Qualities

Every placement has positive and difficult qualities. Sometimes, a quality that you feel is positive can *also* be difficult. Neither can exist without the other.

Venus in Cancer is sentimental and caring but can be melodramatic and insecure due to their extreme sensitivity.

These are some of the most common good and difficult qualities. Keep in mind that you might not have all of these qualities, but you will probably see a good number show up, especially in the area of the house that your Venus is in.

Best:

*   Sensitive
*   Caring
*   Nurturing
*   Cautious
*   Wholehearted
*   Affectionate
*   Dependable
*   Protective
*   Intuitive
*   Sentimental
*   Maternal/Paternal
*   Loving

Worst:

*   Vulnerable
*   Emotional
*   Melodramatic
*   Insecure
*   Leery
*   Boundary Issues
*   Harbors Resentment

## Venus In Cancer: Man Versus Woman

This part can get a little confusing, so bear with me as I explain it. Basically, Venus shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it does for someone with more feminine energy.

It’s up to you to choose with energy you identify with more. If you’re unsure, I recommend reading the description of each energy for Venus in Cancer below and choosing what resonates with you.

Generally, in a woman or someone with feminine energy, Venus will show how the person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person is flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Venus in Cancer. These Leo qualities will show up directly in the personality.

In a man or someone with masculine energy, Venus will show what kind of qualities they are *attracted to*. How this person will *act* depends on their Mars sign, but their Venus sign dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a partner.

As we evolve and change and the gender lines blur, these distinctions become less absolute. For example, I find that *most* women will show a lot of the qualities of their Venus when they’re flirting, but a few of their Mars qualities will bleed through also.

It’s important to learn about both Venus and Mars. Each person has a unique combination of both qualities, although this combination may be swayed slightly depending on the person’s gender.

Lastly, a man who is ultra-comfortable with his sexuality will display many more of his Venus qualities, while a man who struggles with his sexuality probably won’t “own” these Venusian qualities, so he will instead look for them in a female partner.

## Venus In Cancer Man

The Venus in Cancer man is attracted to everything feminine about women. He can theoretically be interested in a woman with any type of look, but he tends to notice feminine attributes like long hair, simple and sweet clothing, soft summer dresses, and aura of innocence, etc.

The Venus in Cancer man is also attracted to someone who shows their emotions and is able to be vulnerable. He wants someone who *sees* him emotionally and appreciates him for who he is.

This man will usually pick women who are unlikely to reject him. Any type of rejection is extra hurtful to a Venus in Cancer man.

He will have a hard time letting go of a relationship, even if the partnership goes badly. 

The Venus in Cancer man is romantic and loving. He is protective, but at his worst, he can also be jealous or possessive.

This man needs an intuitive connection with his lover; he wants both partners to be able to sense each others’ feelings.

The Venus in Cancer man desires someone he can take care of. He loves to provide for his partner.

Sensitivity is big for the Cancer man, even if he doesn’t show it. He may hide behind the “crab” shell because he has such a gentle internal world.

It can take the Venus in Cancer man a while to open up to his partner. He is really protective of his feelings and needs to be sure he can trust someone. 

Typically, the Venus in Cancer man will be like a parent to his family and friends. He is the caretaker of the group. He’s very protective of those he loves.

He may try to be the hero for everyone, not for the glory, but because he feels the need to save everyone.

Sometimes, the Venus in Cancer man can end up with emotionally unstable partners because he attracts people who he needs to “mother.” He may do this completely unconsciously, but the end result is a lot of emotional turmoil.

Ideally, the Venus in Cancer man will feel needed but not suffocated. He wants a partner who lets him take care of them but who doesn’t need a full-on surrogate parent.

## Venus In Cancer Woman

When the Venus in Cancer woman first meets someone, she will remember the small details about them that strike a chord with her emotionally.

This woman comes off as sweet and vulnerable when she’s first flirting. She’s very responsive to others’ emotions, but she probably won’t make the first move.

She may even have a nurturing or mothering energy. She feels like a safe haven to those she meets.

The Venus in Cancer woman is typically approached by potential partners who like her quiet, shy, emotional innocence. She gives off a soft and sweet energy.

Even if other parts of her chart make her more abrupt, a potential partner will sense this softness underneath.

In a relationship, the Venus in Cancer woman looks for safety and security. She wants a partner who is sincere and genuine, someone who will never hurt her.

The Venus in Cancer woman can be a bit needy in relationships. She might have trouble establishing boundaries. It’s easy for her to get into codependent relationships because she might attract needy types, too.

If the Venus in Cancer woman does get into a codependent relationship, then she may come to resent her partner over time.

However, the Venus in Cancer woman will most likely side-step problems or avoid actual confrontation, especially in a relationship. The resentment may build up inside of her and come out sideways.

The Venus in Cancer woman is extremely loyal in a relationship. She falls in love very deeply. Ideally, she would have a strong partner who she can depend on.

She is typically scared to reveal her love and will need her partner to reassure her quite often. If there is a breakup, the Venus in Cancer woman will get extremely hurt. It might take her a long time to recover.

The Venus in Cancer problem looks best in clothing that’s feminine in some way. She might dress innocent and sweet or edgy and sexy, but she will *somehow* accentuate her feminine attributes.

In bed, the Cancer in Venus woman is caring, loving, and sentimental. Love goes along with physical expression; she needs both to feel satisfied.

## How To Master The Venus In Cancer Energy

With Cancer in Venus, you want to learn empathy with detachment. You have a lot of deep compassion, but you tend to *merge* with the feelings of others and lose sight of reality.

It’s good to introduce a dose of logic into your emotional world. Learn to look at things using reason without shutting your emotions down.

It’s also helpful for you to find a group who cares for you as you care for them. With Venus in Cancer, you offer a lot of devotion and loyalty, but you should be careful that you don’t wind up with people who take advantage of you.
