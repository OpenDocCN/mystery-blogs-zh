    practices, including Wicca. In Wiccan traditions, practitioners often use spells

    understand the significance of cleansing and charging the crystal. Cleansing is
    the process of removing any negative or stagnant energies that the crystal may
    have absorbed. This can be done by placing the crystal under running water, burying
    it in salt or soil, or smudging it with sacred herbs such as sage or palo santo.

    energies. This can be achieved by placing the crystal in natural sunlight or moonlight,
    burying it in the earth, or using visualization techniques to project intention
    onto the crystal.
