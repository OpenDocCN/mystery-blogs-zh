    aspects also indicate how emotional you *appear* to other people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the beneficial Moon-Ascendant aspects, you not only have a healthy means
    of expressing emotion, but you’re able to pick up on and adapt to the emotions
    of other people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the more difficult aspects, you either can’t express your emotions or they
    come out sideways. You still intuit how others feel, but you don’t react to those
    emotions in a way that truly serves you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, Moon-Ascendant aspects are beneficial to learn about because by
    working through these issues, you can express a more authentic version of your
    emotional self.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon conjunct Ascendant, it’s hard for you to hide your emotional self.
    This aspect means that you emotions are on display for everyone else to see; how
    you feel is obvious to others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You interact with other people almost automatically through your learned habits.
    In fact, your emotions dictate many of your outward reactions. Your relationship
    skills were conditioned at an early age by your family (particularly by your mother
    or female caretaker).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon conjunct Ascendant means that you’re really impressionable. You pick up
    a lot of energy from the environment and are sensitive to even the slightest changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way that you present yourself may be confusing to others because you give
    off mixed signals. It’s as though who you *are* changes as your emotions change.
    Even your physical appearance may appear to morph with your moods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon conjunct Ascendant can indicate that you try to keep others at arm’s length
    but simultaneously desire deep relationships. In fact, your outer personality
    is filled with these types of contradictions. Others just can’t figure out what
    you actually want. This is because your outer personality is ruled by emotions
    rather than logic, so you change as your moods change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your facial expressions reveal many of your moods, even if you do try to hide
    them. However, most people with Moon conjunct Ascendant don’t even realize that
    they appear moody to others. They simply feel that their personality is who they
    are *in the moment.* They don’t realize that their extreme sensitivity and reactions
    are confusing to others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon conjunct Ascendant, your emotions are often based on what you interpret
    others are feeling about you. If you sense that someone has a negative thought
    towards you, your whole mood and persona will change. You might be extremely sensitive
    and reactive with this placement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your Moon conjunct Ascendant is in the 1st house, you will have frequent,
    outward emotional displays. If your Moon conjunct Ascendant (or either planet/point)
    sits in the 12th house then these emotional displays will be hidden or below the
    surface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have a strong attachment to family, your childhood, and your home, but this
    can also make you moody. All of these topics will trigger emotional responses
    that you can’t contain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this conjunction, you can be needy or dependent based on your mood. You
    want to care for others or desire to be cared for in some way. Emotions simply
    don’t understand boundaries, and neither does your outer persona. However, this
    can shift quickly based on your mood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people with the Moon conjunct Ascendant aspect show these qualities negatively
    as moodiness, too much sensitivity, and taking innocuous things personally. Others,
    with a bit of work, are more positive and use their emotions in an empathetic
    way towards others. There is a whole spectrum with this aspect!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have Moon conjunct Ascendant, it’s helpful for you to find an outlet
    to express your emotions. The specific outlet will depend on the sign that the
    conjunction is in. Some people enjoy art, journaling, exercise, performing, etc.
    You simply need a way to get the emotions out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be careful that you don’t take things too personally. You may read into every
    movement and facial expression that you see on someone else. You can be extreme
    sensitive and reactive, but you can use this for good because you have so much
    empathy, too. You must simply incorporate a bit of logic to temper your reactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should also work to place less importance on how others see you. Sometimes,
    you allow the moods of others to dictate your own emotions. Work on defining clear
    boundaries with empathy and kindness.

    off a calming emotional energy with this Moon trine Ascendant aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have a lot of insight into the behavior and moods of others. In fact, it
    can seem like you have an uncanny ability to see what others are feeling, even
    when they’re not expressing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the conjunction, you’re very articulate when expressing your emotions.
    This is something that comes naturally with Moon trine Ascendant. You know how
    to speak about your own emotions without triggering others or making them feel
    insecure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re highly adaptable to the feelings of others. You sense when someone is
    feeling a certain way and will change yourself to fit the situation, but you manage
    to do this in an authentic manner, remaining true to yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, Moon trine Ascendant also means that you’re extremely sensitive.
    Although this is often a positive quality, extreme sensitivity can cause a lot
    of emotional pain, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your goal is to incorporate logic into your emotional landscape in order to
    *reason* with your sensitivity. Don’t lose your empathy in the process, but simply
    work with facts to ground yourself so you don’t spiral out of control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the Moon trine Ascendant aspect, you probably have a deep connection to
    your family or town/country of origin. Although this can definitely cause some
    emotional strain, this is also a quality that grounds you when your feelings are
    too intense.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon sextile Ascendant, you have some natural abilities with your emotions,
    but most emotional qualities need to be developed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect means that you have the opportunity to learn how to pick up on the
    moods of people around you. Right now, you probably sense emotions to some degree,
    but you haven’t quite refined this practice. It doesn’t come as naturally to you
    as it does to those with the trine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re probably very good at gauging the moods of groups in general. When you
    walk into a room, you can sense the emotional tone of the gathering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a skill that you can hone and make more *conscious*. It can open up
    career opportunities for you or even help you in your personal life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also have the opportunity with Moon sextile Ascendant to learn how to show
    your emotions in an authentic way. You sometimes feel like you aren’t quite sure
    how to reveal your emotions to others, but a bit of practice will help you gain
    confidence in your emotional expression.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, your sensitivity can be your weakness. As a child, you probably felt
    uncontrollable sadness when you learned about painful things in the world. Again,
    you have the opportunity to overcome this using logic.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon opposition Ascendant, you are highly sensitive to the impressions
    of others. It can be emotionally draining to you if you feel like someone else
    doesn’t like you, even in the smallest way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you put off a cold, guarded, and detached vibe. Other people might
    see you as completely unemotional, or believe that your emotions are locked deep
    down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon opposition Ascendant, you’re *very* good at hiding your emotions from
    the outer world. Unless you want people to know you feel a certain way, no one
    will see even a hint of your true emotional landscape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’re in a relationship, this all changes. Moon opposition Ascendant means
    that you might look for a partner who will emotionally support you. You may even
    want someone to “fix” your emotional problems. This is because you don’t know
    how to do the emotional work yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You look for emotional interdependence in relationships with Moon opposition
    Ascendant. Although this makes for really caring relationships, it can cross over
    into codependency. You want your partner to figure out what you need because even
    *you* don’t know.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, if you partner doesn’t give you *enough *emotional support, you
    may feel stifled or unappreciated. Again, this is because you don’t really have
    a grasp on your own emotional needs. They are all completely unconscious.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal with Moon opposition Ascendant is to take responsibility for your own
    emotions and learn to be your own person, separate from others. See that it’s
    alright to share your emotions with others, even publicly, as long as they’re *yours*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learn how to figure out what your emotional needs are, then try to authentically
    show them to others. The first step is to go within, because if you don’t know
    what you want, you won’t be able to explain it to other people.
  prefs: []

- en: Moon Square Ascendant
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon square Ascendant, the way that you express yourself conflicts with
    how you truly feel emotionally. Your words, tone, or even body language is inaccurate
    or off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s easy for you to misinterpret how others feel about you, especially when
    you first meet them. You typically interpret others’ feelings to be stronger than
    they actually are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, someone may dislike one thing you said, but you interpret this
    to mean they dislike *you*. Because you’re *so* sensitive to the energy of others,
    you quickly blow things out of proportion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the signs involved in this Moon square Ascendant aspect, you can
    also take rejection quite personally. You react to rejection based on the signs
    involved, as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You typically don’t express your true emotions with Moon square Ascendant, at
    least not in public. You’re scared of how others would respond to your authentic
    feelings, so you hide them away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although you sometimes shield your emotions, because you don’t want to elicit
    a negative reaction from other people, you *also* hide them to avoid relationship
    problems. However, this increases your inner tension. At some point, your emotions
    will come out sideways, either through passive-aggressive behavior or angry blowouts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon square Ascendant usually develops because you couldn’t show your mother
    how you truly felt, at least some of the time. She probably reacted in the manner
    of the moon sign; for example, with Moon in Aries, the mother would have gotten
    angry when you revealed emotions that she didn’t like. Your mother unconsciously
    taught you that your emotions should not be seen by others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Her reactions also taught you to be extra sensitive to the emotions of those
    around you in order to avoid causing upset. However, as an adult, this no longer
    serves you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you grow with this placement, you must learn to be less self-conscious about
    saying what you feel. Sure, your expression of emotions may elicit a negative
    reaction from someone, but learn to discern whether this reaction is towards what
    you’re feeling or you as a *person*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately with Moon square Ascendant, you need to develop a sense of emotional
    security within yourself. Learn that it’s alright if others don’t approve of you
    as long as *you approve of yourself*. You will feel much more content within yourself
    when you finally express what you authentically feel.
