I found it at a website

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Spell to Make you Invisible'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**Relax and become conscious of every part of your body. Feel your skin. relax and feel the photons of light hitting your skin, a rain of warmth over your entire body. Now start repeating to yourself. ''Light pass through and around me, nobody will see me. Light pass through and around me ...'' and as you chant (out loud or in your head) feel the rain of photons passing around and through you until you don't feel them any more. Bang! you are effectively hidden.

I have done this in class then raised my hand to answer questions and have the teacher look straight at me and say ''You mean nobody will even try'' and people looking for me look right past me. I will say that the invisibility is fairly fragile meaning that if you make yourself noticed people will notice. I assume that you could do a similar things for other objects. I have never actually tried it but I believe it would work

This should work. Remember you will not become physically invisible, you are hiding your energy so people overlook you.
