# Triquetra Power Awakening

  Rated 1/5 Stars

how to wake up your magickal powers using the triquetra?

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Triquetra Power Awakening'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 White candles

*   1 Rose Incense

*   1 Jasmine Incense

*   1 Patchouli Incense

*   Triquetra (necklace, alter tile, or drawing)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 White candles

*   1 Rose Incense

*   1 Jasmine Incense

*   1 Patchouli Incense

*   Triquetra (necklace, alter tile, or drawing)

 Now place the Triquetra in the middle. Put one white candle in each corner of the symbol and if you are using incense sticks put one stick in every corner of the Triquetra between the symbol and the candle. In the lower corner put Jasmine, on the top the Rose and the third corner place Patchouli. Alternatively, if you use dry flowers or oils put the incense/oil burner underneath the Triquetra, in the middle and a bit above of the two lower candles. Now light the candles and the incense (sticks or incense/oil burners) and chant 9 times (three times three) with all your heart and with a smile upon your face:


> **"Powers of high, listen to my plea
> Three aspects of the Divine I invoke thee.
> This magic time, this magic hour
> I ask you to lend me your power.
> Bless this symbol with your love,
> Bless this symbol with your might,
> I feel you with me day and night.
> Hear my call, hear my plea
> Three as One always with me!
> Three as One forever be!"**

Now thank the Gods/God for their gifts and love and leave an offering (as you can imagine three offerings suit better to this spell J ). For maximum potency repeat this spell for three consecutive days, even better schedule the spell to start one day before the Full Moon, repeat again the day of the Full Moon and once more the day after the full moon.
