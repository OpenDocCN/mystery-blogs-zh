- en: First grab the gray cloth bag. It must be gray because the color gray helps
    with loneliness. Next, add the dried Dandelion. Dandelion is used in healing rituals
    that are focused on depression. After that, add the Honeysuckle. Honeysuckle is
    known for helping with willpower. This can help battle the depression. Lastly,
    add the dried Lavender and the aromatherapy oil. To put the oil in the bag, place
    around 5 drops onto a piece of tissue. Lavender is commonly known for its relaxation
    properties, which can help calm the persons mind. Using agate is optional, but
    it is definitely beneficial. Agate has properties of relieving sadness, helping
    with mental health / depression, healing, and more energy. I highly recommend
    using it. Once you put all the ingredients into the bag, then you are set.

    into the cloth bag. To start with this, you will need to center yourself.

    shape it into a ball. Think happy thoughts and determination as you are forming
    this energy. Then slowly push it into the gray cloth bag. Now you're done!

    You are either borrowing it from your surroundings or yourself.

- en: Herbs can be very helpful in treating mental illness from my experience, and
    I think this seems like a spell that could work and help people. However, if one
    is suffering from clinical depression or another mood disorder, they should seek
    professional treatment in addition to magick, rather than relying completely on
    spells.
