> **"Sacred stone or purple true Wake my sight and please embue With sight of past and future vision To help all those with tough decisions Growing stronger with each hour Both sacred strength and sacred power At the flicker of this candle's last burn The visions I seek and secrets I will learn. When I wake I shall remember only what is important and the small shall not dwell So I will have no confusion and my brain will not swell."**

Place the amethyst at the foot of the candle and let the candle burn out. When the candle has burned out place the amethyst under your pillow. (The Candle must burn out completely. . . . . . no cheating)
