  prefs: []

- en: Well you won't transform physically but you could where a wolf skin and hypnotize
    your self into believing you're a wolf. And because perception is reality you
    would in fact become a wolf.

- en: I wouldn't recommend it, not because you will become a werewolf but because
    with the coronavirus currently making its rounds it's probably the worst moment
    in history to ask a stranger to bite you. [once the pandemic is over, I still
    wouldn't have a person bite you because a human's mouth is a germ factory, also
    you can't become a werewolf]

- en: It is believed that some Shaman are gifted the ability to shapeshift. This knowledge
    is passed onto them by an elder after the Shaman has proven themselves worthy
    of this honour. I am certain this is not it, and that this is fake. At best, you
    could use this in a ritual to connect with a wolf spirit, but you will not physically
    transform into a wolf.
