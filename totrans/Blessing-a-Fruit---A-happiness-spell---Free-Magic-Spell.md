**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A fruit (preferably a nice and ripe citrus fruit but any works)

*   Oil to anoint the candle - I used mint (optional)

*   Incense for energy boosting (optional)

 Cleanse your space, cast a circle (optional) and if you have one, light an "energy boosting" incense.

Carve a sigil or rune into your candle - I used a binding rune that represents happiness.
Dress your candle with oils and the herbs. Place the candle in the middle of the plate.
Scatter some mint and vanilla sugar around the plate as well.
Arrange your crystals so they point in towards your plate in order to direct their energy that way (this is easiest done with crystal points).
Cleanse your fruit of choice and make your intentions clear - tell your fruit that it will be full of happiness, joy, love, healing, peace etc. and it will only contain energies that are beneficial to you. You can also meditate with your fruit as well - take your time!
Cut the fruit open into 4 slices and arrange them on the plate with your candle - make sure it doesn't directly touch the candle.
Light the candle. Let it burn for a while - feel free to meditate around the candle to connect with it. Draw in as much positive energy as possible and let the fruit absorb all the goodness.

When you feel ready, close out the spell and eat the fruit to absorb all the love and happiness!
Thank the universe, the spirit(s) and (if you work with any) the deities that has helped you out with the spell and blessed you with this magical fruit. Feel the love, the joy and the warmth absorb into your body - blessed be!

Also, important to note: The candle doesn't have to burn down fully because this ritual is repeatable - it's actually better the repeat it multiple times!
