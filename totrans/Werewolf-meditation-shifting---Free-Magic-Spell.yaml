    items for this spell:**The first thing to do is relax. You must be fully relaxed
    for this to work. I suggest you sit against something. Next you need to picture
    your wolf body and will yourself to become it. Bring yourself into thinking that
    and you will become your wolf. If you concentrate hard enough and will it to happen
    after time it should happen.'

- en: Concentrate on this and then your arm or leg muscles will begen to get restless
    or actually hurt! Don't worry! The pain only exists the first time. Later transformations
    can still be slightly uncomfortable or be numb or itchy or even feel very good
    and give off a high, its case by case really. Continue on concentrating and do
    NOT fight the pain. Fighting it will only make it worse and stop the shift. Eventually
    you will shift.

    their wolf instincts the first couple times they may become a real danger to others.
    What I recomend you do is go into your room and lock the door.

    and will yourself back into your human form. Or you can just curl up and go to
    sleep. You will wake up back in your human form. (Your body and mind will revert
    to the form they are most happy in.)

    but this one probably will not.

    there is not magic which will turn you into a werewolf physically. Werewolves
    are mythical creatures and have never existed in real life.

- en: Hmmm, this is an interesting read. As a shapeshifter myself, I wonder if this
    would actually cause someone who is previously unawakened to themselves would
    be forcefully awakened and even be unstable in their animal mindset (because it
    was a forced awakening.) This feels like this would work, but based on how its
    explained the author has never actually physically shifted using this method.
    Dont get your hopes ups anyone, physical shifting isnt as cool as you would like
    to think, and you wont be able to shift using this method!
