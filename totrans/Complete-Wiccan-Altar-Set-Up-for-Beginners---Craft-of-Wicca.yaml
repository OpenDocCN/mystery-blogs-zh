    or quite elaborate. There is not going to be one setup that works for every person.
  prefs: []

    to you. The more you personalize it, the better it will be.

    see a full accumulation of experiences. Your attention can wander to whatever
    is most important at the moment.

    to be flexible, and they constantly change the elements depending on season, day,
    or purpose.

    well. There are subtle differences in uses between a shrine and altar, but you
    shouldn’t worry about this in the basic setup.

    Understanding the purpose will help you make the right choices for your altar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The altar is probably the most misrepresented aspect of Wicca in popular culture.
    It’s common to see discussion of Satan worship or blood sacrifice.

    who don’t even believe in any gods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    into whatever ritual, incantation, spell, or meditation you wish to perform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    having an altar can help focus your intent and make for a more positive and rewarding
    experience.

    be hefty desks that stay in place permanently or light, small tables to be moved
    daily.

    primary color involved. If it’s a purification ritual, you can use white. If it’s
    a love spell, use red, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don’t like to do this. Instead, I’ll use something closer to a runner down
    the middle. It provides the color, but it doesn’t completely cover the natural
    beauty of the wood or stone you’ve chosen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    like candles or bowls or crystals.

    can otherwise become stale.
  prefs: []

    or a sprig of herbs freshly picked from a garden.

    Early on, I used a bonsai tree when I didn’t have something else suitable.

    You can use a [sage smudge stick](https://amzn.to/2UkovsG) for a purification
    ritual or [sandalwood](https://amzn.to/2XJdaEH) for grounding before a tarot reading.

    smoky methods of scent. You could use fragrance oils or even a simple candle for
    the scent.

    difficult.

    symbols for air like wands or bells. A bell can even be incorporated into the
    ritual as the opening and closing moments.

    do a spell. You’ll need to add the spell ingredients to the altar, usually at
    the front, nearest to you.
  prefs: []

    to incorporate more focus into a spell. You can add wood specifically to the purpose
    and channel energy through it.

    decorative, but if the handle has symbols carved into it, these can also enhance
    a spell.
