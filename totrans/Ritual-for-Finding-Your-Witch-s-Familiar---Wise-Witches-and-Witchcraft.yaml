    are participating in the myth. And since myth is a projection of the depth wisdom
    of the psyche, by participating in a ritual, participating in the myth, you are
    being, as it were, put in accord with that wisdom, which is the wisdom that is
    inherent within you anyhow. Your consciousness is being reminded of the wisdom
    of your own life. I think ritual is terribly important.”

- en: A Witch’s familiar is a living animal that becomes a spiritual ally for the
    practitioner. Common familiars include cats, dogs, birds, lizards, and fish. If
    you do not have a familiar and wish to establish this kind of close relationship
    with an animal, this ritual sends out a request for one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This invitation should not be made without thought. A familiar isn’t merely
    a “pet”. The animal becomes an intimate part of your heart and soul, and works
    with you in magickal processes. Be ready for a real investment of time and effort
    when making the initial connection and also also for nurturing that relationship
    over time.

- en: Look through some nature magazines that include all kinds of animals. What you
    get as a familiar can prove surprising, so try to release yourself from expectations.
    Just because you’re a “dog person” doesn’t mean your familiar will be a dog. When
    the call goes out, it goes to all elements, and when the right creature receives
    your message, it will appear.

- en: Next, to prepare for the ritual, place small tokens that somehow honor the elemental
    energy represented. For example, before Fire put some burning incense; before
    Earth, some rich soil; before Water, a cup of spring water; and before Air, a
    feather. In the center of your space have one white candle burning to represent
    Spirit.

    in as much detail as possible. See the doorway, the neighborhood, and anything
    that could be considered a nearby landmark. This is especially important if your
    familiar turns out to be a stray creature-this will help it find your doorway.

    your eyes and ears open for that animal friend to make itself known in the days,
    weeks, and months ahead. If a long time (over six months) goes by without seeing
    manifestation, redo this ritual and send out a second call. Your familiar will
    appear when the time is right.
