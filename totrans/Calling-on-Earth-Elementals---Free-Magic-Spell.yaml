    believe, Elementals I want to see'' however many times feels right for you and
    have belief and respect for nature. If you were to do this with other types of
    Elementals you'd do the same except with a colored candle that represents that
    type of Elemental and elements that's of that type of Element as well as an alter
    of that Elemental üíñ

    I assume, but you can not make spiritual beings physically manifest before your
    eyes.

- en: Tadashi, why are you on this site if you don't believe any of it? And elements
    are like water, fire wind, and earth. (maybe things like moon if ya wanna add)
    but there is some truth to faries, just like lots of things. They might not be
    tiny creatures with wings, they can even look like gremlin trolls.

- en: I love how people assume I do not believe in anything simply because I disagree
    with nonsense spells. If you read my profile, you would see I do believe in Magic
    and I am Wiccan. I also work with The Fae, and I know they are nothing like the
    happy friendly creatures popularized today. Elementals are spiritual representations
    of the elements, but this spell does not explain what the author meant. The traditional
    ones are air, fire, water and earth, but it can also include wood, metal, plasma,
    void, spirit and countless others based on specific paths and personal belief.
    This spell also uses the claims of seeing the elementals and summoning them, which
    leads me to conclude they are claiming you say this chant and a flaming salamander
    appears, or a sprite made of water starts prancing around. The spirits are not
    physical, so if one is expecting it to physically appear before them, it will
    not work. This spell also appears rather incomplete, so as is, I do not believe
    it will work as it claims.
