- en: In humankind’s earliest histories we find accounts of people trusting that certain
    stones could heal or be used as talismans. Other stones were kept as treasured
    heirlooms or given as tokens of love. And, of course, some stones were gathered
    and used for divination – the ancient metaphysical art of gathering information
    and perspectives about our present and future that are elusive by any other means.

- en: The formal term for divining with stones is Pessomany. The Celts in particular
    seemed to enjoy this method, and often carried divinatory stones for good fortune.
    The Welsh were likewise enamored of stone readings, using yellow, white, and black
    stones for castings. The Stone Oracle you’re creating here builds on this foundation
    and goes a little further by offering ideas for improving the overall diversity
    of interpretations this system can provide.

    Each crystal is a small piece of Gaia housing hundreds of years of history and

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You now have another decision to make. Are you going to use your crystals by
    laying them out like a Tarot Deck or casting them as you might Runes. Layouts
    have two disadvantages. First, you can subconsciously come to recognize stones
    by their shape when drawing out the crystals. This recognition hampers randomness
    and can easily skew a reading. Please keep this in mind and perhaps endeavor to
    get stones that are very similarly shaped and sized. Second, if you have round
    stones they don’t have “reversals” like Tarot cards. Mind you, some readers only
    use upright interpretations for the Tarot, so you may not find this hinders your
    efforts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Castings are far less complex. Start by having the querent pick out one stone
    that represents himself/herself. Place this in the center point of your casting
    cloth. Give the querent the stones and have them focus on a question or situation.
    Finally, when they feel like the stones have “warmed up” they sprinkle them over
    the surface. If a stone lands outside the border of the cloth, it is not included
    in your reading.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or water with a hint of lemon juice to remove any residual energy.

    a battery). To accomplish this put the stones in direct sunlight and moonlight
    for an equal amount of time. The sunlight saturates the set with conscious, logical
    thought which is necessary for presenting the information in a reading positively.
    The moonlight provides psychism and intuition, which is so necessary to doing
    any type of reading.

    which is as unique as a fingerprint, meaning the stones will respond best to your
    touch.
