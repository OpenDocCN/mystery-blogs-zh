- en: The purpose of this spell is to summon part of the essence of the powerful primordial
    being Bahamut into a target, altering them irrevocably and turning them into an
    almost-immortal warrior. However, this spell has serious effects upon the human
    mind and more often than not drives the target into insanity, transforming them
    into naught but a vassal of Bahamut itself. Be warned. Below is the original text
    of this spell, taken from the Matrix of Shebosk and translated into English. The
    annotations in parentheses are merely my own clarifications of the spell's finer
    points.

    \ the need for a minion of unsurpassed strength and power, with the vigor and\
    \ endurance of the greatest soldier melded to the obedient mind of a vassal. The\
    \ creation of such a being is possible and indeed has been done before many times\
    \ in the past. The offspring of the following spell will be of the greatest breed\
    \ of warrior known yet to man. It will have the strength of thirty fine oxen and\
    \ the speed of a bird in flight, and will know not death\x92s embrace despite\
    \ the wounds inflicted on it. The Children of Bahamut may be killed again and\
    \ again, but again and again they shall rise, made by their anger even more powerful\

    to live a life most wretched and cursed, as though it may not die it must live
    with its pain until the end of time. And indeed the mind of the Spawn may be shattered,
    though its body will repair despite all punishment. So before this spell is used,
    consider ye, wise soul, the fate of your creation and if ye find pity in your
    heart turn back now.

    (note that the text is very unspecific here. It does not actually list the type
    of pentacle you need, but a different, though slightly inferior, transcription
    of this spell states that only a simple inverse pentacle is required.) in the
    sanctified ointment that drips from thy holy candle. Then, using still the same
    divine ink, mark on his chest the symbol of Bahamut, the greatest of the Dark
    Primordials (The symbol referred to here is simply an ouroboros).

    \ works here as long as all are in the same language. Considering Bahamut\x92\
    s origin, Babylonian may be a good choice.) Once the runes are placed, touch each\
    \ again in turn, while speaking its name aloud."

    \ up this mortal shell as a vessel for thy power. Meet the mind within with thy\
    \ own and merge thy energies with this link to the natural world. Consume, empower,\

    now separate Bahamut from the chosen host. This may be done using any form of
    power, but may indeed destroy the attempting sorcerer. If the connection is cut
    in time, the man into which Bahamut was summoned will be man no more, but a hybrid
    or unsurpassed power. If the attempt to break the connection fails, thou and the
    host shall both be consumed by the forces of the Warp.

    the new Child of Bahamut, as it shall greatly exceed thee in physical power if
    not magical and must be persuaded to serve rather than destroy.
