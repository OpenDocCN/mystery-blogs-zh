    Kandor is the capital of Krypton in the Superman comics. Given the inaccurate
    names that one is to call upon, it is unlikely that this spell is going to do
    anything that might be considered accurate.

- en: The names are relating to a fictional world, however the spell does work for
    me. It has told (not actually) me that I have a weak fire magic affinity. True,
    because I always struggle with fire magic.

  prefs: []

- en: Since the people you call upon are not actual deities or spiritual beings I
    doubt this spell works. If you wish to attune with the element of fire you could
    try meditating by an open flame, a candle or fireplace works, but you can also
    use a heat lamp or video of a fire. You should also research what fire is associated
    with and do activists associated with it while reflecting on fire. I have heard
    some do HIIT training, wearing red, or eating spicy food while reflecting on the
    fire element, just some examples.
