- en: Chiron in the natal chart shows us our deepest, darkest wounds. Chiron in Sagittarius
    is an especially tricky placement because it’s all about our beliefs and our sense
    of meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost any Chiron placement is impossible to escape. Unlike Saturn, Chiron will
    show up over and over, because Chiron isn’t a restriction but is instead a wound
    that needs healing. The only way you’ll notice it is if the wound is right in
    your face.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because our Chiron signs can make our lives *so* painful, I recommend figuring
    yours out and working on it as soon as possible. All Chiron signs have some really
    great qualities if we’re able to work through the pain of the wound.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Chiron in Sagittarius wound is a trauma to your belief and sense of meaning.
    You have been wounded (in a past life or in childhood) in a way that makes it
    *really* difficult for you to truly believe in anything.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though you’re probably very good at *logically* thinking about beliefs,
    you might feel like you’re on a never-ending search to actually discover your
    own. Nothing ever feels permanent; you just don’t know what the *purpose* of life
    really is, no matter how hard you try.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Chiron in Sagittarius wound is all about disconnection. You feel disconnected
    from your beliefs, yet you don’t even know what they really are. You just can’t
    figure out what it “all means.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might feel like life is totally meaningless and pointless, or instead you
    may *think* there is a “point” to life, but you just can’t figure out what it
    is.

- en: The Chiron in Sagittarius wound can show up in a lot of different ways (depending
    on the house, the aspects, and the rest of your chart), but there are a few key
    pointers that you’ll usually see in anyone’s chart with this placement.
  prefs: []

- en: '*This can manifest in a few different ways.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the first scenario, you might avoid thinking about a higher power. You feel
    that life is meaningless and you just can’t find purpose in any of it, so you
    choose to simply ignore it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may shut off a part of your nature in order to stop “big picture thinking”
    from happening. You may also feel bitter that there “isn’t” anything out there.
    This is the atheist who is angry at God for *not existing.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you go to *any* lengths in order to find meaning. You might rely
    on others for answers and information, but you can never really use the information
    that you *do* get constructively. You might feel like nothing assimilates for
    you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, these people spend their entire lives searching for the answer. Other
    times, they become fanatical about religion or other belief systems, even though
    they don’t feel that any one system answers all of their questions deep down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that people with Chiron in Sagittarius typically don’t like to be boxed
    in or tied down, especially in the area of the house that Chiron sits in. This
    is usually because they already feel boxed in by the “meaning” of life, so they
    can’t handle any more restrictions from outside sources.

- en: Where Does The Chiron In Sagittarius Wound Come From?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, the Chiron in Sagittarius wound comes from a past life trauma that
    caused you to *stop* believing in whatever it is you felt passionately about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This could be quite literally any kind of trauma. Whatever happened to you,
    the key issue is that you *thought* that the trauma happened because God, the
    Universe, or your belief system in general wasn’t there for you. You felt that
    you were left alone, so it must not be real.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you might have been *taught* during your childhood that there
    is nothing out there or that you can’t rely on beliefs or religion. You might
    have searched for something without ever finding it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To heal Chiron in Sagittarius, you must first recognize that you’re searching
    for meaning through philosophy or religion, when really what you seek is a connection
    with your Higher Self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrary to the title, your Higher Self isn’t far away and above, but within
    you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You struggle to assimilate your beliefs not because belief systems aren’t real,
    but because the pieces of your own self are not yet assimilated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I recommend that you work on assimilating yourself through Inner Child and Higher
    Self work. You have many different parts of you that feel separate but can come
    together with a bit of work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing that may help is to recognize that life is a *journey.* Our
    purpose on Earth is not to reach a destination, but to continue to learn until
    we grow old.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if your Chiron takes you on a lifelong journey to find out what *is* real
    out there, it’s okay. Learning to recognize that the journey is beautiful will
    help you to accept your Chiron while you work on your trauma.
