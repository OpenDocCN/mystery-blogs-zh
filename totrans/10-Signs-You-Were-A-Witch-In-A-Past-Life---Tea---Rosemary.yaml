    in a past life. If you feel that you were then you should trust your intuition,

    these witches, you’ll have a strong reaction if you were a witch in a past life.
    This doesn’t necessarily mean that you were a witch in that specific area, but
    it simply means you’re interested in the way of life due to a past connection.

    believe it exists. If you found that this fear existed in a strong way during

    of a fear from a past life as a witch.
