  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All spells have to potential to backfire, but you are making a direct statement
    so there's less of a chance. Just be aware the good and bad that comes from it,
    yes you will be healthy, but you give up things you once enjoyed [not just junk
    food, sometimes friends and family can try to sabotage you to stay in the unhealthy
    lifestyle because they don't wish to grow]

- en: 'My question is: Does the spell have to be done at a certain time of night?
    If so, when? Thank you in advance.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some choose to perform a spell at certain times, on certain days, during certain
    moon phases, etc because they feel it adds increased potency to the spell. However,
    you can cast a spell whenever you need to.
  prefs: []

- en: What do you mean by need? And knowledge of what?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It means you must have a requirement for the spell, something you want it to
    achieve. Then you must have the knowledge to undertake the working, usually a
    good foundation of knowledge that teaches basic principles that assist in successful
    workings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can't you just say no consequences on your wish go pretty much override the
    backfire thing? Also, can you do this more than once?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No, backfires happen for many reasons, just saying ''no consequences'' won't
    override this, you still have the potential for a backfire. With most spells you
    can do more than once, often people will repeat the same working over several
    months to continue the energy.
