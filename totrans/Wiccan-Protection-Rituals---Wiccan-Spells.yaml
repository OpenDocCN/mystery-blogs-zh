  zh: Wiccan保护仪式保证绝对安全。
- en: Another misconception about Wiccan protection rituals is that they offer absolute
    safety and protection from all harm. While these rituals can create an energetic
    shield and increase one’s sense of security, they do not guarantee complete immunity
    from all negative experiences. Wiccan protection rituals are intended to provide
    support, guidance, and a sense of empowerment, but they should not replace common
    sense, responsible actions, or professional support when needed.
