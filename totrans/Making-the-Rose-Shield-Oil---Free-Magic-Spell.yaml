- en: One of the best ways to create your protective shield is through meditation.
    Saying a prayer, spell, lighting a candle and sprinkling a little potion around
    your home and yourself can also aid in the support of your efforts. The following
    is a simple recipe for a protection oil called The Rose Shield.

- en: It is best not to use hybrid roses as their molecular structure has been altered
    to produce color. Use the standard white, red and pink rose varieties instead.
    Or if you can, wild roses are the best. ** A coffee filter can be used in place
    of cheese cloth.

- en: You want to have a small rhyme ready to chant over the ingredients as you mix
    them together. This is a method of charging the items as you combine them and
    set the intent of the potion. Your rhyme should be short, about 4 lines long and
    easy to remember and say. This is a protection potion, so your rhyme should address
    that intent.
