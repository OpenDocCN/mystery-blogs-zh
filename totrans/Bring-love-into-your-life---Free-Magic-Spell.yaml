- en: By now you should have 9 knots in your cord-like material, so set it aside.
    Next, you'll grab your piece of paper and write down "I will bring love into my
    life" or other similar affirmations 9 times while chanting the phrase as you write
    it. Roll up your paper like a scroll, and tie your cord-like material around it.
    In each of the consecutive nights, cut off/untie a knot and repeat an affirmation,
    one at a time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the night of the full moon, you cut off/untie the last knot and repeat one last affirmation.
    Put both the paper and the cord-like material either under your pillow or in another
    safe place. The following morning, cut the paper into 9 pieces and bury the two
    materials in the ground outside, finalizing the effects of the spell. Results
    should manifest themselves over the following moon cycle/month, although it could
    happen much sooner or later.
