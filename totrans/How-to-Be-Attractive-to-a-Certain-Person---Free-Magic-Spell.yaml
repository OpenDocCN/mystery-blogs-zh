- en: I highly doubt this works. It is possible to create a beauty or love charm and
    specify it so it attracts a specific person, but you will not trap them or bind
    them to you. They still have free will. A love/beauty charm would make the person
    notice you and be fonder towards you. If you do not try to speak with them, or
    find common interests, the spell will fail. Also, saying something in Latin, or
    any language, does not make it stronger. You need to know what you are saying
    so you can focus on the spell, and not pronouncing the words correctly. Historically,
    Latin was utilized by the clergy and witches began using it as a way to ''get
    back'' at the church. It does not mean the spell is better if in Latin. Say it
    in your native language. It is your confidence behind the words that matters.
