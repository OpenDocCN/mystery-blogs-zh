    on the planet except the arctic. It has beautiful trumpet-shaped flowers that
    open at irregular times during the evening. The fruits are covered in spikes and
    oval-shaped. If bruised, any part of the plant will produce a foul odor. Datura
    is extremely toxic when ingested and can cause severe hallucinations and even
    death.**'

- en: Botanical experts have different theories on whether Datura stramonium was known
    in pre-colonial Europe. According to Thomas Hatsis, three species of Datura were
    known to have existed in the old world prior to colonial contact. Hatsis further
    states that one pre-Christain name for the plant is the Lithuanian *dievažolynis, *meaning “God’s herb”.(1)

    The plants of the Solanaceae family have been used as hallucinogenics in both
    hemispheres of the planet. A Datura drug is generally made by dropping the pulverized
    seeds into a fermented drink or by steeping the leaves and twigs in water.

- en: The effects of ingesting Datura are characterized by initial effects that are
    often so violet that physical restrain must be imposed. Thereafter hallucinations
    and drowsiness can be expected. Natural philosophers like Giambattista Della Porta
    declared that datura “will make one mad, and present strange visions, both pleasant
    and horrible.” Recreational consumption has also lead to fatal tragedies, for
    example in the USA in 1994, two boys, aged sixteen and seventeen died after consuming a
    drink brewed from the roots of Datura.

    to cure skin ailments, impotency, glaucoma, heart disorders, urinary problems,
    and asthma. Datura is also known to have been used as an anesthetic during childbirth
    and surgery since ancient times. A poultice made from the crushed seeds and roots
    and applied to the joints is also thought to relieve the pain of arthritis and
    rheumatism.

- en: Aboriginal peoples from Columbia to Chile value Datura as a ritualistic hallucinogen
    and medicine. The plant was extremely sacred to the Aztec people. According to
    Richard Evans Schultes “datura has been used traditionally during initiation rituals,
    to induce dreams, communicate with the ancestors and gain occult powers and predict
    the future.”(2). Schultes further writes that “some Indians of the Andes of southern
    Columbia cultivate a number of clones or high ‘atrophied’ varieties of Datura.
    The medicine men from these regions maintain that these plants have a differing
    potency from the usual *Datura’s*“. This further illustrates that Datura inhabits
    a culturally significant and longstanding place within traditional folk medicine.

- en: Another example of Datura being used ritualistically can be found in the traditions
    of the Algonquin Indians of Eastern North America. Young men of the tribe would
    be taken to a secluded area to drink a mixture called wysoccan (made primarily
    from Datura). This powerful hallucinogen was intended to remove memories of childhood
    and was administered over a period of 20 days. Surviving this ordeal was understood
    as a rite of passage, marking the transition from childhood to adulthood.

    suggest a cure for insomnia by placing datura leaves into a shoe and setting the
    shoe underneath the bed with the toes pointing towards the nearest wall. Work
    with the dried leaves to remove negative energies and to banish fear. Invoke the
    spirit of the plant to guide you in the dream world.

- en: The leaves and fruits are considered holy within the Hindu religion and Datura
    plays an important role within Hindu mythology. The Datura plant is believed to
    have appeared from the chest of Lord Shiva and both the flowers and the leaves
    are offered to Shiva. Although Datura is poisonous, Shiva accepts them because
    he can tolerate them. According to legend, Shiva took a toxic poison named “Halahal”
    which came out of the ocean when it was churned by gods and devils. This story
    of Hindu mythology says that Shiva took that poison to save the world and kept
    it in his throat. It made his throat blue. After this, the Datura plant appeared
    from Shiva’s chest. Therefore it is believed that offering Datura to Shiva has
    a symbolic meaning and will help to remove poison, envy and rivalery.

- en: As detailed by the paper “Acute poisoning due to ingestion of Datura stramonium”,
    treatment for Datura poisoning consists of “gastric decontamination with activated
    charcoal administered by mouth or tube, sedation with benzodiazepines to control
    agitation, and the hyperpyrexia control (fluids administration and internal and
    external cooling methods). Gastric emptying and decontamination are necessary
    managing tools if they are initiated early. In our case, the ingestion was done
    2 hours before admission, and the early gastric emptying and decontamination,
    with activated charcoal through a gastric tube proved to be safe and efficient,
    as long as the airway was already secured, and the maneuver was applied before
    the toxins were totally absorbed. Decreased gastrointestinal motility may have
    raised the efficacy of the activated charcoal”.
