- en: A simple spell to ensure that no one figures out about your magickal practice.
    This won't make you invisible but can make sure they don't walk in on important
    rituals. It'll make sure they don't find your book of shadows and altar, along
    with any other magickal items, but it won't make them invisible. The spell will
    also help them believe believable lies you tell them if they do somehow find some
    magickal item or book like tarots or something else.
