- en: To start the spell, you need to recall how happy you and your ex were during
    your relationship and when you are full of the warm, nostalgic glow you should
    light the candle. In the flame of the candle, you should see the feelings you
    and the other person had for each other. At this point, you need to clasp the
    beans in your hand see them filling with these feelings.

  zh: 要开始咒语，你需要回忆你和前任在一起时有多快乐，当你充满温暖怀旧的感觉时，点燃蜡烛。在蜡烛的火焰中，你应该看到你和对方对彼此的感情。此时，你需要握住豆子，看着它们充满这些感情。
- en: 'Once the beans are full, you should place them in the bowl and move this clockwise
    above the flame of the candle. When doing this, you should take care to not burn
    yourself. The beans are the catalyst that will bring you and your ex back together.
    As you do this, you should say these words or something similar:'
