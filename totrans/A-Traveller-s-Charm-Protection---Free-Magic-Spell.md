## Casting Instructions for 'A Traveller's Charm/Protection'

For those like me who travel frequently, and hate it when it goes into turbulence-the plane, then this is the perfect working.
It is not really a spell, and you must be able to work the runes well.
(This ÂspellÂ was not taken from anywhere. I came up with it.
Note that it does actually work too, as the flights coming and going where two of the smoothest flights I have ever had, and I have been travelling since I was three years old.)

The runes that are needed are Kenaz, and Raidho.
Kenaz is used to guide the person in light on their travels and protect them,
Raidho is said to give the traveller charm.
The runes are easy enough to vibrate.
Even though the Kabalah is Egyptian in origin, the words pronounced are pronounced in German.
TheyÂre easy enough to pronounce as the German language is close enough to the English/American English language.
Each letter must be vibrated.
As Thoth once said ÂIn the beginning was the wordÂ, meaning-the power is in the words.

Work yourself into a light trance whilst focusing your attention on the plane, if possible, or if you know what the plane you are flying on looks like, visualise it in your mind.
Those who do not know what a trance feels like, everything goes quiet and more often than not you feel slightly cold.
You are only aware of yourself and the silence inside of you, keep the vision of the plane inside your mind.
When this has been done then visualise the plane in gold energy.
Coat every corner and area of the plane in it. I say to use gold, because gold is the strongest colour, it also protects and brings the person using it good luck.
FatherÂs aura is gold. Affirm the energy that it is to protect you, and to give you a smooth flight, take off, and landing.
It helps to visualise and cleanse yourself with the gold energy too.

Then take hold of Kenaz and Raidho (if you are uncomfortable with closing your eyes in a crowded place, you can keep them open so long as you can keep yourself in a trance like this) vibrate them in your mind, or you can mutter them.
People will probably not care or not be interested in what you are doing so it doesnÂt matter either way.
Personally I vibrated them in my mind because I was sat there on my own and did not want to look as though I was even more insane than what I already am.
Those who are vibrating them in your minds, visualise the image that is on the rune. For example Kensaz you would visualise the Â
