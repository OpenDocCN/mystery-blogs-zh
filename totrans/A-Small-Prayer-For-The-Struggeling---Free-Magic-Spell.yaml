    the slip up and lay the religious charm or symbol on top on it. Place your item
    in front of you and get in your position of prayer(close your eyes!) Now chant
    5x in a loud voice "From the wings and downy of a Angel Of Light and Healing Bring
    me my wish, My one true need for that I shall be healed and blessed by the lord
    above! Amen/Mote it be." After you have said this without slipping up imagine
    a ball of white light growing in your chest and protecting you with it's warming
    light.

- en: This leans towards Christian crisis of faith more than any faith. This might
    work for some, but I doubt it would work for most. Meditate, pray, soul search,
    journal, nature walks, study religions, talking to a spiritual leader, these things
    can help with a crisis of faith. If you want to ask God for direction, this works
    too, but this spell will not instantly work for everyone. Take time to look inward
    as well as ask the divine for guidance.
