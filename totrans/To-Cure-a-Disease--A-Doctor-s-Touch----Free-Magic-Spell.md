# To Cure a Disease [A Doctor's Touch]

A quick latin incantation with a strange throat-touch that will have SCP fans reeling away from you. Bonus points if you hum ''I am the cure'' eeriely, then message me with the reaction.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   -An ability to speak and/or have verbal thoughts.

*   -A limb/digit/object to poke a body part with.

*   -A subject with a, preferably minor, illness.

## Casting Instructions for 'To Cure a Disease [A Doctor's Touch]'

 The simple form of this, that I myself have used often when getting a cold or flu, quite easy. Sadly not as easy as just swatting the patient in the throat. 

   Prepare yourself by discerning what the illness is. For instance, a cold may be less energy-intensive than an infected wound, but due to its nature is likely to re-adapt and attempt another infection. Once you understand what you're dealing with, pool a fair amount of energy in your hand. I personally use my index and middle finger, but I do not see why you cannot use your palm, or the webbing of your thumb if you want to go full spook. Simply anywhere you'd be comfortable holding a ball of energy roughly the size of a baseball, at least.
   That exact energy type can vary. I myself prefer to use an electric blue akin to a gas flame to burn the disease from the inside out, but a cooler blue may work to freeze it out, and a darker crimson red may kick natural systems into overdrive. I have not experimented with the rainbow. Once you have a nice ball of energy resting on your chosen delivery system (look at me sounding doctory) you're ready to hand it over.
   At this point, you want to begin with a hum in your throat/chest, raising it to a volume you can speak through. Once you can speak, hum the Latin phrase "**Remedium morbo**", or "The cure for the disease", if my already shoddy babblefish mind hasn't failed me yet. With this line, prompt the energy you hold to become active, a roiling, feral version of what you had made. Glowing, bold, tearing through itself looking for its prey - the illness. Then, touch the center of the disease. For, say, a nasal infection that may end up being a boop on the bridge of the nose. In my experience, for something more chest-and-head centered, a touch to the throat suffices. 

   If you're unsure of exactly where to touch, or you're pulling a discreet heal, I'd recommend touching any 'blood zone', or any part of the body where blood rises close to the skin either by necessity​ ​​​​​​or to cool off. The back of the neck, either vein/artery in the neck, the insides of the elbows/knees, wrists/Achilles​ ​​​​​​tendons, so on. Blood carries illness, after all, so it can carry our cure as well. If you are, indeed, trying to be discreet, humming Latin at your target may ruin that discretion. Thus, humming it before hand so you remember the tone, and 'replaying' that humming-voice in your mind ought to be a suitable replacement for the verbal 'lets go' signal.

   Extra notes- 
   Remedium morbo is pronounced as it looks (Reh-med-eum m-or-bo), and as it means either "The cure for the disease", or "A cure for a disease", I'm not entirely sure how it will fare when fighting against multiple illnesses at once. Logically, more energy should offset the numbers/power difference. Then again, many things aren't logical. 
   For a patient throwing a fit, I'd recommend a blend of lavender and spearmint put into a sachet or other "Here, smell this" item. Similarly, if you or your germophobe friend aren't comfortable with touching each other (I cannot phrase that better without sounding like a stuck-up, posh ninny) then oregano oil is not only a helpful delivery mechanism, in which you'd pool your energy rather than your hand, but helps by lending its own boost to the immune system. I, personally, use oregano-infused-coconut oil. But hey, you know what oil you like to drink.
   I had not considered this, originally, but there is nothing stopping you from forming the cure into it's ball, forming a nice, dense membrane around it like the gelatin-glycerin wall of a capsule, or the wall of an oversized cell, and chucking it at your patient. In hindsight, there may have been a reason for me saying "roughly the size of a baseball"

[If anyone has a suggestion or what have you that they'd like me to chuck onto this/experiment with, I will gladly consider doing so. If it's a complaint about my speech, I apologize, I am not the person you want to talk to medical things about. If you can figure out what creature I had in mind, originally, while starting to do this a month or so ago, points to you.]

woo, first spell up. naptime~
