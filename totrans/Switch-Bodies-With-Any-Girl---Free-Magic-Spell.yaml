  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A book of shadows is an individual magickal journal for a practitioner. You
    can use notebooks, ring binders or fancy leather books. They can be found online,
    but made by the practitioner, it is unusual for anyone to sell their personal
    book of shadows.

- en: If you're expecting an ancient spell book with ''real spells'' that's not what
    a book of shadows is. As HearthWirch explained it's basically a witches personal
    journal where they write down terms, spells, moon phases, successful castings,
    rituals, dreams, and anything else that would help them on their personal path.
    It can be a notebook, a word document, or a hand made journal with leather binding
    and crystals attached to the cover. Whatever works for you really. What it isn't
    however is some enchanted book with spells like levitation or teleportation, gifted
    to a witch by an ancient master on a dirt road at midnight [or whatever else pop
    culture has lead one to believe] if you are lucky you might be gifted one by another
    witch in your family, but you can always start the tradition yourself [i hope
    to make a nice one to pass on one day myself]

- en: Okay, so I can really use anything that resembles a notebook? Cool. Thanks for
    the help. Also, do any of you know if this spell actually works or not? Or if
    there's a spell out there that's like this but temporary (basically where you
    switch places with someone for as long you like, then go back when you are done)
    and can be used multiple times? Anyways, again for the help.
