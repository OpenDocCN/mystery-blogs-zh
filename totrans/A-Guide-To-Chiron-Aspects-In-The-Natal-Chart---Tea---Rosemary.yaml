    there is no exception.
  prefs: []

    but it can also be helpful to have your Chiron aspected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An aspected Chiron gives you an avenue through which you can start to heal your
    Chiron.

    involves learning to exert your will. Without an aspect, you would simply be stuck.
  prefs: []

    really be felt (3-4 degrees), but I *do* know of a few people who have a Chiron
    aspect that is over 8 degrees and they certainly feel the aspect.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have the sun conjunct Chiron aspect, your pain and wound is related to
    your self-expression. You may feel as though you have to hide your true self.
    This is especially apparent in the house that the conjunction sits in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might not have enough self-confidence to go after what you want or to achieve
    your goals with sun conjunct Chiron. It can take almost a whole lifetime to heal
    this wound, but it’s well worth it!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that the sun conjunct Chiron wound often stems directly from the relationship
    with the father. Sometimes the father created this wound, and other times he simply
    made the wound that already existed more painful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless, you probably had a very distressing relationship with your father
    or male authority figure. You didn’t get the love and acceptance that you needed.
    As a child, you might have craved attention or to be noticed, but this wasn’t
    given to you, either.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the worst, you might have been humiliated or denied by your father.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look to the house that your sun conjunct Chiron aspect is in to see where you
    experienced these traumas the most in childhood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the sun conjunct Chiron aspect in the 12th house could mean that
    the father was missing, absent, or emotionally unavailable, while the 3rd house
    could mean that you were never heard or listened to; you had no voice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on the sign/element that both planets sit in as well as the house.
  prefs: []

- en: You probably react in some way when the sun conjunct Chiron aspect is triggered.
    You may react outwardly and hurt others through anger or words (more common with
    fire signs) or retreat and beat yourself up mentally (more common with water signs).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One gift with the sun conjunct Chiron aspect is that you have great potential
    to understand suffering around you. Because suffering is *so* inherent to who
    you are and is something that you experience almost daily through your sun sign,
    you can easily spot someone else in pain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    truly kind people, especially as they continue to work through some of the pain
    of the Chironic wound.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have the sun conjunct Chiron aspect, you need to work on your low self-confidence.
    Try to put yourself out there and go after what you want; you will gain self-confidence
    slowly through action.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might lack the masculine push that makes your sun truly shine. This is regardless
    of your gender, for we all have both masculine and feminine within us. The sun
    is typically masculine because it is bright and active, but your sun might feel
    dimmed because of this aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Self-expression and creativity are the keys to igniting the power of your sun
    sign. You must learn how to be yourself, unapologetically, without fear of the
    father or of re-triggering the wound.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, you probably will re-trigger the wound as you work through these issues,
    but this is actually beneficial to help. It is only by triggering your Chiron
    that you can begin to deal with it and gain self-confidence *even though* you
    experience pain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this wound did stem from your relationship with your father, or even if he
    simply re-triggered the wound from a past life, you may need to realize that he
    will never accept you in the way you want. You can still heal your wound by learning
    to understand your father and forgive him.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much of this sun conjunct Chiron wound revolves around understanding that the
    past cannot be undone and that bad things happened to you so that you could learn.
    Now, it is time to discover how to accept *yourself* and eventually, rejection
    from others will no longer hurt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also find that some people with sun conjunct Chiron reject the masculine side
    of themselves in an attempt to reject the father, *or* they overemphasize the
    masculine side in order to gain his approval.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The healing path here is to determine what is *authentically* masculine about
    you (we *all* have parts of us that are authentically masculine) and to embrace
    those pieces of yourself rather than try to fabricate new ones.

    related to the mother or the main caretaker during early childhood. This can manifest
    in a few different ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and play out her role without meaning to, even if you know it wasn’t for her best
    interest.
  prefs: []

    from your mother and experience her pain from your own point of view rather than
    hers. You also need to form your own beliefs about what you wound means instead
    of using hers.
  prefs: []

    the inner child and give your child what they didn’t get when you were actually
    little.

    on some dimension, so simply ignoring them isn’t an option. You won’t be able
