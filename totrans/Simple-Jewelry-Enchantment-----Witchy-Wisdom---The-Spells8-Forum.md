# Simple Jewelry Enchantment üíç - Witchy Wisdom - The Spells8 Forum

> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://spells8.com/simple-jewelry-enchantment/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/simple-jewelry-enchantment/#0001-01-01)

Every full moon, I try to do a refresh on my jewelry enchantment for my pentacle. **So, I figured I would share it with you, too!**

### What‚Äôs the purpose?

Enchanting jewelry is a very common practice that witches partake in. You can enchant rings, necklaces, bracelets - any form of jewelry - for any purpose. This enchantment was created to bring the spirit and energy of each element into my necklace to carry with me throughout the day.

## What You‚Äôll Need

You will need the following. Please note that these are my own correspondences for the elements. If you have your own, feel free to substitute and change with your beliefs.

*   Salt to represent Earth
*   Incense to represent Air
*   A white pillar candle to represent Fire
*   A bowl of Moon Water to represent Water
*   A pentacle to represent Spirit
*   A piece of jewelry

## Instructions

### Create Your Sacred Space

You can do this in any way you‚Äôre comfortable. Some people cast circles, but I create a sacred space by sitting and meditating, then saying the following‚Ä¶

*This is a sacred space. Only those that are invited are welcome. I call on the spirits and energies of the five elements -Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. I ask you to be here today and aid me in my work."*

### Bless the Jewelry with the Elements - Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit

Place your jewelry in or around each element. Then call upon the energy of that element and ask it to bless and charge your jewelry. I don‚Äôt always have something written particularly for this. I go with what first comes to my mind because my witchcraft is very intuitive.

Here is an example of what I said for Earth.

*By the power of Earth, this jewelry is cleansed. Spirit of Earth, I call to you. Imbue this necklace with your stability and your rock foundation so that I may have stability and a solid foundation in my life.*

When you‚Äôre finished with your spell, conclude it in your normal fashion. Since I don‚Äôt cast circles, I simply thank the elements and energies for showing up to be with me and I make sure they all get an offering as thanks.
