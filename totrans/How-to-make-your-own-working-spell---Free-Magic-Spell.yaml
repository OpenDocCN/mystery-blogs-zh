    a peice of paper, write what spell you are wanting to make, write down ingredients
    that would enhance the spell, and then write a short poem about the spell. Make
    sure you have Mote it be in the poem. Then, fold it in half, and draw a pentagram.
    Then, whatever ingredients you chose, you need to have with you. Then say the
    short poem with the ingredients you've selected.

- en: Bare bones explanation. Begin by deciding what you want to achieve with the
    spell. If you have a preference of spell type such as candle or potion, choose
    the process you wish to use. The next step is research. If you wish to cast a
    friendship spell, research herbs, colour, crystals, whatever you wish to use that
    has friendship energy. For you first spell, less is more. Stick to three to five
    items so you are not overwhelmed and you do not muddy the energy since items have
    multiple energies to them. If you wish to say a chant, write one, but it is not
    required. Once complete, journal about how you feel before the spell, then cast,
    journal how you felt during and after the casting, and finally, keep record of
    anything you sense for the month following the casting. That way you can see how
    well it worked and if you need to edit anything for future casting.
