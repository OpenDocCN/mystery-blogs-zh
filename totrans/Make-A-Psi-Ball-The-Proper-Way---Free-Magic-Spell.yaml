    it, or what you are going to do with it.

    of energy, cause a psychic attack, bring happiness, strength, or you can even
    make it rain, sunny, windy, or manifest something, use it as a wish spell, etc.
    There is so much you can do with a psi ball! And the good thing about energy balls,
    is that you don't need candles or herbs or crystals, however, if candles, herbs,
    crystals, etc make you concentrate, than use them if you wish! Use a candle if
    you are especially connected with the element of fire.

    by the name Skye. She''s amazing, and she''s the one that wrote this technique,
    so I am taking NO CREDIT. I think this is some pretty important information, so
    I wanted to share it! Here you go:'

    however, if you are using the energy for a purpose, it's best to take from the
    Universe. The Universe is far beyond what we humans can take from it, so don't
    feel bad about taking it! The Universe is full of raw, loving, positive energy.
    It's meant to be used!

    technically is a form of meditation. Hold your arms and hands up as if you are
    holding a ball. Hold your hands apart by about 2 inches or so. If anything, Think
    of it like Goku performing a Kamehameha Wave. It''s similar. In fact, if you''d
    rather, there''s TONS of videos on YouTube about making energy balls, if you need
    a visual! To use your own energy, which I actually do more often: Close your eyes
    and imagine either-- --Your energy flowing through your body like your blood.'

    Then, imagine it going up and out your arms' length, into your palms and fingers,
    and out into the space in between. Imagine it forming into a ball shape (it can
    be anything, but they're not call balls for nothing).

    either-- --White light coming from the Universe, down to your body, through the
    top of your head, through your arms, into your hands. OR --Golden light coming
    up through the floor like vines, wrapping around your legs, slowly progressing
    up your legs, into your body, up and out your hands, into your hands.'

- en: If you wish to make the ball bigger, slowly spread your hands farther apart,
    while keeping focus on the ball. Going back and forth slowly and lightly, as if
    trying to press your hands together, should allow you to feel the ball. You should
    feel a sort of force or pressure...like energy is there.

- en: If you wish to make the ball denser, same thing...Except, slowly bring your
    hands closer together to push the ball into a smaller shape. In both cases, you
    may add more energy as you wish. How much goes into it, its shape, its size -
    all depends on you

    lift your hands and release the ball, like you're releasing a bird to fly. The
    energy will disperse into the air. Open your eyes and that's it!

- en: If you wish to use the ball for something, you must first Shell it. To do this,
    imagine more energy going around the ball, creating a casing/shell/shield, once
    you feel your ball is complete. Doing this will give the ball a "solid" outside,
    keeping the energy held together. That way, once it's released, it will not disperse.

    with the intention in mind (ex: you want to heal someone, so you focus your energy
    in a healing nature, put in healing energy) OR --You may wait til the ball is
    complete and shelled. Before releasing it, you may either think intently on what
    you want it to do, or physically tell it what to do. Keep the intention there
    until you feel the ball "understands" the programming. OR you may do both, if
    you want to be super sure.'

    its job. It happens. And it's alright! Failure happens. It's a learning experience.
    No shame in it.
