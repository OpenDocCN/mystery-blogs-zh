- en: One of the most beautiful aspects of Wicca comes from the Wiccan Rede. There
    are many names for this, including the Wiccan Law or Rule of Three. Wicca is unlike
    the monotheistic religions of the West. It doesn’t seek to control or force limited
    ways of living through sets of ancient rules.

- en: The only absolute of Wicca is to do no harm. There is freedom in your craft
    and practice. You may worship how you please or not worship at all if you wish.
    The many facets of how Wicca is expressed is one of the highest achievements of
    humankind.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We won’t go through the whole thing line-by-line, but let’s focus on some of
    the key parts that will give us the best overall understanding and breakdown of
    the Wiccan Rede and Law.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, the Rule of Three is mentioned in the line “Mind the Threefold
    Law ye should – Three times bad an’ three times good.” This is the fundamental
    concept underlying everything. Magic is powerful, and one should not abuse it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The punishment is not going to be something to do with the afterlife. It will
    come in while you’re alive. If you try to curse someone, you will be cursed three
    times worse. Do no harm sounds like an altruistic sentiment, but in reality, it
    is also selfish.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spend your time with the craft trying to good in the world and make the world
    a better place. Not only is it the morally right way to live, but it is also going
    to benefit you greatly in the long run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people don’t believe in the Rule of Three because it can take time for
    things to come back around. But when they do, you’re going to wish you believed
    it. But as long as you harm no one, you may do as you wish. There aren’t silly
    extra rules like don’t wear clothes that contain fibers of different types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other fundamental ideas make their way into the Wiccan Rede like the casting
    of the circle for protection in the line “Cast the Circle thrice about To keep
    all evil spirits out.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is always a good practice any time you wish to work the craft of Wicca.
    Start with a basic cleansing ritual and circle of protection. This way the local
    energy is pure and nothing evil seeps into a perfectly benign spell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last point I’d like to mention is “When misfortune is enow, Wear the Blue
    Star on thy brow.” This can be confusing to some. But it’s fairly simple. The
    Blue Star on thy brow is just a reference to your third eye. When you run into
    trouble, turn inward. Meditate and seek spiritual guidance on how to continue
    past a temporary period of misfortune.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lots of solitary practitioners like to make their own alternate version of the
    Wiccan Rede. This is a great idea! As I always say, everything in Wicca is personal.
    The more personal you make it, the stronger it will resonate with your energy
    and work better.
