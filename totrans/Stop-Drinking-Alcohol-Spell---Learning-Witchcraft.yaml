    from the spell to stop smoking. As it is a banishing spell, this is best when
    performed either during either a waning or new moon. Disclaimer: If you happen
    to be physically addicted to alcohol, you should never attempt to quit without
    talking to your doctor. Quitting alcohol cold turkey can be dangerous to your
    health.'

    then meditating for a few minutes until feeling calm and clear minded. Gather
    all pieces of paper and pick one up, reading aloud. Affirm the opposite of it,

    Imagine being a non-drinker and rejoicing in how happy, healthy and free that
    you feel without this habit. Put each piece of paper that you have been holding
    onto into that empty bottle of your favorite alcohol.

    is in the bottle. Put on the lid. Tie your black cord around the neck of the bottle,
    securing it with three knots. Take your glass of water and imagine there being
    a beautiful beaming light inside it. Drink your water slowly, feeling the light
    going into your body and throughout with each sip, purifying you and also blessing
    you.

    as it circulates around your body, getting stronger and stronger, then flowing
    into and through the amethyst. Then, imagine the crystal with the light energy
    and pulsing. Sit with the meditation for a few minutes until you have your intuition
    telling you that you are now done.

    If you start to feel as though you have to drink alcohol, you can drink a glass
    of water and then repeat the visualization as before.
