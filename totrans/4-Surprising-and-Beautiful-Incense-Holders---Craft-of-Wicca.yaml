    there are not worth it. If you’re interested in making your own incense from kitchen
    scraps, I wrote a [DIY Wicca article](https://craftofwicca.com/diy-wicca-making-incense/)

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before getting into the recommendations, let’s cover some of the common questions
    people have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are incense holders called?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the catholic tradition, incense holders are called **censers** or **thuribles**.
    This usually only refers to a holder that is an enclosed vessel dangling from
    a chain in which loose incense is burned on coals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most cases, especially in Wicca, we just refer to them as incense holders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '### What kind of incense holder is best?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best incense holder will depend on what you want to use it for. Stick, loose,
    and cone incense will each have a different type of holder that is best.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using a stick, any type that keeps the stick off the ground will work.
    Usually, you will want something open rather than enclosed for stick incense.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For cone incense, any holder that cannot catch on fire will work. Since cone
    incense is similar to stick, it is also common to have an open container as these
    burn slowly and regularly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For loose incense, you will want a material that can withstand high heat. It
    is common to use a brass holder, but glass or ceramic works well too. Loose incense
    is usually burned in an enclosed container because it emits more smoke.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '### What are the holes in an incense box for?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The holes in an incense box are there simply to let out the aroma from the burning
    incense inside. The holes on the bottom of an incense holder are there to hold
    solid sticks of incense. There are sometimes multiple holes because people like
    to burn more than one stick at a time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you close the incense box?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there is a lid, then yes, close the box! The scent will come out of the holes.
    If there are no holes, then you should not close the box. Not only will this trap
    the scent inside, but the box will fill with carbon dioxide and snuff out the
    burning incense.

- en: This ceramic incense holder is known as a “backflow” incense holder. This means
    that the smoke flows in reverse through it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The backflow incense holder is a ceramic incense holder that is designed to
    prevent incense from spilling out of the holder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The holder has a small hole in the top that allows the incense to flow out,
    but prevents it from flowing back in. This design is often used in Buddhist ceremonies,
    as it is believed to help keep the space clean and free from negative energy.

    so it can come across as slightly cheaper than the mountain river holder above.

    holder creates a waterfall of incense smoke that cascades down into a basin below.

    the smoke to flow at the bottom instead of the top.
