# Protection onto an Enchanted Object

This spell is to be used in conjuction with Aura Shield and an enchanting spell.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Protection onto an Enchanted Object'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   An enchanted object

*   Your body

*   Your energy

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   An enchanted object

*   Your body

*   Your energy

Ok, so, this spell is really just going to allow you to have a non-draining protection spell that blocks almost all magic-based attacks. First off, you going to want to either be holding the item that is enchanted or wearing it. Then, for the first layer, you have to write with your finger (on your skin) your magic symbol. Then, you must say
''Protect me, and mote be it!'' (Simple, i Know) You must imagine your energies flowing into the mark. You should feel a heady feeling come over you and a warm wave pass through your body. Hopefully your energy is doing ok at this point, but everyone is different. Next, cast Aura Shield with at least 3 layers. Then, imagine both the aura shield and the Protection spell (CAN BE CAST ON ANYTHING, BUT THIS SPELL REQUIRES IT TO BE CAST ON YOU!) gradually draining from you into the item. You'll have to do this every time you deactivate the shields. Then, imagine a lock sealing the spell shut so that it only can be opened when the user says a word you specify (I use ''Protect'') Whenever you wish to activate the protection, say the word and the shield will spread across your body and be maintained by the enchanted object. With practice, the shield will slide on an off faster and you'll enventually only have to think the word.
