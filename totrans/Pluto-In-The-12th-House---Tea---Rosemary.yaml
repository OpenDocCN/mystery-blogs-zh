    but other people probably don’t see this when they first meet you.

    to others. With this placement, you probably come off as easy going and relaxed

    doing this work is emotionally draining.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Pluto in the 12th house, you may have a lot of deep-seated fear that you
    aren’t “good enough” in some way. Often, this fear isn’t even conscious, it’s
    just a mindset that you live with on a daily basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, much of this placement has to do with the idea that you feel inherently
    unlovable. Your mind is your enemy in some ways, because it perpetuates this myth
    that there is something wrong with you. When you try to slow down and listen to
    your mind, all of these fears and self-doubt rises to the surface and may overwhelm
    you.

    darkness that’s out there. These people struggle to figure out where they fit

    else they belong.

    you feel that you can be alone.

    emotional or obsessive and you may have been bullied or ridiculed because of your
    emotions.
  prefs: []

    be seen as weak. You bottle up your emotions and never show the world how you
    truly feel, but this does nothing to help you *solve* the problems within your
    mind.
  prefs: []
