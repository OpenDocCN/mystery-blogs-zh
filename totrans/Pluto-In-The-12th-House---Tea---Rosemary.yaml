    to others. With this placement, you probably come off as easy going and relaxed
    when you remember to put on your “game face,” but your unconscious movements can
    be very intense, agitated, or aggressive, which often confuses others.

    unlovable. Your mind is your enemy in some ways, because it perpetuates this myth

    your mind, all of these fears and self-doubt rises to the surface and may overwhelm
    you.
