 Cast a magic circle around the intended plant, using a magic wand or knife. If you do not work with those ritual tools, consider a respectful way to demarcate the harvest space. Request permission to gather the plant from Apollo and his son Asklepios, the plant's presiding spirits.

Burn incense and make offerings to the spirits. Offer a libation to the plant, and then gather it.

What on earth does this do? Since this was taken from Judika Illes Encyclopedia of 5000 spells, I will look it up for clarification. (top of page 30) This is not a spell, it is better classified as a ritual or spiritual rite. There are several harvest spells listed on page 30 of the book from various cultures. This is a way to honour the plant spirit if you follow a Hellenic path. This is literally word for work plagiarized from the book, but it should be fleshed out more and given a better explanation. The spell book begins with an explanation of how the spells work and how to cast spells. This section also has an explanation of what the harvest spells are used for. This is why the spells are such barebones guides. It is for the experienced Witch to flip to the specific section, read the spell recipe and then do it including are the necessary steps required for a successful spell. This specific *spell* is used when harvesting plants for a spiritual purpose. You are giving thanks to the plant you are harvesting so the item you took is not tainted with negative energy because you stole from the plant. As mentioned, this would be the Hellenic (Greek) way of giving thanks to the plant spirit. If this resonates with you, use it. I would say every harvest ritual that is meant to thank the plant for allowing you to harvest what you need follows the same process. Approach the plant, introduce yourself, ask permission, wait for a response, leave offering. The only difference I see is you call on a Greek deity. I would suggest using rosemary incense, cypress incense, or another herb that is sacred in Hellenic Witchcraft.

TL:DR of my comment, this works but do some research on Apollo, Hellenic Witchcraft and meditation first.
