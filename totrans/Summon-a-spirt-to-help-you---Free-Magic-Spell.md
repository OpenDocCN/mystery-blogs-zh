Right before you go to bed light the candle and cup your hand around the flame. In your other hand have the wand (If you don't have a candle do the samething but there will be no flame) Close you eyes and while chanting this slowly raise your hands upwards (Chant 3-10 times):

Spirt I summon you to my dream and my life,
show me my path and my outcome
I welcome you in hopes for help,
I cry out to you.
Tell me my future and help me through it.
sprit of good I summon you to follow and lead me
night and day be by me, and show me the way
So mote it be!

After that blow out the candle and go to bed it may not work right awat but do this everynight until she/he comes.
