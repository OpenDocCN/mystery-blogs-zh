Lay down in a comfortable position, preferably on your stomach. Concentrate on who you are. See your body before you. Slowly, a white, foamy liquid is melting you away... Who are you? Inquire a lot. Imagine your tail. Feel it. Wag it. Do solely this for five minutes.

You are a dog. Act like one for 15 minutes. Think slow, joyful thoughts for 6 minutes, then bark. After a while, it will be realistic sounding. You WILL look like a dog. Slowly does it. Every day for a week, do this exercise. Remember: focus on your mind right now- a dog, not your human body afterwards.

This is NOT a physical shift. Just enjoy having a dog brain!

It claims to be mental, and it might work for some, but this transformation is all in your head. Do not go around acting like a dog, that is not the point of mental shifting. Mental shifting allows you to view things from other perspectives.
