    Earth, rather all the elements, Earth is the grounding of the three other elemental
    forces. You should see the pentagram as an electric blue colour- like the coulour
    on a gas hob.

    God name "YHVH", sound the letters out "Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh." See the blue colour
    intensify- note you should see tthe pentagrams suspended in infinite space of
    which you are the centre they are always surrounding you as you have constructed
    your inner universe.

    (clockwise) and draw another pentagram. This time vibrate "Adonai (ah-dohn-eye).

- en: This ritual is used to banish unwanted energy before and after every working
    and to set up a sacred space in which you can do your rites. The angel forms I
    use are not the most used, nor accepted, I feel they do have the most basic elemental
    symbolism necessary and therefore are more suitable for beginners.

- en: A lot of people believe the final god name is AGLA, however this is a notariqon
    (A qabalistic anacronym.), and I and many others, believe the original teaching
    was to vibrate it in full, as shown above.
