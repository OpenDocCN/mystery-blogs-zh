    not Minecraft. Imagine your getting sucked into the game. Say this spell with
    your eyes closed and sit into a meditation position: gods and goddesses, suck
    me into Minecraft. I want to build, I want to explore and I want to find treasures.
    Gods and goddesses, hear my plea, suck me into Minecraft so mote it be! Then you
    should sit there for about 3-5 minuets with your eyes still closed and visualize
    that your getting sucked into the game. Open your eyes after the 5 minuets and
    look around you. Your in Minecraft! Congrats and be careful and think about the
    times when you played Minecraft and got killed a million times. Be careful and
    be blessed. Hope it works but it might not cause this is a spell I wanted you
    to try.'
