- en: If only this were possible, sadly a spell will not make you fluent in multiple
    languages in a short period of time. This *could* set your intention to learn
    one language. This *could* help you retain the language easier and master it quicker,
    but you need to be realistic and put in effort to learn. If you wish to be fluent
    in a week, you are in for a let down. If you want to be fluent in a month, you
    might learn enough to have a conversation if you spend most of your time studying.
    Give it a try, but be aware you will still need to regularly practice the language
    in order for this spell to work. I only see it working by increasing your ability
    to retain new information.
