- en: This formula, from A`yû'ninïs' book, is for the purpose of driving away a witch
    from the house of a sick person, and opens up a most interesting chapter of Cherokee
    beliefs. The witch is supposed to go about chiefly under cover of darkness, and
    hence is called sûnnâ'yï edâ'hï, ''the night goer.'' This is the term in common
    use; but there are a number of formulistic expressions to designate a witch, one
    of which, u'ya igawa'stï, occurs in the body of the formula and may be rendered
    ''the imprecator,'' i. e., the sayer of evil things or curses. As the counteracting
    of a deadly spell always results in the death of its author, the formula is stated
    to be not merely to drive away the wizard, but to kill him, or, according to the
    formulistic expression, ''to shorten him (his life) on this side.''

- en: When it becomes known that a man is dangerously sick the witches front far and
    near gather invisibly about his house after nightfall to worry him and even force
    their way in to his bedside unless prevented by the presence of a more powerful
    shaman within the house. They annoy the sick man and thus hasten his death by
    stamping upon the roof and beating upon the sides of the house; and if they can
    manage to get inside they raise up the dying sufferer from the bed and let him
    fall again or even drag him out upon the floor. The object of the witch in doing
    this is to prolong his term of years by adding to his own life as much as he can
    take from that of the sick man. Thus it is that a witch who is successful in these
    practices lives to be very old. Without going into extended details, it may be
    sufficient to state that the one most dreaded, alike by the friends of the sick
    man and by the lesser witches, is the Kâ'lana-ayeli'skï or Raven Mocker, so called
    because he flies through the air at night in a shape of fire, uttering sounds
    like the harsh croak of a raven.

    is evidently a mistake in regard to the Red Man, who is here placed in the north,
    instead of in the east, as it should be. The reference to the arrows will be explained
    further on. Purple, mentioned in the second paragraph, has nearly the same symbolic
    meaning as blue, viz: Trouble, vexation and defeat; hence the Purple Man is called
    upon to frustrate the designs of the witch.'

- en: To drive away the witch the shaman first prepares four sharpened sticks, which
    he drives down into the ground outside the house at each of the four corners,
    leaving the pointed ends projecting upward and outward. Then, about noontime he
    gets ready the Tsâl-agayû'nlï or ''Old Tobacco'' (Nicotiana rustica), with which
    he fills his pipe, repeating this formula during the operation, after which he
    wraps the pipe thus filled in a black cloth. This sacred tobacco is smoked only
    for this purpose. He then goes out into the forest, and returns just before dark,
    about which time the witch may be expected to put in an appearance. Lighting his
    pipe, he goes slowly around the house, puffing the smoke in the direction of every
    trail by which the witch might be. able to approach, and probably repeating the
    same or another formula the while. He then goes into the house and awaits results.
    When the witch approaches under cover of the darkness, whether in his own proper
    shape or in the form of some animal, the sharpened stick on that side of the house
    shoots up into the air and comes down like an arrow upon his head, inflicting
    such a wound as proves fatal within seven days. This explains the words of the
    formula, ''We have prepared your arrows for the soul of the Imprecator. He has
    them lying along the path''. A`yû'ninï said nothing about the use of the sharpened
    sticks in this connection, mentioning only the tobacco, but the ceremony, as here
    described, is the one ordinarily used. When wounded the witch utters a groan which
    is heard by those listening inside the house, even at the distance of half a mile.
    No one knows certainly who the witch is until a day or two afterward, when some
    old man or woman, perhaps in a remote settlement, is suddenly seized with a mysterious
    illness and before seven clays elapse is dead.
