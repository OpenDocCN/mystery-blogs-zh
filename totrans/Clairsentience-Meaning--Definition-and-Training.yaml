- en: Clairsentience meaning, as the term suggests, refers to clear sensing or feeling.
    It's an incredible psychic ability that allows individuals to receive intuitive
    messages through feelings, sensations, and emotional experiences. We could also
    call it emotional knowledge. Sounds cool, right? Imagine walking into a room and
    being able to sense the energy and emotions that are present there. So, let's
    dive deeper into what is clairsentience and clairsentient meaning.

    information about people, places, objects or events that isn't available through
    the traditional five senses.

- en: But wait, there's more! The clairsentience meaning extends beyond just emotions
    and feelings. So, what is clairsentient? It can also include **physical sensations**
    like a sudden chill, feeling a touch when no one is near, or **even a change in
    temperature**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, as to the question of what is a **clairsentient**, you may perceive energy
    and vibrations subconsciously, receive psychic messages through emotions rather
    than seeing images or hearing voices, and sense emotional undertones around people,
    places, or things.

- en: 'Beyond our clairsentient definition, identifying**clairsentience** within oneself
    can be tricky. In order to define clairsentient, we have to truly understand,
    through experience, and ask ourselves: "what does clairsentience mean?" Often,
    people with this psychic ability may unknowingly use it throughout their lives
    without realizing it. They may experience**immediate feelings or physical reactions**
    to certain circumstances, changing their mood or causing discomfort.'

    having more awareness and, thus, sensitivity towards your feelings and the energy
    around you. Pay close attention to the physical sensations in your body and the
    emotions that arise in different situations.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clairsentience is like an **amplified version of intuition**. While everyone
    experiences gut feelings occasionally, clairsentients constantly experience **emotional
    pangs of intuition**. This psychic sense can often lead to strong reactions to
    different forms of energy.

    YES!
  prefs:

    It starts with acknowledging your feelings and intuitions as valid information
    rather than dismissing them.

- en: 'So now that we have our definition of clairsentience, if we take apart the
    word, we find clair (clear) and sentience (feeling). Just like the other clair
    abilities: clairvoyance (clear seeing), clairaudience (clear hearing), claircognizance
    (clear knowing), clairgustance (clear taste), and clairalience (clear smell).
    While clairsentients and empaths share the ability to feel and absorb the emotions
    of others, there is a distinction between the two. **Clairsentients not only absorb
    emotions but also derive insights from these feelings. **They can perceive the
    emotional state of places, objects, or intangible energy with their clairsentient
    abilities.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An empath, on the other hand, absorbs emotions without necessarily understanding
    them. They might not be able to infer information or predict outcomes based on
    their empathetic reading of a situation.

- en: While clairsentience is about deriving answers and clarity through feelings
    and emotions, being claircognizant is another clair that loosely translates as
    "clear-knowing," and is about **having logical, factual knowledge separate from
    emotions**. It's possible to possess both these psychic senses, although each
    clair often manifests at different times and one usually precedes the other.

- en: Practices like astrology and tarot can benefit from clairsentience. When synthesizing
    a birth chart or conducting a tarot reading, clairsentients can feel whether the
    interpretation is correct.

    It allows you to immediately sense whether something feels good or bad. However,

    have to guess until you find an answer that feels right.
