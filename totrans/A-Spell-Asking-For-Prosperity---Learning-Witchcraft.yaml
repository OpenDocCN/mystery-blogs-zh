    in its holder. Take the oil and pour some in your hands and then rub them together
    so they start feeling warm. While you are rubbing, think of yourself as charging
    your hands with the oil’s energy. Take the oil and anoint the inscribed candle
    with it. Draw in from the center and back towards you. Once again, visualize that
    you are empowering your candle with the power of drawing prosperity towards you.
    Roll your candle in between your hands for a few minutes, and return it to its
    holder and light it. Keep your attention focused on the flame and say the following:'
