- en: First have a seat. The circle of stones should be in front of you. Now you chant
    your water(you can make up your own spell for that,it doesn't have to be rhymed)and
    make it holly. Then you add the sugar and the salt and the half lemon and you
    put a spoon in the cup and mix it all up, then put the soda in (Not the whole
    pacage but a little).Then you mix it up again. You say the spell and then you
    drink the potion (It's not poisonous). Remmember this first you chant spell than
    you drink the potion.

- en: What do you mean by ''soda'' exactly? Baking soda, or soda water? Either way,
    the mixture is harmless, though it probably will not taste very good. It will
    not take away the feelings of fear and shame permanently, but I can see it helping
    if you are trying to overcome a situation, or work through these emotions.
