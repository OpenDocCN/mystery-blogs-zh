- en: This is known as a counter spell, or the kind of spell that can break any spell
    that may have gotten cast on you. It is always best to cast this during a waning
    moon. While it is not completely necessary, a lot of people consider a waning
    moon spell to be double the power as a spell that is cast at any other time.

    seeing yourself from the influence. Stare right into the flame, keeping the visualization.

    the spell for you, allowing you to know it is so. Should the spell seem to be
    placed on you again, you can simply go through and repeat this same spell as outlined.
