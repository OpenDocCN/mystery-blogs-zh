Place Green candle in the Center of the Pentagram (if being used) otherwise, place it anywhere. Set up your incense stick anywhere in your bathroom.

Next thing you do, Light the insence, and light the Candle. Take the sea salt, give thanks to Mother Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Spirit Chant:

"Bless this Sea Salt, Bless this Bath, Cleanse my body of all negative Energies, Heal my spirit and renew it, Blessed Be."

Envision a glowing light around the sea salt, go over to your bathtub and sprinkle the salt all throught your bath water saying: "Bless this bath, Bless my spirit, Blessed Be." and while doing so, envision a light all around your bath water.

Step in, relax, medittate if you wish, submerge your entire body in the water and enjoy your bath. Once you have finished, you should feel relaxed, full of energy and cleansed of all negative energy.
