- en: It may at times seem as if you are being singled out for unfair treatment over
    the next 12 months but it’s the universe’s way of challenging you to do more and
    do better. Your potential is unlimited and the more you are pushed the more you
    will achieve.

    yourself sick about it. You should know by now that every challenge brings with
    it a potential solution, so stay alert and be ready to act the moment you see
    it.

- en: Some people always seem so negative – it’s part of their nature – but you don’t
    have to listen to them and you certainly don’t have to do what they tell you.
    The only advice that matters is what your inner voice tells you – and it’s telling
    you to smile.

    work and keep your mind occupied. The less you think about what went wrong the
    less likely it is you will beat yourself up about it. Look to the future.

    favors and if you expect it to just hand you what it is you desire you will most
    likely be disappointed. Your life is in your own hands – do something with it.

    tell you how unlikely that is. You are at your most vulnerable when you feel so
    absurdly over-confident, so tone down your expectations while keeping your guard
    up!

    Don’t listen to those who urge caution, they don’t possess your levels of energy
    and enthusiasm, still less your self-belief. You know in your bones it can be
    done.

- en: Before you start something new, be it a project, a hobby or even a relationship,
    ask yourself how much it might cost in the long-term. And don’t just think in
    financial terms. If loved ones don’t agree with your aims there could be an emotional
    cost too.

    outcome, so give it time to develop and don’t be tempted to pull the plug before
    you know for sure where it is taking you. You could be headed somewhere good.

    if it’s really worth the effort. If someone you try to help today gives you a
    hard time it might be best to back off and let them suffer. You can’t help everyone.

    those you are talking too. Maybe you are trying too hard. Maybe you should try
    using smaller words so they can easily understand. Not everyone has your big brain.

- en: Honesty is by far the best policy, so don’t be tempted to say things you know
    are untrue just to please other people. You may think of it as an act of kindness
    but in fact you are doing them no favors at all. They need to know the truth.

    taking place right now that isn’t going to happen. Get your mind used to the idea
    of change, because real changes (good ones) will be taking place in your life
    very soon.
