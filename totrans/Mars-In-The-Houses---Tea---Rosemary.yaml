  zh: 问题的关键是，有了第十二宫中的火星，你最终会为他人的斗争而战，而不是为自己的斗争而战。你在自己和他人之间感到不断地拉扯，经常感到内疚感困扰着你。以某种方式，你会自我破坏，因为你无法处理潜意识中酝酿的所有消极情绪。
- en: With Mars in the 12th house, your anger can be displaced. You may get angry
    at someone who doesn’t deserve it or blow up over something inconsequential. The
    anger will show up where it doesn’t belong because you are like a pressure cooker
    and need to release it somehow.

  zh: 或许你觉得任何为了被看到或被听到而做出的努力都是徒劳无功，所以你干脆不试了。你没有自信相信自己应得到想要的东西，所以你宁愿*给予*别人，而不是要求自己需要的。
- en: 'When you feel overwhelmed, you may be a bit of an escapist, turning to drugs,
    alcohol, sex, or even experiences that give you a “high.” You’re inclined to jump
    ship and run away when your emotions begin flooding you. It’s common for people
    with Mars in the 12th house to think: “What’s the point?”'

    comes naturally, but learning to assert yourself will make you feel much more

- en: Sexually, you may have some issues. You are drawn towards the unattainable person,
    but when you’re suddenly with someone who actually is attainable, you don’t know
    how to unlock your emotions and be vulnerable. You can come off as closed-off
    or detached.

    you learn more about your subconscious mind, you won’t be able to access those
    feelings with someone else (which is even more terrifying).
