Has anyone done this and does it work? I need a spirit that is around my spouse to go away.

you could use this chant if you wish, but you would need more than simply chanting. look into cleansings [examples: spray saltwater around your home, burn sage or light a white candle] visualize your home becoming purified then say this chant. after casting, be sure to protect your home and spouse to prevent it from returning [they should also have a cleansing bath]

Just ask it to go away in the name of jesus. It will go away. Tell it it's not welcome in your home.
