Hold your amethyst in your hands and visualize it being filled with positive energy and intentions. You can also say a simple affirmation or prayer to help focus your intentions.
*   **Moonlight**: Placing your amethyst under the light of the full moon is another powerful way to charge it with energy. The full moon is a time of heightened energy and can help to cleanse and charge your amethyst. Be sure to place your amethyst in a safe and secure location outside, and bring it back in before sunrise to prevent damage or theft.
*   **Sound**: Sound vibrations can also be used to charge your amethyst. Place your amethyst on a singing bowl or another instrument that produces sound vibrations, and play it for several minutes. The vibrations can help to clear any negative energy from the crystal and fill it with positive energy.

By charging your amethyst regularly, you can keep it filled with positive energy and maintain its effectiveness in your spiritual practices. Choose the charging method that resonates with you the most, and be sure to set clear intentions and focus your energy as you charge your crystals.
