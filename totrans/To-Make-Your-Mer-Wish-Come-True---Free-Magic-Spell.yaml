- en: You can becoming a mermaid but not through spells... To becoming a mermaid u
    need the shifting method subliminals and spells only help u to shift but it will
    never shift u fully.. U think its impossible go on amino to the merfolk shifters
    amino or other there are so many shifter and they all will say you it's possible
    and some of them can show you proof... Don't ruin our dreams we are Mer beings
    if you don't believe it wouldn't work the key for shifting is time believe and
    cencentration if u try the shifting method u will change i swear u will get results
    really fast... For example kissing Mithnight she was one of the first mermaid
    shifters and she had Shown us her proos she has shown the world a picture of her
    prescales if her tail... So don't say it's impossible... If everything is possible
    u have only to believe...

- en: There is no proof that subliminals work at all, and they certainly don't for
    shapeshifting. It's incredibly easy to fake pictures as ''proof.'' I learned some
    basic special effects makeup through self teaching and theatre, and I could probably
    fake some scales on my legs fairly convincingly. Someone more experienced would
    likely not have difficulty in that. Photoshop could also be used. Photographs
    really aren't proof, as it's pretty feasible for someone to fake them.

- en: no, it's not possible. physical shapeshifting isn't possible with magick because
    magick cannot contradict nature. humans are part of the physical plane, and physical
    shapeshifting goes against the laws of the physical. i don't care how many photoshopped
    photos you throw out as ''proof'' if you would just allow yourself to step out
    of your bias circle for a minute and look at the facts/logic of what you claim,
    you would understand that those of us who ''ruin your dreams'' as you put it,
    are simply trying to educate and help you. it's like people who believe in a flat
    earth, global warming is a myth, or that vaccines are dangerous, if you looked
    at the overwhelming evidence instead of the one or two groups that already agree
    with you, you would see the majority of the evidence is stating the opposite is
    true. don't use belief as a shield, it's not the star in super mario bro. and
    suddenly you're invincible, belief is powerful, but not infallible [again, many
    people strongly believe global warming isn't real, but i don't see the planet
    getting cooler simply because they believe it's not getting hotter]
