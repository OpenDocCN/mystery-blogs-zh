    allows you to draw power from the Overseer, who is the one who controls the universe.
    The spell is typically used if the previous overseer''s heir can''t, for any reason,
    be the overseer, so it''s given to the second trusted member of the royalty under
    CAREFULLY WATCHED CIRCUMSTANCES. If you are not heir to the Overseer, the power
    may override your system'

    which will officially start the ritual. Cross both pairs of fingers above your
    head, then circle them around you. Once 45 degrees to your standing legs, spread
    out your hands. If successful, a large golden ring with little spokes should pulse
    from behind you (the mirror would come in handy here).

- en: The golden ring should maintain behind you. Bring your hands together into a
    clap, then rotate your arms in opposite directions until you have them completely
    spread out horizontally. Then, move your arms counterclockwise to a vertical stance,
    and then bring them together in front of you, clapping

    in power. Keep your hands clasped together for as long as you can. After about
    thirty seconds, the ring should dissapear. If you can seperate your hands without
    literally blowing up, you did it!

- en: thanks for the laugh, no spell is ''illegal'' just personally disapproved of.
    you cannot physically transform, even if you own Dragons blood and have a general
    knowledge of Dragons [heck, i should be able to transform come to think of it]
    above all, if this ''spell'' is so illegal, powerful, dangerous, and real, why
    would it be so easy to find? many groups hide advanced information from others
    for a reason, specifically the person isn't ready for whatever reason and its
    dangerous, so if this was real, and some powerful being doesn't want you using
    it, why post it openly on this website?

    illegal act in all sections of the milky way.'' Real Magic is not policed by anyone
    but yourself. Should you deem a spell ''morally wrong'' then do not cast. Otherwise,
    you can cast any working spell you desire. This is fake.
