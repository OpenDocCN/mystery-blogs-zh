    wish to try it, despite knowing it will not work, nobody is going to stop you.

    model a servitor after a pokemon and summon that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are correct. You could redesign this spell to create an energy shaped and
    programmed to be like a pokemon. Servitors need a purpose, however. So, if you
    want it to bring you joy, model it after a cute Pokemon. If it is meant to be
    a protection, a powerful Pokemon. Servitors vanish after they fulfil their purpose,
    but you can resummon them. There are other types of energy creatures, so a different
    type might work better for your intentions. Research them and try it out.
