    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [Amber](https://wiccanow.com/amber-the-gold-of-the-north/). Today
    I thought we’d focus on another beautiful “crystal”, namely Tiger’s Eye.
