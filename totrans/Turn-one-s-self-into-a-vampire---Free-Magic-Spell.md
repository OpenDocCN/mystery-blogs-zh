' Gods and Goddesses I call upon you to make me a vampire. It is what I wish to be. I wish to no longer have to eat or drink anything, only if I want to. I want to die right here on this night, but be reborn as a vampire. I call upon the spirit of the Lord vampire, make me one of your kind. I reject my soul, I give my soul to you, I want to receive the gift of the vampire. Make me feel the worst pain for I have died and been reborn as a vampire. So mote it be.'

It will feel like fire is being spread around your body. On the next full moon you will turn into a full vampire.

Good luck.
