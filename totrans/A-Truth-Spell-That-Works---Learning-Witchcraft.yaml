- en: Do you wish to know the truth about any situation? Then make use of this truth
    spell. If you require clarity for a given situation, or you are of the opinion
    that someone is possibly hiding something from you, then a truth spell may be
    the answer. This one is very simple to use, and has worked well for many other
    people. All that is required is meditation, and a [lapis lazuli gemstone](http://store.learningwitchcraft.com/lapis-lazuli-tumbled-stone-gemstone-crystal-healing-rock-1-piece/),
    which are readily available from a store, or an [online shop](http://store.learningwitchcraft.com).

    flame. Clear everything from your mind and relax until you have completely cleared
    your thoughts and relaxed your inner being.

- en: Pick up the lapis lazuli gemstone. In your mind, visualize a very bright white
    flame. Watch this flame grow to fill the whole of your vision. Hold this image
    for over a minute, and when it is as bright as it can get. Put this light inside
    the lapis lazuli gemstone. Imagine the crystal absorbing the flame, and burning
    as bright as a star in the night’s sky.

    power to show the truth. The way to reveal the truth is in your dreams. Prior
    to sleeping, place the lapis lazuli crystal under your pillow. It is not important
    to remember what you dream of, the truth will reveal itself in the form of a gut
    feeling, and your intuition. The truth will reveal itself to you, and you will
    know when it does.
