    to the potency of the spell and I think it probably scales on the strength of
    the caster. Drawing hearts and 8 doesn't seem effective and looks filmsy to me.

- en: This sounds like a plausible wish spell. Be aware of a few things regarding
    wish spells however. The larger the wish, the longer the wait. Wishes still need
    to be realistic. Wish spells are like any other spell, only you are making it
    specific to your situation. You could cast a money spell, or you could wish for
    a thousand dollars. Both work the same. Only with wish spells, the spell is usually
    more simplistic than other spells. Wish spells are more on par with manifestation.
    Focus on your desire, tell the universe you want the thing, then release the energy.
    Reading over this spell, 8 could be considered infinity, the heart could be your
    hearts desire, even gold works in wish spells, its just the red I question. Unless
    you are wishing for love or passion, it does not seem to align with the spell.
    Lastly, the chant, ignore the ''say six times'' chant until you feel the energy
    is at its peak. This could be six, it could be sixty. Whenever you feel the energy
    ready to burst, that is enough times. No harm in trying it, just be sure to charge
    everything with energy and focus on your wish as you cast this.
