# Shield of whatever needed to protect

It's an elemental shield of protection using your own elemental powers to protect you from any harm the most you can. If for example there's too much heat it'll try using water and cold available to prevent harm and balance you.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Shield of whatever needed to protect'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Focus and training over the elements, some understanding of what and how much elemental energy you have.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Focus and training over the elements, some understanding of what and how much elemental energy you have.

Meditate. Concentrate on the state of your mind and body. Try to feel what elements are being more then you need at the moment and which ones have to be empowered- are less then needed. It's common to have extra of all or most of the four basic elements, but if you feel you don't have enough of some of them, try to fix that via food, meditation or other sort of balancing.
After you're done with this part chant an universal mantra including elements on your mala or bracelet or bangle or whatever you use(it may even be chanted without any artifact if you prefer) to balance and empower your elemental powers.
Concentrate on your elemental presence and chant: Shield of the elements combined and separated, use the influence of my own(it might be different, if you don't believe in separation and individual characteristics, e.g.-ship or vessel or whatever) energy by those same elements to protect me from any harm by balancing whatever needed to accomplish harmony and wellness in every moment of my existence as it shall be.
Repeat often and you'll be protected. This shield may not give you protection from just anything, but it'll be of use against elemental harm and especially powerful against weather extremes. It ain't extremely good against extreme cold though, but it shall still have some beneficial effects to balance what's needed.
