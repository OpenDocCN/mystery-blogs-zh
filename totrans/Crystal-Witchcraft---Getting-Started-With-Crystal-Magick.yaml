- en: Hi lovelies and welcome to Wicca Now. As you may already know, Wicca Now is
    a site where Amaria and I write all about witchcraft, Wicca, crystals and magick.
    Lately, I’ve been covering a lot of crystal related content, like this post on
    [how to charge your crystals](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-charge-your-crystals-15-fantastic-tips/),
    a recipe about [how to make crystal infused water](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-make-crystal-infused-water/)
    and a post all about [crystal correspondences.](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/)
    Today I thought we’d take a broader look at crystals and magick and talk about
    crystal witchcraft.

- en: Crystals have always fascinated me and as a child, I remember asking my parents
    to buy me specific crystals that I’d had my eye on for my birthdays. I used to
    line my crystal collection up in the sun and observe how they glittered and glowed.
    Sometimes I’d carry a special crystal in my pocket and touch it throughout the
    day and I can even remember one specific crystal (a round smooth piece of tigers
    eye) that I liked to suck on like a hard-boiled piece of candy (strange as it
    may sound).

- en: What I didn’t realise at the time was that I was intuitively practising a sort
    of crystal magick. By placing the crystals in the sunlight I was cleansing and
    charging them, by touching or carrying them with me I was working with the energies
    of the crystal to help soothe or energise. It’s amazing how most of us are naturally
    inclined to do certain things as children which we need to relearn to do as adults,
    don’t you think?

    Egyptians who wore gemstone jewellery and carried amulets made from crystals to
    the Romans who named certain crystals after the qualities they were thought to
    possess.

    diverse and storied existence. Maybe the crystal you hold was passed down from
    mother to daughter for many generations, maybe it lay deep inside a fiery volcano
    for thousands of years. Perhaps it bubbled up and down with the waters of a subterranean
    hydrothermal spring or it lay buried deep under many layers of sediment and stone
    until it was mined and brought forth into the light.

    earth and whilst many people differentiate between precious and semi-precious
    crystals, for witches, all crystals are precious and unique.

    most look forward to and I can understand why. The beauty and energy embodied
    by crystals make them a wonderful starting place for rituals, energy work or spells.
    Working with crystal magick can be incredibly inspiring and enriching for your
    practice regardless of whether you are a baby witch or one with many years of
    practice under her or his metaphorical belt.

    with these frequencies forms the basis of crystal witchcraft. While there is no
    scientific evidence (yet) to confirm that crystals can directly affect our bodies
    and environments, that doesn’t mean that they don’t. Witches have worked with
    crystals for centuries and believe that by harnessing a stones specific energy,
    that they can in turn guide this energy towards a specific problem in order for
    it to then manifest a solution.

    A crystal witch is generally a witch who had decided to focus his or her craft
    primary on crystal witchcraft and crystal magick. This means that a crystal witch
    will generally possess wide-ranging knowledge about crystals and the qualities
    that each crystal enjoys. He or she might choose to work with crystals in the
    following ways:'

    Learning to become a crystal witch requires a witch to dedicate her or himself
    to truly understanding the world of crystals, something that might take years
    and years of practice. Don’t beat yourself up if you feel like you’re not ‘getting
    it’ at the start, stay persistent and keep working with the stones until their
    language begins to reveal itself to you.

- en: Many witches believe that a crystal should not be purchased without first seeing
    it in person. The reason for this is that it is easier to get a feel for a crystal
    and thereby determine if it is right for you by first holding it or by simply
    being in its presence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don’t really agree with this idea because I believe that the energy contained
    within crystals is universal and regardless of how a crystal makes it’s way to
    you, you will always be able to find a way of tapping into its frequency. Also,
    not everyone has access to a crystal shop and being able to shop for crystals
    online is a wonderful way of adding to your collection if you don’t happen to
    have a crystal shop in your neighbourhood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Either way, before purchasing a crystal you should first research what sort
    of crystal you need. If you need help discovering what crystal corresponds to
    which qualities check out this post I wrote on [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/).
  prefs: []

    crystal, a small crystal will be just as effective. You might also like to invoke
    a deity to ask for guidance when choosing a crystal. Or you might like to meditate
    on what you would like the crystal to help you with. Regardless of whether you
    are shopping for crystals in person or online, listen to your intuition and notice
    which crystal seems particularly attractive or interesting.

    witchy altars, Ameria’s actually written lots about altars like this post on [how

    in and discuss how you might like to incorporate crystals into your altar or sacred
    space.

- en: As a general rule of thumb, I don’t recommend having more than two crystals
    on your altar at any point of time unless you have a specific spell or ritual
    which calls for more. The reason for this is that you don’t want to have too many
    conflicting energies happening on your altar and placing your whole crystal collection
    on your altar would have just this effect. It’s a better practice to store your

    and [charged crystals](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-charge-your-crystals-15-fantastic-tips/)

    them within your spellwork when needed.
