    pain, and uses discipline to change the way you view that area of life. Every
    two years or so Saturn will enter a new house and bring with him a variety of
    lessons that you will need in order to move into the next phase of life.'

    Kronos, was the father of time and used his tough parenting skills to bring pain
    and suffering to his children, but ultimately made them better gods and people.

- en: Saturn also represents Karma in astrology, so whatever house Saturn transits
    often means a good deal of Karma coming from that area of life. For that year,
    Saturn will bring pain and learning to that house, and you may learn lessons you
    didn’t even know about in that year.
  prefs: []

- en: Because it takes Saturn so long to return to the same spot (roughly thirty years);
    you will experience lessons and transformations in every area of life until you
    turn 30, and then just repeat for the rest of your life. The great thing about
    Saturn transits is that we are *always learning–* and Saturn will teach the lesson
    whether you want to or not.

- en: In Astrology, the 12th house represents our unconscious mind, our past lives,
    our karma, and any imprints that we may be unknowingly carrying with us. It also
    represents hidden enemies and people from our past. The 12th house is often misunderstood
    and misinterpreted, as it can have a variety of different meanings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The 12th house is essentially just an incubator for which thoughts grow, and
    become parts of the subconscious. They are hidden from conscious awareness, but
    affect the outcome of the person’s thinking through implicit biases and other
    patterns of belief that we don’t even know we have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The 12th house is also the house of self-undoing. It is those unconscious patterns
    that haunt us, the skeletons in our closet, and the things that often lead to
    our own demise. For this reason, it may also be the house of hidden enemies.

- en: Interestingly, the 12th house is ruled by Neptune, so it is also the place of
    dreams and illusions. If someone has a natal planet in the 12th house, this planet
    likely contributes to the dreams and illusions that that person exhibits, and
    the parts of their mind that remain hidden.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In astrology, the 12th house is also that of a past life. For example, while
    moon represents the mother in most areas of astrology, someone with their moon
    in their twelfth house may actually be referring to a mother in a past life, rather
    than a current incarnation. If someone has their sun in their 12th house, it may
    indicate that their light/personality is hidden even from them– and is not always
    accessible.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, the 12th house can represent our connection to source. Because
    it is ruled by Neptune, which is an expansive planet of dreams and illusions,
    the 12th house may guide us towards divine leadership. The unconscious mind is
    the bridge to the Universe, so it is through the unconscious mind that psychism
    exists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The 12th house is the house that many people can get lost in, especially during
    transits. It is a place of introspection, a deep dive into oneself, and moving
    away from ordinary life into the connection with the universe.

    father figure, this is often like being in time out– especially as he goes into
    your 12th house. The rest of your life ceases to exist as he probes your unconscious
    mind and forces you to face yourself.
  prefs: []

    decides strategically how to bring it all to light in a way that will best teach
    you. This may often include a bit of pain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your unconscious mind is a bit messy. Saturn goes through it, and brings each
    thing that you need to address into the light one at a time. This can be a really
    hard process for people, because these things are things we *want* to keep hidden.
    They are in the 12th house because of lifetimes of repressing them, and they are
    not always things we want to have to address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    ignore them in real life they will show up in your dreams, your fears, and all
    places of your subconscious. This is not the time to shy away from learning or
    healing, he will force you to heal even if you are not ready.

    he will force you to be alone while showing you your own unconscious strength.
    He may do things to humiliate you in the ways that you are most afraid of, and
    play on your weaknesses. But it is all for the sake of the lesson.
  prefs: []

- en: Unlike other Saturn transits, Saturn Transiting the 12th house brings issues
    in every facet of life, depending on where your weakest areas are. If you have
    a lot of unconscious fears about the world around you, he will force you to face
    them by giving you responsibility and opportunity. Unlike Jupiter, Saturn does
    not give you the *option *to learn the lesson– you will whether you like it or
    not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most people do not want to face their fears. We would rather put them on the
    back burner and lead our attention and focus to the good things in life, but Saturn
    Transiting the 12th house forces us to face them. He will repeatedly bring them
    up through his 2 years in your subconscious mind until you have learned something,
    and he will leave you less afraid than you were before.

    Whatever you have focused your attention on, and whatever part of life you are
    afraid of failing in, Saturn will show you what the worst is that could happen.
    It may feel as though your world is collapsing around you.
  prefs: []

    are masking the truth. The truth being – your fears, doubts, guilts, and shame
    that is holding you back.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn likely will collapse your life in some way or another, but he never leaves
    you empty. He always leaves a house better than he entered it in, and he will
    give you the tools and foundations to build up your subconscious mind and psyche
    so you can be better than you were before.

    you have in your life, including yourself. There may be people that you have in
    your life that were not making you *the best* version of yourself, and for this
    we call them hidden enemies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who do not want you to raise your vibration, become your best self, or
    want to keep you at their level because thats what they are comfortable with are
    often losses that occur during this period. Saturn will teach you that it is okay
    to be alone, that your subconscious/unconscious mind is more than enough for you,
    and that some people are better left in the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will also be a period of returning. Because the 12th house involves past
    lives, this may be a time that Saturn plays out karmic relationships from past
    lives. You may have no idea why this is happening, especially because the 12th
    house is ruled by Neptune (so there may be some degree of confusion), but people
    may return to your life from these past lives *only to teach you lessons.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Neptune makes things feel very *meant to be*— like the stars are aligned in
    all the right ways. However, because this relationship is often bringing to the
    surface old wounds from past lives and unpaid debts between souls, Saturn is not
    setting you up for something that is *meant to b**e–* he simply aims to teach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn does not typically bring your soulmate, but rather he brings lessons
    for you to learn– so if Saturn is transiting your 12th house keep this in mind
    when meeting people. These are likely “hidden enemies” that, in a sense, bring
    you pain and suffering– but learning along the way.

    This is called the destruction phase, where Saturn removes all the masks in your
    life and makes it clear to you what unconscious beliefs you still need to work
    out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the Destruction phase of Saturn transiting the 12th house, every structure
    in your life will be tested in some way. The smallest weakness will lead to a
    complete crumble of that structure, as Saturn encourages you to dig deep and build
    more solid foundations.
  prefs: []

    from you. He will ride in on his horse, take anything that is not of *value*,
    or to your highest benefit, and remove it from your life. He will strip you of
    all patches and band-aids in your unconscious mind, and he will leave you feeling
    rather bare and empty.

    accept that everything Saturn took away from you he did *for you*, and not *to
    you*, you can begin to see why all those structures and old things in your life
    had to go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a time to start conquering the underlying reasons why you may have had
    those things in your life in the first place, and begin a deep dive into your
    subconscious and unconscious minds. I recommend therapy, journaling, or creating
    art as an outlet to all these feelings. It is important to remember your dreams
    during this part of the transit, as Neptune and Saturn meet to teach you things
    in your dreams and illusions.
