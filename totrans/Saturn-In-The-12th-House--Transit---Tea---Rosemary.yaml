- en: The 12th house is essentially just an incubator for which thoughts grow, and
    become parts of the subconscious. They are hidden from conscious awareness, but

- en: In astrology, the 12th house is also that of a past life. For example, while
    moon represents the mother in most areas of astrology, someone with their moon
    in their twelfth house may actually be referring to a mother in a past life, rather
    than a current incarnation. If someone has their sun in their 12th house, it may
    indicate that their light/personality is hidden even from them– and is not always
    accessible.

- en: Additionally, the 12th house can represent our connection to source. Because
    it is ruled by Neptune, which is an expansive planet of dreams and illusions,
    the 12th house may guide us towards divine leadership. The unconscious mind is
    the bridge to the Universe, so it is through the unconscious mind that psychism
    exists.

  zh: 此外，第12宫还代表了我们与源的联系。因为它受到海王星的影响，海王星是一个关于梦想和幻想的扩张行星，第12宫可能会引导我们走向神圣的领导。潜意识是通向宇宙的桥梁，所以正是通过潜意识存在着心灵感应。
- en: The 12th house is the house that many people can get lost in, especially during
