    Magick on the physical has different rules than magick on the astral or ethereal
    or any other plane. Physical magick is a natural, neutral energy. It's part of
    nature and ruled by nature, therefore it can't contradict nature. Magick on the
    physical brings natural change. It's neutral energy, and when we cast spells,
    we charge it with a positive or negative charge depending on our desired goal.
    Magick on the physical effects the energy around a situation, not the physical
    thing you wish to change. No amount of belief will change this fact.

- en: As I and many others have stated time and time again, Real Magik is not the
    same as the fantasy magic you see in popular culture. Real Magik that Real Witches
    cast in reality is a neutral energy. This energy on the physical plane is ruled
    by nature. It brings natural changes to our world. This natural energy does not
    defy nature on the physical plane. When we cast spells, we are tapping into this
    energy, which we call Magik (also spelled magick, majik, majick) to bring a natural
    change towards us. This energy only effects energy on the physical. It does not
    change physical objects/beings. You wish to cast a love spell? You are charging
    the energy around you to vibrate the same as the energy around the other person,
    thus attracting them to you. You wish to lose weight? You are charging the energy
    around you to attract things to you to help motivate you to achieve your goal.
    Such as loved ones who will support you, advertisements for affordable exercise
    classes, coupons for healthy meal programs. It will draw the desire to you. It
    will not transform your physical body because your physical body is not energy.
    It is solid. You were born human. You can tell yourself as much as you want that
    you are really a fish, but you will never be a fish. People with gender dysmorphia
    know they are meant to be a different gender, but no matter how deeply they know
    it to be true, they need medical intervention to change their physical. A spell
    would help by making the process easier with finding a doctor, healing, and passing,
    but it would not give them the body they were meant to have over night. This is
    the reality of Magik. Anyone who knows anything about Real Magik will tell you
    it is an energy that brings change by charging the energy around you to attract
    or repel what you hope the achieve. Anyone who says otherwise either has not studied
    Real Magik, or is trying to scam you. I suggest you do your research by reading
    books by reputable authors. Before you tell me why you cannot, you have Google,
    you can enter a book store and spend the day reading the books. You have a Library
    where you can do the same thing. You can buy books and hide them at your friends
    house. There is plenty of social media options to teach you. This website has
    a forum to help. It has articles. It has groups. While the ranking system on this
    site is flawed, we have members with ranks to inform you of their knowledge. If
    you insist on listening to the random strangers on the internet, the ones which
    are most likely aware of Real Magik would be the ones with ranks. The people who
    claim this works are unranked, with blank profiles and/or have not been on this
    site in months. The people informing you these spells are not real are established,
    knowledgeable members of this site, some of whom teach on other websites. You
    are actively choosing the false information because it supports your bias. The
    information you seek, specifically why you cannot become a vampire, is easily
    found on this site, but it does not support your belief. Go to the site forums.
    In the General Info and Other Spell Discussion sections, you will find pinned
    threads by some of the sites wisest users explaining The Basics. One of which
    is titled ''Nope, No Vampires'' and is posted by an elder of Wicca and one of
    the sites top users.

  zh: 正如我和许多其他人一次又一次地声明，真正的魔法不同于你在流行文化中看到的幻想魔法。在现实中真正女巫施放的魔法是一种中性能量。这种能量在物质层面上受自然规律支配。它给我们的世界带来自然的变化。这种自然能量不会违反物质层面上的自然规律。当我们施放咒语时，我们是在利用这种我们称之为魔法（也可拼写为magick、majik、majick）的能量，来带来对我们有利的自然变化。这种能量只影响物质上的能量。它不会改变物质对象/生物。你想施放爱情咒语吗？你是在充实你周围的能量，使之与其他人周围的能量同频，从而吸引他们到你身边。你想减肥吗？你是在充实你周围的能量，使之吸引一些事物到你身边，以帮助你达到目标。比如支持你的亲人，提供实惠的健身课程广告，健康饮食计划的优惠券。它会将愿望吸引到你身边。它不会改变你的物质身体，因为你的物质身体不是能量。它是固体的。你生来就是人类。你可以告诉自己你是鱼，但你永远不会成为鱼。性别疑惑的人知道他们应该成为不同的性别，但无论他们多么深刻地了解这一点是真实的，他们都需要医学干预来改变他们的生理。咒语可以通过帮助找到医生、治愈和变得像你的目标来使这个过程更容易进行。但它不会在一夜之间给予他们他们本应该拥有的身体。这就是魔法的现实。任何了解真正魔法的人都会告诉你，这是一种通过充实你周围的能量来带来变化的能量，以吸引或排斥你希望实现的事物。任何说其他话的人要么没有研究过真正的魔法，要么就是想骗你。我建议你通过阅读知名作者的书籍来进行研究。在你告诉我你为什么不能这样做之前，你可以用谷歌搜索，你可以进书店花一整天读书。你有一个可以做同样事情的图书馆。你可以买书然后把它们藏在朋友家里。有很多社交媒体选项可以教你。这个网站有一个论坛可以帮助你。它有文章。它有群组。虽然这个网站上的排名系统有缺陷，但我们有一些具有知识的会员可以告诉你他们的知识。如果你坚持听网上的随机陌生人，那些最有可能了解真正魔法的人会是那些有排名的人。那些声称这种方法有效的人没有排名，资料为空白，或者几个月没有登录过这个网站。那些告诉你这些咒语不真实的人是这个网站的资深、知识渊博的成员，其中一些人还在其他网站上教学。你正在积极选择错误的信息，因为它支持你的偏见。你所寻找的信息，特别是为什么你不能变成吸血鬼，很容易在这个网站上找到，但它并不支持你的信念。去网站论坛。在常规信息和其他咒语讨论部分，你会找到一些网站最明智的用户所发的置顶帖子来解释基础知识。其中之一的标题是“不，不会有吸血鬼”，这个帖子是由一位女巫长者和网站顶级用户发布的。

    can claim anything. Everyone saying it worked is lying because they either want
    to sound special or want to troll people. The people who are saying this spell
    is fake is because we know magick can't turn you into a vampire so we're trying
    to help people not waste time on something that won't work for them. We're not
    trying to discourage anyone, we're trying to help people learn magick. [look up
    any reputable author in witchcraft and they will say the exact same thing. Google
    what is magick. Go to YouTube and look for reputable channels on witchcraft] Magick
    is a natural energy that brings natural change. On the physical, it's ruled by
    nature and any spell that contradicts nature won't work because it defies natural
    law. I wish I could do some of these cool-looking spells we see in movies, but
    the reality is, that's not how magick works. The magick real-life witches cast
    are to bring subtle changes to life.

    no matter how many times someone casts a spell like this, no matter how much emotional
    effort is applied, no matter how much ''energy'' is raised, focused and released,
    it's all a waste on a fake spell. You are human and will remain as such.

- en: There's a difference between the magic you've seen in movies and the magick
    in reality. Magick [spelled with a ''k'' to differentiate the two] is a natural
    energy that brings natural change. On the physical, it's a force of nature, ruled
    by nature, and therefore can't contradict nature. When we cast spells, we focus
    this magickal energy on the desired goal and release it to attract/repel that
    change. Magick doesn't do the impossible. On the physical, it brings natural changes.
    A love spell works by affecting the natural energy fields around two people to
    attract them together [like magnets] but it's up to the individual to talk with
    the other person, get to know them, ask them out, and so on. Vampires [as in the
    Dracula type of vampire] aren't physical beings, they're astral. You can be born
    a psi vampire [you can also practice energy work and learn how to do what comes
    naturally to some] or believe your spirit was a vampire reborn in a human body
    [that would be an otherkin] but you don't say a few words and get to become Twilight
    or Interview With The Vampire type vampire. Those aren't physical creatures. Humans
    can't decide to physically transform by nature, which is why we can't cast a spell
    and physically transform into another creature [it contradicts nature and magick
    on the physical doesn't do that. Each plane of existence has different rules about
    magick]
