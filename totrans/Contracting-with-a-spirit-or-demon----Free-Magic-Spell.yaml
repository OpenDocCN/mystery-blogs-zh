- en: This spell in it's entirety takes month to complete and completion should be
    timed to the full dark moon, even so at completion you are at the mercy of the
    spirits whether your offer is accepted. Do not be naive, you are offering yourself,
    your soul as collateral, so do not use this as a way to find love or get worldly
    items you can get through hard work.

    and leave the contracts sit out overnight. This is now a valid contract until
    rejected and cannot be reneged on or destroyed.
