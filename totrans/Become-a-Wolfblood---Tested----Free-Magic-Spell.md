And hearing to locate even the quietest noise.

You cannot physically transform into a werewolf.

If we can't physically transfrom, could we get power and abilities like werewolf??

No. Magick doesn't contradict nature. Since whatever powers/abilities you attribute to werewolves would contradict human nature, you won't gain them on the physical plane. Any spell that claims you will is fake. You can call on astral werewolves or use their symbolism in your craft, but you can't gain powers.

Based on gold eyes in the night, I'm gonna assume this guy's a TVD, Originals, and Legacies fan (or at least one of the three). But no, won't work. Even if it were possible to turn into a werewolf (and unless someone's hiding some very amazing technology from human eyes), you need to be born a werewolf (according to the show. I'm just going to use the show's logic since the spell is inspired by it). No magick will change or re-write genetic code (biokinesis comes to mind, but if that actually works, you won't be able to change it back since wolf minds don't work like human minds. You won't be able to keep focus long enough to shift back anyway).

I 100% believe that if your genetics are non-human and dominant then youll eventually shift, no matter what non-human you turn out to be

I have tried it and I was disappointed

doses not work I have tried
