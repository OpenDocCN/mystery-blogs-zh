You want to cast dragon spells and dragon magick, but you’re not sure where to start. Don’t worry, we’re here to help. In this article, we will discuss the most effective dragon spells for beginners.

 Dragon spells can be used for a variety of purposes, including protection, healing, and energy work. The type of spell you choose will depend on your needs and what you are trying to achieve.

 Here are some of the most effective dragon spells for beginners.

 This is just a sampling of the many different types of dragon spells that are available. Be sure to explore all of your options and find the spell that is right for you.

 ## The Basics of Dragon Spells

 In order to cast dragon spells, you must first understand the basics of spellcasting.

To me, dragon magick boils down to understanding energy. It is almost a form of [elemental magic](https://craftofwicca.com/elemental-magic-for-beginners/).

 Dragons aren’t literally real, but all forms and concepts have energy in this world. Dragons can be thought of as a type of element to work with, except way more powerful. This is part of what makes dragon magic so appealing.

 It can also be thought of as a type of divine invocation. If you’ve ever invoked a goddess, then you should be very comfortable with dragon magick.

Spellcasting is the act of using your magical powers to influence the world around you. To cast a spell, you must first gather your energy and focus your thoughts. Then, you must project your energy toward your target and release it in the form of a spell.

 There are many different ways to cast dragon spells, but the most effective method for beginners is to use visualization.

Simply look up the dragon associated with your desired outcome, and then imagine it in as much detail as possible and allow the energy of your spell to flow through you as you conjure the energy force of that being.

 We’ll get into more details later.

 ## The Most Effective Dragon Spells

 There are many different dragon spells that can be used to achieve different goals. Some of the most effective spells are the following:

*   The Call to the Dragons of the Quarters
*   Dragon Summoning (wishing, protection, etc)
*   Elemental Dragon invocation

Remember, the most effective dragon spell will probably be the one you create. There is a lot of power in personal creative expression.

Take these as templates, research the different dragon energies, and then create a spell tailored to your needs.

 ### The Call to the Dragons of the Quarters/Elements

This is an all-purpose dragon spell/invocation that can be done a few times a year to enhance your magical practices.

 When you summon the Dragons of the Quarters, you are requesting a willing dragon to keep an eye on and direct the elemental forces connected with that quarter/direction.

At twilight create a circle of protection around you.

 When you initially cast a circle, you will most likely receive multiple different dragons standing in as Quarter Guards.

You may eventually discover that the same four dragons are answering your call every time (you’ll be able to tell by the “feel” of the energy each provides). When this occurs, you may either wait for the dragon to disclose his or her name, or you can choose a name for each one.

 Many Dragons choose to operate in this manner, accepting the moniker as a gift. In any case, at the proper quarter, change those names with the lines “One who is willing” and “Great **_** Dragon.”

 Face the correct direction and invoke:

**East:** The wonderful forces of the air have arrived from the regions of the Eastern Dragons! I summon One Who Is Willing to stand watch at the Eastern Gate. Give me supremacy over the powers of the air. Help me increase my intelligence and knowledge. Keep an eye on this circle so that anything that I do is wise! Great Eastern Dragon, hail and welcome!

**South:** The purifying force of Fire has arrived from the realms of the Dragons of the South! I summon One Who Is Willing to stand watch at the Southern Gate. Give me dominion over the Fire powers. Help me develop our free will and creativity. Keep an eye on this circle so that I can spread joy and beauty! Great Southern Dragon, hail and welcome!

 **West:** Water’s cleaning power has arrived from the regions of the Dragons of the West! I summon One Willing to Guard the Western Gate! Give me dominion over Water’s abilities. Assist me in strengthening my intuition and emotional control. Keep an eye on this circle so that I can have the guts to listen to my inner voice and act accordingly! Great Western Dragon, greet and welcome!

**North:** The sustaining power of Earth has arrived from the kingdoms of the Dragons of the North! I summon One Who Is Willing to stand watch at the Northern Gate. Give me supremacy over Earth’s forces. Assist me in building physical, mental, and spiritual strength. Keep an eye on this circle so that I can have the courage to dive into the wonders of the cosmos! Great Northern Dragon, greet and welcome!

 ## How to Cast Dragon Spells

 As you see above, most dragon spells are going to be choosing the dragon associated with the spell, invoking the dragon, and then declaring your wish from the dragon.

 Frequently, you will also want to offer something in return for their help.

Here is an example of that for prosperity.

### Dragon Spell for Prosperity

To cast this dragon spell, you will need the following items:

 *   Green pillar candle
*   Dragon’s blood incense
*   A green silk pouch
*   Five different coins
*   An altar

The first step is to carve the figure of a dragon onto the candle. You could also use the symbol for prosperity:

 It is common to use a ballpoint pen or a little sculpting tool. The engraving does not have to be a complex piece of art; a basic outline would suffice.

 Begin on the new moon’s night. Place the dragon candle on your altar in front of the incense. Place the money on the candle’s left side and the silk pouch on its right.

Light the green candle and incense. Close your eyes and imagine the dragon in his lair as you pick up the coin and hold it securely.

 Look at his treasure and all the wealth he protects. Approach the dragon gently in your mind’s eye. Display your currency to the dragon. Then, with due reverence, request that the dragon increase your fortune as follows:

> A call to the prosperous One
> This invocation has begun
> I now greet you of Power
> And call upon you this hour

Spend some time with the dragon. Pay attention to what he says and follow his counsel. Leave the dragon’s cave as he begins to fade and return to the present. Fill the green silk purse with the coin and thank the dragon.

 Allow the candle to burn for one hour before extinguishing it. Repeat this spell each night until all of the coins are in the green pouch. Allow the flame to burn out entirely once the final coin has been placed in the bag.

 The rite is then finished.

## What to Do After You Cast Dragon Spells

Now that you know how to cast dragon spells, what should you do next?

Here are a few tips:

 1.  Make sure you stay positive and focused.
2.  Visualize the outcome you want to achieve.
3.  Believe in yourself and your ability to make things happen.
4.  Follow through with your actions once the spell is cast.

If you are not seeing the results within one month, you have a few options.

You can simply call upon the dragon again or call upon a different dragon. This is the simplest plan.

 The more complicated follow-up is to find out what went wrong by using a questioning invocation. This is important if you think you have somehow offended or upset the dragon. Once you fix what went wrong, you should be all set to use dragon magic again.

 ## Avoiding Common Mistakes When Casting Dragon Spells

When casting dragon spells, it is important to avoid making common mistakes. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1.  Make sure you are well-rested and focused before you begin.
2.  Clear your mind and focus on your goal.
3.  Use the right ingredients and tools for the spell.
4.  Be patient and stay positive.
5.  Follow through with your intentions.
6.  Timing

Nothing affects humans more than sleep. You should never be doing large, important spells of any type on insufficient sleep.

 Also, patience is key. Dragons don’t operate on the same time scale as humans. What feels like a long time for you will be nothing for the dragon. Sometimes you may wait for an hour after summoning to feel the approach.

Dragon spells are not for the impatient. They are absurdly powerful, and so that can take a lot of work and sacrifice to get them going.

The importance of research cannot be overstated here. You will want to look up the name of the dragon you are going to use and understand the mythology surrounding that dragon.

 You also want to have a good idea of the visual representations of the dragon so that you have a clear idea when you visualize for summoning.

The best time to cast dragon spells is during the waxing moon when the power of the moon is at its strongest. This is the time when you should be focusing on attracting positive things into your life.

## Conclusion

As a beginner, you may find that some of the more complex dragon spells are beyond your level of experience. However, there are still plenty of powerful spells that can help you achieve your goals.

 The spells listed in this article are some of the most effective and easiest to cast. So, if you’re looking to unleash the power of the dragon, be sure to try out one of these spells today.
