    involved, twine your fingers. If you are just friends, spread your hands like
    a high-five. If your intention is to START a relationship, keep your fingers together.
    Drape the ribbon over the hands, tying a knot if possible. Say these words as
    if you are talking to a beloved Friend:'

    can break it, not even the caster, nor death. You two will be bound forever. No
    power in this world or the next will change that fact. With that knowledge going
    forward, keep your decisions wise.
