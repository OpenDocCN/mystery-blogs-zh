# Bring love into your life

This simple and beginner-friendly spell utilizes the power of the number nine and the cycles of the moon to bring love into your life, and is done using things probably already lying around your house.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Bring love into your life'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   9 inches of yarn, thread, or another string-like cord (preferably pink/red)

*   piece of paper

*   something to write with

*   scissors

*   10th night before a full moon

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   9 inches of yarn, thread, or another string-like cord (preferably pink/red)

*   piece of paper

*   something to write with

*   scissors

*   10th night before a full moon

 Around midnight of the 10th night before a full moon, cut 9 inches of yarn, thread, or another string-like cord and tie 9 knots in it, while chanting:

"By knot of one, the spell's begun.
By knot of two, it cometh true.
By knot of three, so mote it be.
By knot of four, this power I store.
By knot of five, the spell's alive.
By knot of six, this spell I fix.
By knot of seven, events I'll leaven.
By knot of eight, it will be Fate.
By knot of nine, what's done is mine." And either visualizing the results or imagining the feeling of love.

    By now you should have 9 knots in your cord-like material, so set it aside. Next, you'll grab your piece of paper and write down "I will bring love into my life" or other similar affirmations 9 times while chanting the phrase as you write it. Roll up your paper like a scroll, and tie your cord-like material around it. In each of the consecutive nights, cut off/untie a knot and repeat an affirmation, one at a time.

    On the night of the full moon, you cut off/untie the last knot and repeat one last affirmation. Put both the paper and the cord-like material either under your pillow or in another safe place. The following morning, cut the paper into 9 pieces and bury the two materials in the ground outside, finalizing the effects of the spell. Results should manifest themselves over the following moon cycle/month, although it could happen much sooner or later.
