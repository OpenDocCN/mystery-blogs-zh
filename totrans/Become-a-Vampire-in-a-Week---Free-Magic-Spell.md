it says that i need a red candle that is optional but then it says i need it to be night

It doesn't matter when you do it or what you have to do it. This spell will not work.

Try to use the red candle sometimes its better to have the candle because.fire of the flame, air to feed it, melted wax for water, and solid wax for earth. Candles represent all elements. Also it does work you shouldn't listen to nonbelievers. I'll do it and I'll tell you how it goes. Also you needs lots of faith in this type of magic and remeber this kinda magick comes with a cost. So think twice before doing a spell like this.

You cannot physically become a vampire.
