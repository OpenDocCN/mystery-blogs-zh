**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Meditate so you can concentrate. Put the"water stone(s)"in the water. Put your hands in the water with a"water stone"(if you don't have more than one, clamp both of your hands around it)in each hand. Say this while thinking about waterbending/controlling water:

Water flow
Flow to me
I wish to control thee
Water flow
Flow to me
May I control thee?
Water flow
Flow to me
I shall control thee!
By the power of the full moon
I shall control thee!
By the power of the next full moon
I will control thee!

Flow to me
So mote it be."

Take your good hand(writing/throwing hand)out of the water and"draw"a petagram on the surface of the water with your fingers. Do the same with the other hand. Repeat step 5,this time with both hands(one on top of the other). Scoop up the"water stone(s)"(all of them)out of the water with both hands,and drop them back in.
