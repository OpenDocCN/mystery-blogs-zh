    could cast spells for some wishes provided they're things that magick can do.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a bit confusing to me that people view pointing out facts about magick
    as disrespectful. No one is trying to be disrespectful, they're trying to educate
    someone about magick. If someone said they were going to try and eat deadly nightshade
    and someone else told them not to because it's poisonous, no one would say that
    was disrespectful and insist you just had to believe. People are allowed to state
    facts about things, and it helps beginners learn when people comment that spells
    are fake.

    nature nor will you be granted the power to make any wish come true.
