    that I practice.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This spell came to me after long debate over a ''problem'' that I HAD with another
    witch. The inspiration came from one of my dark Lwa and ever since, I have not
    had the problem again.

- en: My cauldron is suspended (in a dark corner) under my working altar and above
    a dragon flame candle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of this cauldron is to be a place of agony, pain, misery, torture
    and destruction for whoever the witch decides.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the cauldron is ready, all that would be needed is a ''link'' to the subject
    to be placed in the cauldron.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A link could be hair, nail clippings, bodily fluid, photograph or piece of paper
    with as much of the subject's information as possibly.

- en: '**This spell requires the Witch to be able to manipulate energy, be a freethinker
    and be able to create. Following another witches spell is not good and it''s not
    recommended as your only mimicking another. A true witch will create, so use my
    spell as a guide but make it your own. Make it mean something to you.'

- en: '****This cauldron, once completed, if done right should make the witch cringe
    a bit and that is the point. I am not saying you should be afraid of this... but
    it should, at the very least, make you nervous opening the lid. Not because of
    its ingredients but because of the purpose and its power!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I use a medium to large sized cauldron for this spell as I never know how many
    subjects will be in at the same time. You are free to use whatever you have on
    hand. Not all ingredients will be available to everyone and that is ok, Magick
    is mainly about the intent and not so much about the ingredients. The more of
    these ingredients you can get the better and if you only have a few for now and
    can order or wait for others later, then work with what you have and add as you
    go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you construct this spell, it is REAL IMPORTANT that you are mad, upset,
    angry and hurt. Now, it is also REALLY IMPORTANT that you separate those feelings
    from whoever or whatever was the cause. When you do this spell, you want only
    the negativity to go into the cauldron and not the person who caused it for you.
    The reason is that you will want this cauldron to work with more than one subject
    (if not, then disregard).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each ingredient can be used for positive or negative, in this case, we want
    the negative for most ingredients. For some ingredients you want to use for force
    and/or power.As you place each item into the cauldron you want to transfer the
    energy into that item. You will want to have a cauldron full of anger, fear, poison,
    hatred and destruction. Once everything is all complete, you will want to consecrate
    the cauldron. Be creative and mean/feel what you say.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For me, I place a photo of the subject into the cauldron. The photo usually
    will have the name, date of birth and a sigil. *If you don't have a photo of the
    subject, be creative or message me for ideas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right before putting the subject into the cauldron, I find it helpful to think
    what they did that wronged me and decide how long I will keep them in the cauldron.
    I let the anger build up then I transfer the energy into the photo and place it
    into the cauldron and walk away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*I like to come up with the length of time they will stay in the cauldron before
    I get angry that way it doesn''t become a ridiculous amount of time. I don''t
    use this spell on the folk who back talks me or trash talks me, my family or loved
    ones as I have other methods of Magick for them. This is for someone who has truly
    caused torment, harm, hurt, and pain (Examples would be: someone who raped you
    or a loved one, someone who tortures you, someone who tries to ruin your name
    or attack you).'
