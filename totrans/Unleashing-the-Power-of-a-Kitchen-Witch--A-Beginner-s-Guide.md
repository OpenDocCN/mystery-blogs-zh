## What is Kitchen Witchcraft?

Many of the ingredients used in the practice are sourced from nature such as herbs, spices, and flowers and you most likely already have a lot of them in your pantry.

## Supplies and Ingredients for Kitchen Witchcraft

The supplies and ingredients you will need will depend on the type of spell you are creating and the desired outcome.

For supplies, you will need **containers**, such as **jars** or **bowls**, to store your ingredients in and to use for your rituals. You will also need **candles**, matches or a lighter, and a pen and paper for writing down your spells and rituals. For ingredients, you can use a variety of items depending on what type of spell you are creating and the desired outcome.

> Common ingredients used in Kitchen Witchcraft include herbs and spices, essential oils, crystals and stones, and flowers. You can also use items from nature such as feathers, leaves, and sticks.

When choosing your ingredients, it is important to remember that each item has its own energy and power and should be chosen with intention. For example, if you are creating a spell for love, you may choose to use rose petals or jasmine flowers.

#### Popular Spices and Herbs:

Cinnamon for attraction, Rosemary fro Protection, Thyme for Victory, Bay Leave for success, pepper for protection, salt for cleansing, lavender for love and peace, chilli flakes to drive away negative influences.

## Crafting Kitchen Witchcraft Charms

When creating Kitchen Witchcraft charms, it is important to remember that the power of the charm is in the intention behind it. **Charms are meant to be placed in your home or carried with you as a reminder of your intention and to bring positive energy into your life.**

When crafting your charms, you can use a variety of items such as crystals, stones, and herbs. It is important to choose your items with intention and to use items that represent the desired outcome.

Once you have gathered your supplies and ingredients, you can begin to craft your charm. Start by placing your items into a pouch or a jar and optionally adding a few drops of essential oil, if you have any. You can also add a few drops of magical oil to each individual item if desired and again if you have any. Once your items are in the container, close it and focus on your intention. *Visualize the desired outcome and speak your intention aloud. Once you have done this, your charm is ready to be used.*

#### Simple Kitchen Witch Pouch Talismans

*   **Good luck charm:** citrine, rosemary, bay leaves

*   **Love charm**: cinnamon, lavender and rose quartz

*   **Protection charm:** obsidian, thyme, chili flakes

#### Kitchen Witch Doll Charm

The **kitchen witch doll charm** has been a part of Northern European customs for centuries, believed to bring good luck and protection to the kitchen, counteracting any ill will directed to the home. It is considered good luck to give a kitchen witch to a friend or family member, and sometimes a note about its meaning is hung around the witch's neck.

**You can simply make one out of your own old clothing and stuff it with dried herbs like lavender or rosemary.**

## Crafting Kitchen Witchcraft Rituals

Rituals are an important part of Kitchen Witchcraft and can be used to bring your intentions to life. Rituals are powerful tools that can help to manifest your desired outcomes. They are also a great way to connect with nature and your own energy and to make your every day life more magical.

> Common items used in rituals include candles, crystals, and herbs, spices or even everyday tools from your home or kitchen.

You can use a variety of items such as crystals, stones, and herbs and arrange them around the candle to focus your intention further - **make a simple circle of herbs around the candle**. After meditating on your intention you can let the candle safely burn (check some fire safety rules first, for example never leave your candle unattended. Once the candle burns down the spell is completed. (yes you can burn it over multiple days)

> You already done kitchen witch candle ritual : blowing candles on a birthday cake to make a wish, definitely counts as a kitchen witch spell ritual.

## Working with Kitchen Witchcraft for Self-Care

Kitchen Witchcraft is a wonderful way to practice self-care and to bring positive energy and intention into your life. Self-care rituals are a great way to connect with your own energy and to create an environment of positivity. One of the great ways how to utilize kitchen ingredients are **relaxing spell baths** (if you do not have a bathtub, that is fine, you can do hand bath of foot bath instead)

#### Triple Herb Self Love Bath

1.  Make a fabric pouch with love and peace related herbs : **lavender,chamomile and rose.**

2.  Hold the pouch in your hand and focus your intention of self love and self care while holding it. Alternatively you can charge it overnight on your altar, if you have one.

3.  Put the pouch in a warm bath and visualize being surrounded by golden light as you bath.

4.  Once the bath is done, it is ok to simply throw the herbs away, or compost them if you have a compost.

> You can also create a **Magical Salve** - follow a regular salve creation from herbalism, pick ingredients of the right correspondences and once the salve is finished, you can let it charge on your altar under a full moon.

**Self- Love Salve Recipe** : Calendula, Lavender, Rose in almond oil infusion.

*To be a kitchen witch, you don't have to go very far, possibly no more than just a few steps. Witches always, since the beginning of days used whatever they had at hand and existed successfully without any exotic ingredients for millennia. Sometimes we just need to open our eye bit more to be able to see the extra-ordinary in the seemingly ordinary.*
