    boost your confidence, it is still up to you to work on building your confidence
    in specific areas. And the confidence spell will most likely bring you *opportunities*

    or arrogant. This is also not true. The spell is designed to help you feel more
    secure in yourself, not to inflate your ego. True confidence knows no bounds.

    It is important to remember that the spell is simply a tool to help you and that
    you should continue to work on building your confidence even after performing
    the spell. Don’t use this spell as a crutch to avoid any negative feelings because
    that will backfire, big time. Instead, use this as a tool in your arsenal.
