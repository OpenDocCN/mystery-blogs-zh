- en: Why use only a little bit of water every day?  **My answer to this is that the
    average person doesn't lose interest in something they like at the snap of someone's
    fingers. It's lost over time, just how spells don't work instantaneously. **
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How long will it take to complete the ritual?  **It depends on what your goal
    is. My advice would be to use less water everyday for longer periods of time if
    their interest is passionate. **
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What concentrated liquid should I use? **Allow yourself to get creative with
    this one. For perhaps love related instances, use vanilla extract or a sweet drink. A
    safe alternative for what you aren't sure about use lemon juice or hand soap. **
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why use a marker? Can I use something else? **My advice would to be to use something
    the water will slowly erase over time. The idea is by the time you used up your
    water, you shouldn't be able to make out what the paper says since the writing
    is smudged, representing what they like is nonexistent and wiped clean. **
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After I'm finished with the ritual, what do I do with it? **Hide it and keep
    it around until you get your desired results. Shake it so the water can seep more
    into the paper. **

- en: I waited and nothing has happened! What should I do? **There's a possibility
    you may have made a mistake. Consult another magickal practitioner or do some
    divination to see what interfered with your results.  **

- en: Can this spell be used on myself? **Yes! Fun fact, I actually used it on myself
    to rid myself of a problematic crush I had big feelings for. It disappeared around
    a week later. **
