    it does in fiction. An enchanted book isn't going to blast people away from it.
  prefs: []

- en: You cannot enchant an object to blast someone away if they touch it. Blessing
    items are done because you plan to use them in your craft. You could bless a pen
    with love energy and use it to write petitions, sigils and spells associated with
    love. This would give it extra Magik. You can enchant a book with an invisibility
    spell so people overlook it on bookshelves thus protecting your secrets. You cannot
    enchant a book to do anything not naturally possible.
