- en: Spirit animals are the epitome of their own species. Like a totem, they represent
    their species and are not specific animals who have lived before. The horse can
    help you to be more independent and confident in yourself, to love yourself, and
    to stay true to yourself.

    of you. If you don't have a candle, that's fine. It doesn't matter where you are,
    it's best to do this in a quiet area, like your room.

    relaxed. After you are calm, you can open your eyes or keep them closed. In your
    mind, imagine what the horse spirit animal might look like. Imagine it approaching
    you slowly, a light fog and shining stars surrounding it with a soft white or
    yellow glow around the spirit.

- en: I feel this outline is incomplete. Are you suppose to meditate after the chant?
    Give an offering? Bless a horse shaped charm to use to symbolize them in future
    rituals? If you simply walk away, what happens to the energy you have raised in
    the process of the ritual? You need to ground yourself and the energy in the room.
    I would also cast a circle since you are preforming a ritual, but that is a personal
    choice.
