**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   The demon you want to be your guardian demon

*   Belief in Satan, the spell, and occult power

 Get yourself into a deep trance.. 

Vibrate the name of the Demon 30 - 40 times. (Ex: Amon. A-A-A-A-M-M-M-M-O-O-O-O-N-N-N-N). After a while, you should feel his/her energy. Connect with the Demon as best you can.

Ask _____________ if he/she is your Guardian. You will probably not see or hear anything if you are not psychically open, but you should FEEL their response.. Interpreting energy like this might be difficult at first, and if you don’t understand the response, then tell them you don’t understand and ask for a stronger signal. If you receive a very warm, positive signal then you’ve probably found your Guardian. If not, go back over your list and try again.
