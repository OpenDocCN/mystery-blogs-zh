- en: This is accomplished in much the same manner as Macha's Fence. But for this
    the God Manannan Mac Lir is called upon to aid the magician. The main sources
    of power will be The Two Powers and the energies of Land, Sea and Sky. The Two
    Powers represent Earth and Sky, Underworld and Upperworld. Land, Sea and Sky represent
    the three elements found in Celtic thought. Any altar used should be in the center
    of the working area and represent the Bil, or the World Tree, which is the center
    of all things and touches all realms. As you open each gate, know that it will
    remain open and that its energies will be available during the entire ritual.

    in opening the gates to the realms of power. Keep us safe from harmful influences
    and let the energies summoned be balanced and potent. Manannan... Manannan...
    Manannan."'

    saying: "Let this gate be opened. This altar is the Bil, the sacred Worldtree,
    the center about which all else revolves. Let this gate be opened." See that the
    altar is actually the Bil, and feel its energy.'

    your magick. Alternatively, or additionally, you could have opened gates of the
    fire and well, as in ADF liturgy.
