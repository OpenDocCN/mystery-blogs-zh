- en: You can use knot magic together with a simple incantation to restore your health
    or that of someone else. The spell draws power from number 6, usually associated
    with the sun, and drawing its restorative and regenerative power. The same number
    is also linked with family love, nurturing and service to other people. It’s very
    appropriate to cast the spell on behalf of another person.

- en: Royal blue and indigo are the colors associated with number 6\. So you should
    use a cord of either of these hues to make the magic stronger. You need salt,
    a piece of cord about 8 inches long, paper, a tin, a fountain pen, cellotape or
    sealing wax. Mark the length 6 times, equally to make sure you have 7 equal intervals.

- en: Tie a knot at each mark by starting with the two middle ones, followed by those
    at both ends and finish with the ones in the middle. Each time you tie a knot,
    you should repeat the following words,

    and fill it up with salt. Seal up the tin and bury it under a favorite bush or
    tree.
