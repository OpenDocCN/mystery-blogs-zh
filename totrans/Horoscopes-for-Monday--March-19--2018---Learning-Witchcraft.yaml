- en: The time has come to admit that your destiny is in your own hands and that any
    problems you have are largely of your own making. If you can manage to do that
    over the coming 12 months you will find that solutions quickly reveal themselves.

- en: Try not to focus too rigidly on one specific task over the next 24 hours. This
    is one of those times when you will do better, and feel happier, if you do whatever
    takes your fancy and don’t worry too much about long-term goals and plans.

- en: Most likely you won’t be thinking too clearly today, so try not to attach too
    much importance to what your mind tells you. That applies in particular to money
    matters and business issues. Wait until later in the week before making decisions.

    ease. You don’t believe that? Well you should because it’s true. Your mind is
    your most powerful weapon, so use it well. Brain beats brawn every time.

    It could in fact turn out to be quite a good thing as the next few weeks will
    bring numerous situations that require thinking and planning, not talking and
    doing.

- en: Anyone who tries to give you advice today is sure to regret it. You are in no
    mood to be told what you should do, and in even less mood to be told that you
    are doing it all wrong. You know what’s what and don’t need others to correct
    you.

    fall out with someone in a position of authority today. By all means stick up
    for yourself but don’t make enemies of powerful people for no good reason.

- en: You don’t have to try so hard Leo. As the Sun moves closer to one of the better
    areas of your chart you can afford to relax a bit. But that does not mean you
    can take silly risks just to prove yourself. The world knows what you can do.

- en: Try not to fear the worst today, because it isn’t going to happen. Your anxieties
    could in fact work against you by making you too cautious about a matter that
    requires strong self-belief and a willingness to make quick decisions. Don’t lose
    your nerve.

    is: what are you going to do about it? First you must clear your head of angry
    thoughts. Then you must see the situation for what it is. And finally you must
    act!'

    to believe that everyone is out to deceive you. If someone offers to help you
    out on the work front today chances are it’s for real – there is no hidden agenda.

    yourself. Even if a friend you can usually trust tells you there is nothing to
    worry about you must still make inquiries – it will be well worth the effort.

    on that they are utterly wrong. On the home front, especially, you must give partners
    and loved ones the benefit of the doubt even if you suspect they don’t deserve
    it.
