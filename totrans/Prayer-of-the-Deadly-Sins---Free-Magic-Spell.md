 Say this as many times as you want whenever you want:

> **  "May demons of pride fill me with confidence, and let everyone see me as a sight to behold, May my voice and gait show my pride and glory to all who gaze upon me.
> May demons of greed bring treasures into my life, and keep my belongings safe from others. May others things I desire find their way into my hands with the help of demons.
> May demons of lust transform my image to have all lust for me. May I have control over my sexuality, and all who gaze upon me with the help of lust demons.
> May demons of envy make everyone envious of me, and overrun with the desire to lead my life. May I never envy others, for the demons have turned my life to dark.
> May demons of gluttony always bring me enough, may I be stuffed with food, and never starve. May what I eat taste great, and fill me up.
> May demons of wrath stay by my side, and cast my enemies into hell with my anger. May all who upset me pay the consequences.
> May demons of sloth allow my work to be done without doing work, and allow me to waste away as my job is completed."**
