- en: This spell is reputed to work very quickly, so do not be too rash. Red candles
    represent passion, so you must take responsibility for whatever happens when you
    call your lover to you.

    use it. Pins were often used in magical work in times gone by, because they were
    readily available. One old custom was to ask a bride for the pins from her wedding
    dress, for which you must give her a penny.
