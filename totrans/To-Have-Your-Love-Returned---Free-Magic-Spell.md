# To Have Your Love Returned

This spell is candle magic and also representational. It is a little more complicated than most because it requires an understanding of symbolism. It is best done on a Friday. The objects you use need not be the real things, but they can be miniaturizations such as cake decorations.

*   Key (to represent the key to your heart)

*   Two roses

*   An article of your love interests clothing

 Place the horseshoe and key on either side ofthe candles, with the roses between them. When the candles have burnt down, wrap the flowers, the key and the horseshoe in the clothing.

Place the items in a bedroom drawer and leave them alone for fourteen days. If after this time the flowers are still fresh, this is a good sign. You should then bury them or put them (along with the horseshoe and key) in a pot pourri.

You might use this spell when you think a relationship with someone would be worthwhile. If you cannot find an article of the other persons clothing, a handkerchief or some other small article will do as well. If that is not possible then use a square of pink material.
