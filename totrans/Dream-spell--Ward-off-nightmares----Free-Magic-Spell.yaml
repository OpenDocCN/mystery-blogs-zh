    Take the paper, draw the cloud, write a happy memory or desire such as ''I will
    not have nightmares.'' That part of the spell is fine. You should fold the paper
    towards you because you want this to come to you. Hold the paper and imagine positive
    dreams. You could burn the paper, but safely. Use tweezers so as not to burn yourself,
    and place it in a fireproof container. You can keep water nearby as well as a
    lid to be safe. Do this on a flat surface with nothing flammable nearby. I suggest
    doing so outside. Once the paper is burned, the fire will go out. It will just
    be scary for a moment when the whole thing goes up in flames. If you do not wish
    to risk fire, I would place the paper in a white bag with a few crystals and/or
    herbs, and place it under or on your bed. This will create a protection charm
    for your dreams. Some items you could use include lavender, chamomile, pink Himalayan
    salt, anise, dandelion root, bay leaf, peppermint, rosemary, amethyst, black tourmaline,
    lapis lazuli, clear quartz and rose quartz. Finally, the chant requires work.
    You should state your intention, and if you wish to call on a deity, you can,
    but it can be as simple as ''Good dreams come to me, as I will it, so shall it
    be.''
