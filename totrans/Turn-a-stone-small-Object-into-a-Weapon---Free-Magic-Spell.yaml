    the picture on the grass with the stone in the exact middle. Then say, ''oh Ares
    (or Mars, whichever you prefer), I ask of thee to turn this stone into a(n) (whatever
    weapon you chose) when I toss it in the air, and turn it back to normal whin I
    push the stone in. Amen.'' Now take the picture and stone inside and keep them
    with you at all times. Whenever in danger, toss the stone up and use it appropriately.
    When you're done, push the stone in to turn it back to normal.

    You can call on Ares for protection if you are defending yourself. He will not
    change a rock into a gun. Furthermore, ''amen'' is an Abrahamic prayer blessing,
    it means nothing to Hellenic deities or any witch who does not work with Yahweh.
    It is specific to the Abrahamic path. If you use it in your path, that is fine,
    but in terms of most Pagan paths, it is not.

    transformations of objects are not possible.
