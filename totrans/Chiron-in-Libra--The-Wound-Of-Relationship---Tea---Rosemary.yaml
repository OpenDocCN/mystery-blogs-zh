    from a past lifetime. Chiron in Libra is the particular *wound of relationships.*

- en: We tend to overcompensate in Chiron areas by becoming a bit extreme. It’s natural
    to try and “fix” the wound, but often I find that we *chase* a solution to fix
    our Chiron, instead of uncovering the solution inside of us.

    face, over and over, and can make your life pretty terrible, especially if you
    don’t know how to work with it. The Chiron in Libra wound is especially difficult
    because it’s all about relationships, something we deal with almost every day.

    life. Usually, this “something” is your soul mate.

    trying to fill it with things from the outside world. You might also feel as though
    the world is just a bit off-balance at all times.

    Whether you’re in a relationship or are alone, the wound is there. Chiron in Libra
    shows itself no matter how hard you try to hide it.

    These people typically feel inadequate socially as a child, regardless of whether
    or not this is apparent to others.

- en: This Chiron in Libra wound can show itself in a variety of ways. Often, these
    people feel alone and incomplete without a relationship, but they never find the
    fulfillment that they’re looking for *in* any relationship, either.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Chiron in Libra wound usually manifests as **conflict in interpersonal relationships**.
    It is *really* difficult for these folks to have relationships without triggering
    the wound. This can include conflicts in romantic relationships, as well as partnerships
    and friendships. If you have Chiron in Libra, be wary of self-neglect in relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most relationships for the Chiron in Libra person will be karmic. It is important
    for these folks to focus on relationships in order to heal the wound, but this
    spotlight must have the intention of learning and working on ways to approach
    relationships that are more authentic.

    It might be really hard for them to show their true self to their partner for
    fear of losing the relationship.
  prefs: []

- en: The terror of being alone makes it hard for a Chiron in Libra person to get
    out of a relationship, even if it becomes unhealthy. It’s not uncommon for these
    relationships to have some sort of abuse involved in them, mainly because the
    Chiron in Libra person is passive and malleable, so they’re really a prime target.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that those with Chiron in Libra tend to give far more than they receive.
    This is most likely due to their fear of being left alone. There are definitely
    “people-pleaser” tendencies with this placement; these are the classic conflict-avoidant
    individuals.
  prefs: []

- en: Alternatively, the Chiron in Libra individual can be so afraid of being alone
    that they refuse to engage in relationships at all. I don’t see this outcome as
    much, but it is certainly a possibility. These people are often able to give others
    relationship advice that they can’t follow themselves.

- en: Typically, the Chiron in Libra person gets into relationships with those who
    show a mirror image of the qualities they can’t see *in themselves*. They might
    also give to their partners what they aren’t able to give to their inner selves.

- en: A Chiron in Libra individual might live a double life. It’s easy for them to
    hide who they truly are inside if they feel that they must put on a face in order
    to stay in a relationship. Sometimes, these people will do this for years, even
    while living with a partner.

- en: This really is the classic Romeo & Juliet placement. Chiron in Libra is all
    about sacrificing yourself for the partner. Often, individuals do this because
    they are desperately trying to heal the wound, but it doesn’t fix it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that most Chiron in Libra placements are developed in a past life. Unlike
    other wounds, this wound is about karmic *relationships*, so Chiron in Libra people
    will usually meet the same souls over and over until the wound is healed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, these Chironic beliefs are cemented by parents or through other early
    life experience, but the original wound almost always comes from a relationship
    trauma in a past life.

- en: The first step to healing Chiron in Libra is to recognize that the true soul
    mate is within. The Chiron in Libra person is constantly looking to fill that
    “soul mate” void with other people, but they will only feel truly complete by
    connecting with the inner self.
  prefs: []

- en: You will find with this placement that others reflect your own needs back to
    you. If you see qualities in others that you feel you lack, then it’s time to
    try and discover those qualities *within yourself* instead of outsourcing.

- en: You will need to learn how to be authentic in a relationship, without hiding
    any part of yourself. You probably feel fear that you might be left alone if you
    do reveal your true self, but this is fear that you have to process and move through.
    It’s okay to be afraid. The lesson with Chiron in Libra is to do it anyways!

    develop. You will learn, by doing this work, that separateness and aloneness were
    simply illusions. I find that energy work can be especially helpful, as well as
    meditation and inner work.
