I don't think this simple chant could rid you completely off depression. If you are suffering with depression, I suggest getting professional help, rather than using a spell or chant.

Agree, a chant can help with sadness [say you're having one blue day] but it won't cure depression. It could also set your intention to help you find a therapist and treatment to help you.

It worked.. Thanks for your share...

Depression is a mental health issue. It needs therapy, sometimes medication. If this spell helps you manage your mental health, use it, but Magik cannot cure a chronic illness. Furthermore, since this spell equates sadness with depression, I would like to add, this may ''cure'' your sadness, but depression is more than feeling sad. It is apathy. It is a grey haze of numbness that makes you unwilling to do anything. A daily spiritual routine, like a good daily health routine, can help manage your mental health. But for some people, they need more than a quick meditation and a happy phrase to repeat in order to function.
