- en: New Moon rituals hold great significance in Wiccan practice, serving as a powerful
    time for spiritual growth and manifestation. The New Moon, which occurs when the
    moon is almost invisible in the night sky, symbolizes new beginnings, fresh starts,
    and the potential for transformation. During this phase, the moon’s energy is
    at its lowest point, making it an ideal time to release negative energies and
    set intentions for the upcoming lunar cycle. As Wiccans believe in the interconnection
    of nature and spirituality, the New Moon rituals provide a sacred space to align
    with the natural rhythms of the universe and harness its energy for personal and
    spiritual development.
