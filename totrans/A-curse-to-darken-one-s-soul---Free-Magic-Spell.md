# A curse to darken one's soul

This spell will sign your soul among the list of demons. I don't recommend it's use, but some may find it useful.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'A curse to darken one's soul'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   black roses

*   black candles

*   one white candle

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   black roses

*   black candles

*   one white candle

 Arrange the black candles in a circle, with the white one in the center. Light the black ones with the white one, and blow out the white one. Meditate on darkness in the middle of the circle. When you are done, blend the rose petals in a blender. Use the paste to form little balls, and create beads. Let them dry. Whenever you need to corrupt your soul for a little bit, deeply inhale the scent of one of the beads. Get rid of the bead, it has been used.

doesnt work. other then smelling good lol

If you wait a while (so I can post spells) then I will make one that works.

That would be fascinating.. You did it?

This does not work. You cannot sign your soul to demons. You can work with demons and dedicate yourself to a demon, but your soul will not turn dark and be demonic.
