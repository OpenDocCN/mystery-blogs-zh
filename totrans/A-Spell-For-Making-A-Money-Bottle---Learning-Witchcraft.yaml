- en: The roots of this spell are in voodoo and it called for Spanish silver or gold
    coins originally. It has been adapted to use in the 21st century, but still retains
    the power for drawing money to its spell weaver. The ingredients are for five
    of different things, with each having its own significance. The sign of the spell
    is Gemini, so if the spell is cast whenever this sign rules, it will be even more
    powerful. The spell is associated with communication, youth, quick thinking, change,
    risk-taking and freedom.

    with turquoise, the spell will be even more powerful if you can use a bottle that
    color.) Make sure that the top of the bottle is secure before you shake the bottle
    well for five minutes, while saying these words:'

    the loose change that you take from your pockets. Or if you don’t want anyone
    to know about your magic, you can bury your money bottle close to your house.
