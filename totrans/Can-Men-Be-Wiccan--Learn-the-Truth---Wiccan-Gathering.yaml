- en: Before Wicca was officially a religion, anyone observing Wiccan types of beliefs,
    practicing magic, or holding otherworldly ceremonies was labeled a witch. This
    was more often than not women, due to the historical associations of women with

- en: Since old times, women were the ones punished for practicing any form of magic.
    It didn’t matter if it was nature magic, kitchen magic, or any other tame and
    harmless form of magic. As long as it was some sort of thing that gave women power,
    it needed to be feared and punished.

  zh: 自古以来，女性因为练习任何形式的魔法而受到惩罚。不管是自然魔法、厨房魔法还是任何其他温和无害的形式，只要给予女性力量的东西，就需要被害怕和惩罚。
- en: Men usually got away with such things. They weren’t watched as closely or judged
    as harshly. Their words were often taken with trust and rarely doubted. This means
    that even if men did practice any form of magic back then, they would go unnoticed
    and unpunished.

  zh: 男性通常可以逃脱这些事情的追查。他们没有受到那么严密的监视或严厉的判断。人们经常相信他们的话，很少怀疑。这意味着即使男性当时确实练习了任何形式的魔法，他们也不会引起注意，也不会受到惩罚。
- en: This habit stuck throughout the years. Men weren’t as feared for practicing
    magic, so they were less often persecuted. In fact, there are very few records
    of men practicing magic that were ever written. You’ll see plenty of women recorded
    as witches and magic practitioners, especially women that were burned for it,
    but not many men.

  zh: 这种习惯一直延续至今。男性练习魔法并不像女性那样令人畏惧，因此他们很少受到迫害。事实上，关于男性练习魔法的记录非常少。你会看到许多女性被记录为巫师和魔法实践者，特别是那些因此而被焚烧的女性，但男性的记录却很少。
- en: We know that Wicca and witchcraft are two separate concepts. However in the
    general public, the two are often confused to be the same thing. Since women are
    widely known and recognized to have practiced such crafts in the past, they are

    they’re mostly the ones that proudly state their new-age religion in our modern

    Usually, you’ll only see women practicing witchcraft openly and accepting Wicca
    as their religion. However, it is very much possible for men to be Wiccan. The
    reason is that this religion does not discriminate between genders, and anyone
    who feels drawn to Wicca can practice it.
