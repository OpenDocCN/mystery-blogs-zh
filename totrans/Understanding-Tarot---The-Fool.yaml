- en: The Major Arcana is also known as the Journey of the Fool. This journey is one
    from innocence to enlightenment and symbolized by the emergence of consciousness.
    The fool marks the beginning of this journey and so to speak the ‘first step’
    in this magical journey.

- en: The fool viewed within the context of the Tarot is actually not a derogatory
    term – in fact – consider yourself the fool as you begin your study of the cards.
    To embody the Fool means embracing a childlike innocence, a wide-eyed wonder,
    and a state of openness to the world and its learnings. The Fool represents potential
    and primal energy, she also represents a clean slate ready to be molded through
    a path of self-discovery and knowledge. The fool opens her heart to adventure
    without fear and trepidation. She packs what little belongings she has and makes
    her way out into the world, ready for new beginnings and adventure. The path she
    travels is full of risks but can also bring great rewards.

    on a new way of life. This could be an outer way of life or something that only
    happens within. You’re certainly open to new experiences and ready to discover
    what lies around the bend. You might feel unsure about a path you’ve chosen but
    take your inspiration from the Fool and trust that everything will turn out well.
    The fool throws his heart out to adventure without fear and so should you.

- en: In reverse, the fool’s childlike naivety and disregard for consequences might
    signal a misstep or blindness to how her actions are affecting others. Whilst
    the upright fool symbolizes fearlessness and adventure, the reversed fool indicates
    hesitancy and doubt. Take this card as an invitation to examine how your actions
    might be affecting others and to pause and reflect.

- en: Lovelies, I hope this gives you some basic understanding of the Fool. As with
    all things Tarot, your own interpretation of a card or reading can be highly personalized
    and wonderfully multifaceted. With this perspective in mind, it pays to understand
    any outside interpretations (like this one) as simply one perspective which you
    can adapt and change as you see fit.
