    own version of any spell you come across. That is the best way to ensure success
    in magick.

- en: If the loved one knows you are doing it, one of the best spells you can use
    is to create a protection charm. They will be able to keep it with them for protection
    instead of just sending energy out into nature.
  prefs: []

    the results will be.

    but any sacred space will work. This can be an altar or just a place in your home
    that you’ve set aside for this moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This preparation is particularly important for a protection spell, as you don’t
    want existing negative energy to find its way into the charm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A classic way to do this is to use a sage smudge stick. Visualize the negative
    energy leaving or say a simple prayer as you move the stick through the area.
    Cleansing can be done any way you’ve learned in the past.

- en: I’ve put Angelica on the ingredients list because this is a cleansing herb that
    also has strong protective properties. You can use incense if you have it (or
    you could make the incense from fresh angelica).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I prefer to lay fresh Angelica in a circle. This will be the sacred area for
    the spell.

    carry a protection charm with them. In any event, there are many reasons to prefer
    an honest spell over a charm.

    special or pre-cleansed. I like to use the most natural salt I can find. This
