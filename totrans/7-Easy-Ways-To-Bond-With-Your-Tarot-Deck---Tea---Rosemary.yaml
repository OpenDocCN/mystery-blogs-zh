    to it. Sometimes you may need time to actually bond with a new deck, even if you’re
    super excited to begin.

    it isn’t a living entity, *anything* can be infused with energy and take on energy
    of its own.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing you should do when you get a new tarot deck is to clear or cleanse
    it your deck. [Check out this post](https://teaandrosemary.com/7-ways-to-cleanse-and-clear-a-tarot-deck/)
    to learn about different ways that you can quickly clear your new deck.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of bonding or connecting with your Tarot deck is to get to know
    it and infuse the deck with your energy, but you can’t do this if it’s not cleared
    of previous energy. This is why the first step should *always *be to clear your
    deck or you may get inaccurate readings and/or feel disconnected from the cards.

- en: 6\. Spend Time Learning Each Card
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I first get a new Tarot deck, I take a few hours and go through the deck
    card by card. The purpose of this exercise is to learn each card individually
    and to get a feel for the characters on the card.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look at the differences and similarities between each card and see how they
    fit together. If you’re familiar with other Tarot decks, then you can also compare
    these characters and drawings to your other decks. Try to notice what is different
    and unique about *this* deck.

    by learning its energy!

- en: 5\. Meditate On The Deck
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another spiritual way to bond with your Tarot deck is to meditate. I like to
    hold my deck in my hands while I follow a short guided meditation (there are plenty
    of short guided meditations on YouTube) or even just meditate on my own for 10
    minutes or so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of this meditation is to connect with the energy of the cards by
    raising your vibration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you can choose one card and meditate on the meaning of it. Try
    to connect with the energy of the card in your meditation and see what comes up.
    This is a good exercise if you want to bond even further with a deck you already
    use regularly, or if you want to learn more about a specific card that you struggle
    to understand.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to raise your vibration while bonding with your deck is to sleep
    with your new Tarot deck under your pillow. It sounds weird, but I promise – it
    works!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sleeping with *anything* under your pillow will impact your sleep and your dreams,
    so don’t be alarmed if your dreams are more cryptic or related to your deck somehow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if you don’t notice a change in your dreams, you are subconsciously and
    energetically bonding with your Tarot deck by sleeping with it because sleep is
    when your subconscious is active and your mind is the most vulnerable.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you work with the pendulum at all then you can consider infusing your Tarot
    deck with energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I swing my pendulum in a counterclockwise circular motion to clear my Tarot
    deck, then when it stops swinging, I reverse the direction and swing the pendulum
    in a circular motion clockwise, stating my intentions to infuse the deck with
    my energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can put your own energy straight into the deck or you can infuse it with
    love, trust, truth, or really any quality that you want from the deck. I like
    to do this every few months to make sure that the deck understands my intentions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good way to bond with a new Tarot deck or get reacquainted with an old deck
    is to sort or reorder all of the cards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can put the cards in any order that you want, such as major to minor by
    number (or reversed), or such as placing them in piles based on suit, number,
    meaning, imagery, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a great way to bond with each card *as well as* your Tarot deck if you
    want to get right down to business. It helps you to learn each card and its place
    in the deck without taking up too many hours.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At some point, the only way to bond further with your Tarot deck is to start
    using it. Give yourself simple, 1-3 card readings answering daily questions. Do
    a bunch of these small readings and you’ll connect with your deck in no time!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each deck will speak to you slightly differently because every Tarot deck has
    unique imagery and slightly different meanings. While I always recommend spending
    some time learning a deck and bonding with it before you jump into readings, once
    you’ve done 1-2 of the exercises above, it’s time to try out readings.
