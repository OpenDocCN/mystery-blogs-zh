    orders", e.g: "Husky-dragon hybrid with rainbow angel wings and a unicorn horn"'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, drawing a dragon is fine. Color the picture if you want,
    but know that your dream pets color isn't really up to you, it's up to nature.
    Fold the paper so you can't see the drawing and write your pets basic information
    such as height, weight, species, breed, personality, and gender. Fold the paper
    again so you can't see what you just wrote.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, write the dream pets special abilities. Shy away from such things as a
    giraffe with ice breath, but a cat that won't make you allergic is okay. Flip
    to the side of the folded paper you haven't written on, and write the following
    while saying it out loud, "This is my dream, to have this pet, so use the magic
    of fairies and nature to create this tame, loving animal for me, this is my dream,
    so create my dream pet for me, so mote it be."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, fill up the container with water and add in something that represents
    your animal, like a match for a dragon, milk for a kitten, or bamboo sprouts for
    a panda. Lastly, put the piece of paper spell side up in the water and watch it
    begin to dissolve. Once it is so dissolved you can't make out the words on the
    paper, say the spell again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After that, put the potion somewhere you think your dream pet would like to
    play. Leave it there until the paper is so dissolved you can barely see it. Then
    pour the liquid into a flowerbed or garden. From one hour to a few months later
    you will find your dream et in the same garden you poured the potion into. If
    your pet hatches out of an egg, check the place you let the paper dissolve in
    too.

    it'll not work when u wish for mythical creatures.

- en: do you think it might work for a panda? my sister really wants one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wish [I would have gotten one of every animal by now if it did] Magick doesn't
    create something out of nothing, so that panda has to come from somewhere. [You
    also need to consider the logistics of owning a panda] If this works, it would
    probably be one of the World Wildlife Foundation ''adopt an animal'' things where
    you pay to protect an animal in the wild and receive a certificate and a stuffed
    animal of said animal. Magickally, that's the more likely way it will work. If
    you're hoping to cast this and a panda suddenly appears the next day on your doorstep,
    there's 99% chance it won't, and a 100% likelihood you'll be returning the panda.
    Magick usually goes with the easiest, natural, and logical methods. If you wish
    for a thousand dollars, you'll more likely get extra hours at work than winning
    the lottery. Cast it to see how it goes, but realistically, you can't get a real-life
    panda with a spell.

- en: You said it was ok 2 do a dragon even saying to do a match, then you crush people's
    dream pet by saying mythical creatures are not allowed!?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's because the person who wrote this was incorrect about that and so people
    in the comments corrected them. If it was possible to create physical dragons
    with magick you'd see more dragons around.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Horsenettle is correct. Dragon's are astral creatures, not physical ones. Also,
    you can't create a real Dragon because there's more to creating life than belief.
    What you can do is either work with Dragons as equals [they won't be your pet]
    or you pool your energy into a thoughtform or servitor. As long as you give it
    energy and/or provide it with a task, it will exist. Once the energy/task is gone,
    it will turn back into energy and vanish.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you ask for a mythical creature, you won't be able to physically perceive
    it. And if you ask for a dragon, there is a chance you won't get one. Not necessarily
    because the spell didn't work. It could be because the dragons don't want/need
    a human as of that time.
  prefs: []

- en: This walks a very fine line. First off, if you do not work with fairys, do not
    call on them. Even if you do work with The Fae, I would not bother them with this.
    This could work as a manifestation, but as the writer suggested, be realistic.
    This would include exotic animals. You should also imagine how you would interact
    with the animal. Include difficult times like obedience training because this
    animal you are manifesting will be your companion for their entire life, so you
    should prepare yourself for everything that might come.
