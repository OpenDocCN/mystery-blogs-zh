# Chiron In Leo: The Wound Of Talent | Tea & Rosemary

Chiron is the Wounded Healer and is the asteroid that shows our deepest wounds. Chiron wasn’t originally important in astrology and is a “newer” asteroid, but I find it to have huge effects on almost every person’s chart I look at.

If you want to find out more about that subconscious emotional wound that you carry around, look to Chiron.

Today I’ll be going over Chiron in Leo, which is the placement I find most often in the charts of celebrities.

## The Chiron In Leo Wound

Someone with Chiron in Leo will feel that they are not recognized or noticed for their specialness. They might feel like they fade into the background.

In some cases this person may actually feel disliked, but they can also just feel ignored or unnoticed.  They will feel that they are not talented enough, not noticed for their talent, or generally unremarkable.

What’s funny is that people with Chiron in Leo are often pretty talented in some way. They can have issues related to how they *feel* about their talent as well as ego issues surrounding other people’s adoration of them.

This is usually because although people with Chiron in Leo try to show their talent to *others*, *they* aren’t actually convinced deep down that they have any talent at all.

At its core, Chiron in Leo creates a fear of joining in without a talent or reason; in reality, the person can join in groups or life just for the sake of existing. They are special just for being themselves, but feel worthless and do not realize this.

## How This Wound Will Show Itself

The Chiron in Leo wound will manifest in one of two ways.

**In one case**, the person with Chiron in Leo may try their hardest to be recognized, respected, or loved. They may try to get appreciation or attention and often attempt to be “famous” in some manner. They will do this to try and prove to themselves that they have no reason to feel unworthy, but that does not change the core feelings that they still have deep down.

**In the second case,** the person feels so unworthy of being the center of attention that they avoid the spotlight by any means possible. They will support *others* in this role (often children) by trying to help others gain notoriety and become successful in the spotlight.

In both cases, the person will be unusually sensitive to criticism. This insecurity can cause them to read into a situation and feel that they’ve been criticized when it isn’t true. They have a strong fear of rejection stemming from their own feelings of worthlessness.

Both types of Chiron in Leo people will also feel that they need to prove their worth through their talents or the talents of others; in either case they are always working towards proving themselves to the world. They don’t understand that they have nothing to prove.

Look at the house and aspects to see exactly *how* the person will feel a need to prove themselves. For example, if Chiron is in the 10th house, the person will try to prove themselves through career or public image, while Chiron in the 2nd house may mean the person attempts to feel worthy through money and possessions.

## Where Does the Wound Come From?

This wound, more-so than others, usually has roots in childhood.

I typically find that a person with Chiron in Leo was stunted (in some way) from expressing themselves creatively. This person probably did not get sufficient recognition from their parents during early childhood for their ideas or talents and this left them feeling worthless.

The child may have felt unimportant, unseen, or dismissed. They just weren’t *noticed*, or at worst they were noticed in a bad way (such as their parents remarking on their lack of talent).

## How to Heal Chiron in Leo

A person with Chiron in Leo needs to learn how to heal the inner child and accept *themselves.* It is the lack of self-acceptance and self-praise that causes the wound, although the person probably thinks it is the lack of acceptance from others.

The key is to recognize that this person has it within their power to realize how special they are and to find their gift to the Universe. With this placement, they have a really important place in the world and a unique gift to offer, but it is up to them to work through trauma and find it.

Inner child work may be extremely helpful if the individual finds that these issues do stem from childhood.

## Famous People With Chiron in Leo:

It’s also surprising to me that Chiron in Leo shows up in so many celebrities’ birth charts. Mostly, Chiron in Leo is in the charts of people who aren’t just famous but who are trendsetters or global sensations.

The whole issue behind Chiron in Leo is *not* being seen or feeling unnoticed, but I can only assume that this is the driver for these folks to work towards fame. Alternatively, they might be child stars (or born into a famous family) but feel that they aren’t seen for their true self.
