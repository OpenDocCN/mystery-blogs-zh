If you are going to be an earth dragon put the leaf,dirt,plant in front of you. If you are gonna be an electric dragon hold the electric device. Put the Picture behind you. and chant this 3x:
''Dragons of sky high, how I wish to be you! I wish to soar Just like you! I want my eyes to be (Color of eyes) and I want my dragon form to be (Color of dragon) I will be a dragon in (Days times 5) Please make my wish come true so mote it be!''

If you wanna shift at anytime that is... side affects are listed on the ingredients...Oh and you will have an EXTREME body pain for 3 days.

you cannot physically transform into a Dragon. you could try a guided meditation, or astral projection, but you will not become a Dragon.

Yeah but it would be nice if this kinda thing worked. IF YOU COULD CHANGE BACK.

Careful using caps, excess use is against site rules. I will agree it would be neat to transform into a Dragon or other creature, but the reality is we can't.
