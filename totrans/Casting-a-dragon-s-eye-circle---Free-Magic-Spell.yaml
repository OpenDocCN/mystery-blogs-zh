- en: The spell has several uses much like any traditional circle you would draw,
    and can include; protection, healing, cleansing of a sacred space, and of course
    as preparation for working a spell or rite/ritual. As such the circle will follow
    the intent you hold while making it so feel free to incorporate the process into
    other magics you wish to perform. Typically I draw this circle as a stand-alone
    when I want to create a small place of power by tapping into elemental energy
    and the earth's ley-lines/dragon-lines. The shape of the dragon's eye sigil is
    a natural draw of energy to a single point and the circle acts to hold that energy
    and lets it collect within the circle. To make a temporary or one-time use circle,
    simply draw it wherever is most convenient for what you intend to do. As long
    as it is a place where you are not likely to be disturbed for the duration of
    what you intend to do with it. Ideally in a natural setting where you can make
    the circle a part of the ground such as in earth among trees, in sand at a beach,
    or in chalk on the stone of a cave or cliff/rock. For a more permanent circle,
    you can draw it into a circle of cloth or heavy fabric to carry with you and place
    where needed, or of course you can incorporate the circle into your altar room.
    ---------------- Drawing the circle; 1) Draw your circle using your personal height
    as the measurement of radius. This is the representation of your connection to
    and ownership of the circle. Any medium works, so pick based on where the circle
    is. A branch or knife for earthen places, chalk, wax, etc for a harder surface
    or one you don't want damaged/carved. *tip* place a tent stake or weight into/onto
    the ground and tie a string to it that is measured to your height. Then just go
    around the circle with it stretched out to draw a smooth one every time. 2) imagine
    a clock face on the circle, with 12:00 being at north. estimate as close as you
    can three points on the circle, and mark them just inside the boundary. One at
    about the 2:00 hour, one at 6:00 hour, and one at 10:00\. now connect the 10:00
    to the 2:00, 2:00 to the 6:00 and of course the 6:00 to the 10:00 with straight
    lines, forming a triangle. 3) find a point as close to the middle of the triangle
    as you can. if there is a mark from the tent peg you used earlier, use that. Draw
    straight lines connecting each corner of the triangle to that central point. It
    should now look like a triangle made up of triangles, or like a pyramid if you
    were looking straight down at it from above. If you want to deepen the protective
    nature of the circle, you can also lay twelve stones in sun-wise (clockwise) order
    to represent the light of the twelve star houses, placing each stone with a spoken
    personal affirmation of protection. My Go-to statement is "I place this stone
    as I build this wall. The light of the twelve star-houses protects me." 4) When
    the drawing of the circle is completed (and the stones are laid), return to the
    east side of the circle. reach down and smooth out/un-mark an area of the circle
    that is only wide enough for you to step through. If you placed stones, lift the
    one from the 3:00 position and place it in your pocket. This will be the key to
    your 'door'. 5) Extras; if you have some fine iron or silver filings, you can
    sprinkle them about within the circle to act as a symbolic conductor of the energies
    you wish to draw up from below. You can also light incense, or use a singing bowl
    or chimes to represent the energy you wish to draw from above. Also, if this circle
    is being drawn as a part of a larger spell or ritual, this is when you would bring
    within any tools and offerings you plan to use to call your corners and otherwise
    do your working. ------------------- Closing/empowering the circle; 1) When it
    is time to use the circle and you have done all other preparations for your chosen
    intent, step to the 'door' to your circle and center yourself. A simple breathing
    exercise suffices. If you have a statement or affirmation you typically use to
    mark the beginning your magic rituals, you can do that now. If you laid stones,
    make sure you have the one you took with you when the circle was drawn. If you
    have a personal symbol of will that is not being included with the rest of your
    ritual like an athame, spear, sword, staff, or even just a sturdy stick, have
    that with you as well. 2) Step into the circle with confidence and full intent
    to use it for the task that it was built. Turn and draw closed the line of the
    circle so that it is once again complete. If you used stones, place the stone.
    With the theme of laying them before, I state "The stone is Laid, the wall is
    built, the lock is sealed." as I set it down. 3) Stand at the center of the circle,
    over the focal point of the dragon's eye sigil. Raise your arms to shoulder height,
    palms upwards or outwards, your symbol of will (if you are using one) in your
    dominant hand. Breathe in, visualize yourself in a place of strength, authority,
    and focused will. Breathe that energy out into your circle. 4)As you breathe in
    again draw your hands together in front of you at chest height, elbows comfortably
    bent, repeating your visualization. When your hands come together, breathe out
    again and release the second wave of energy to empower the first. 5)Finally keep
    your hands together and raise them up slightly, to the height of your brow while
    breathing in. While breathing in, repeat the visualization of building energy
    within for a third time. 4) Once the breath in is completed, without hesitation
    blow it out firmly in a huff and thrust your hands downward. If you have a symbol
    of will, press it into the ground at the top of the circle between the border
    and the sigil. Imagine the built energy following the gesture to fill the ground/floor
    of your circle and empower the drawn lines within, connecting them into a single
    continuous, unbroken line of light that glows upward and downward. Imagine that
    energy connecting to the flowing energy of the earthen dragon-lines and the nebulous
    strands of the aurora in the sky. You may now use the circle. This is where I
    usually sit at the center and meditate to raise my vibration to the highest state
    I can reach, letting the energies all collect and feed each-other to resonate
    within the circle. After a short time I imagine myself a bridge, allowing the
    healing and supportive energy of the earth to flow up my body from the soles of
    my feet through to upwards from the top of my head, and simultaneously imagine
    the highest vibration I can reach of spirit energy running through me from the
    top of my head through downwards to flowing out of my feet into the ground. Basically
    I allow myself to become a pipe to let earth and spirit energy connect into and
    feed/balance and heal each-other. For me it is a very powerful experience and
    can make a sacred space absolutely humm. Done even semi-regularly it can change
    the atmosphere of the whole place for an enduring time. -------------------- Opening/releasing
    the circle; When you are finished with your task, and any summoned spirits/guides/guardians/etc
    are dismissed and the magic working is fully concluded, simply touch your palm
    to the place you earlier thrust your hand (or take a hold of your symbol of will)
    and lift it gently from the spot. While lifting, mentally let go of the pent up
    energy and imagine it flowing away and fading like a morning mist. If you are
    keeping the circle in place for future use or to continue the working the next
    day/night, simply smooth out the eastern side of your circle and/or lift the stone
    at the 3:00 position and step out. Otherwise if you are finished with the space,
    clean up the site as you would any other circle by rubbing or washing out the
    circle and sigil and continue on your way.

    of this Dragons eye circle [red Dragon for 12, yellow Dragon for 3 so on] overall
    it sounds alright.

    Heh... That's what makes magic so interesting. It is a constant exercise of learning,
    changing, adding, and tweaking. In all honesty I don't think I have ever worked
    the same spell the same way twice. As I grow and learn new things they are always
    affecting what I do.

    a personal sacred space, which you can then use towards a specific goal or intent.
    Circle casting is normally one component of a larger formal or ritualised working.
