- en: There are many languages of love. We believe that cooking is one of them. Food
    expresses our passions, thoughts, feelings without any words whatsoever. Cooking
    also lets us show our friends, family, dates, partners and children that we care
    by fine tuning recipes until they fit personal tastes. There’s something wonderful
    about a home cooked meal any day, let alone on special occasions. What if you
    could make your pantry into a Kitchen Witch – type place house where you sprinkle
    in a little Zodiac zeal?

    Then we use that information as a building block for any snack or meal. Obviously
    *asking* people what they may like helps, but using a little celestial know-how
    can help too!

    Everyone has unique tastes. What we find in the Zodiac is that some Sun Signs
    are refined eaters (and often fantastic chefs). Others have a more laissez-faire
    outlook because they’re simply not that picky. Whether you dine out, order in
    or make it yourself, you want good results. Many people already check their horoscope
    for all manner of advice, so why not food?

    That doesn’t mean they don’t love flavor, rather they simply want to be able to
    enjoy it on the go! Don’t worry about silk napkins and candles, just hand them
    a good paper towel, well made finger food, and a tall dark beer. The more fun
    the food is, and often the spicier, the faster it goes straight to the Ram’s heart.
  prefs: []

    is hot sauce, they’re probably an Aries. Hot sauce is suitable for everything!
    Other rich herbs dot the pantry shelves too – think Indian and Tai, both of which
    can pack a real WOW factor. For beverages, spicy vegetable juice in the morning,
    followed by a drive-through espresso get the morning off to a perfect high-power
    start (red tie not required).

    charismatic and curious. They love to play games, so keep your cooking whimsical!
    Food that speaks to all the senses somehow – if it sizzles, smells great, looks
    beautiful on the plate, can be fed to each other, and of course tantalizes the
    tongue… well, that’s one sure way to go right to the Ram’s heart.

    meat and potato folk. Pull out good hamburgers or steak and watch a smile appear.
    That type of food disappears nearly as quickly as you place it on the table. The
    only time Aries is quiet at dinner is when they’re chowing down, and quickly at
    that. If you’re looking for Ms. Or Mr. Manners – don’t invite a Ram for chow.
    They get hungry regularly, and want food ready in that moment.

    applies fully here. If you are entertaining a Taurus do not skimp on sale items

    prefers a laid back surrounding where he can eat slowly, savoring every bite.
    Picnics suit Taurus’ earthy nature perfectly. If weather doesn’t allow how about
    creating an indoor picnic or Oriental low-table style fare? Just remember the
    pillows!

    recipes. Their patience makes them good bakers (and since they like sweets – that’s
    a bonus). Don’t be fooled by what seems simple – these dishes will be wonderful.
    The Taurus cook spends a lot of time paying attention to details. The end product
    will look like a masterpiece on the plate.

    a snack. Tea and cookies do not begin to satisfy a Taurus’ tastes or appetites.

    (with a squeeze of orange), surf & turf and pear-chocolate tart or lush ice cream.

    at front and center. Overall having snack foods sprinkled around the house makes
    Gemini happy. They like to nibble their way through the day. This satisfies their
    need for variety.
  prefs: []

    easy meals with the ingredients you know they like. They’ll still get a decent
    helping of something before running off and doing that social “thing” Geminis
    do so well. Don’t feel offended by the eat-and-run. The fact that they stopped
    to eat is a complement by itself.

    means making a tasting table that has place cards with a bit of history behind
    the dish keeps your Gemini enthralled. Encourage her to share edible memories
    and ideas too. This sign loves teaching, it doesn’t matter the subject. The small
    portions of a tasting table also make it easier to keep a conversation going without
    food in your mouth.

    not good at standard fare, tho. If you ask a Gemini how something was made, they’ll
    give you a rough synopses but can rarely duplicate the results. They often don’t
    think about the recipe – they dance with it. Gemini cooks also like to make small
    portions as much as they like eating them.

    give all their attention to the food, there is a subconscious positive reaction

    with plate in hand. If you make soup, have clever cups available.

    love the crunch). Follow that with a lightly dressed cucumber, cherry tomato salad
    (perhaps with a hint of feta). Your main dish can be strawberry-lavender chicken
    bites. Dessert? Old fashioned pecan pie with whipped cream.

    – that’s exactly what Cancer loves. This kind of menu speaks to the Crab’s passion

    yogurt and eggs.

    and distractions is food. This alters their demeanor fairly quickly especially
    if you make one item that’s just for them (no sharing). If you’re taking that
    treat to the office, make sure you have the necessary utensils or create happy
    finger food like watercress finger sandwiches on fresh rye.

    framework for their meals and probably post it on the refrigerator door. Some

    sample menu begins with baby shrimp tossed in lemon and basil and a fresh spinach-cranberry
    salad. Move to a main course of savory crepes, followed by a luscious banana split
    for dessert. For after-dinner conversation? White wine.

    acts as a side dish to a really moist burger with all the fixings. End your meal
