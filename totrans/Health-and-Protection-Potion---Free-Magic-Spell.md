 Mix together almond water and basil water into small bowl. Put apple slice and cut bay berry fruit into mixture and leave in cool place for 10 minutes. Take out apple slice and bay berry and let water drip off into bowl.

Sprinkle in arrow dust (too much arrowroot dust will cause the potion to turn it a paste) and stir until either clear or well mixed. Put into vial and keep in dark cool place until used, when used a small amount will be enough to heal headaches and pain in muscles and bones. If it turned out as paste rub on pained area for same result.

Is almond water almond milk? And is basil water basil tea?

In theory, I would agree with you. Basil water would be a bowl of water you placed basil in to absorb its energy, so I would assume almonds would be the same thing [though I'm not sure how safe it would be to consume this, I would use it to anoint my body since almonds can be dangerous if handled incorrectly and if the person wants you to soak almonds in water for an extended period of time, I would be worried it could make you sick]

Could I add a chant? I find that things work out better when I chant

Yes, you can. If something works for you, you can add it to a spell.
