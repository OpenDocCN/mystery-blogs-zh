- en: Black salt is a mixture used by witches for protection and banishing. It is
    one of the many different types of witches salt. It can also absorb negative energy
    in an area so that it may be disposed of.

- en: It is traditionally made with burned cauldron scrapings and ash, mainly from
    the home fireplace, then mixed with salt. There are modernized ways to make black
    salt though, for people who do not have a cauldron, or for those who do not burn
    things in their cauldron. For this reason you can choose to use ashes, black pepper,
    cauldron scrapings, or coal. Or you could use a comination of any of them. If
    you are a household or kitchen witch you could also use charred remains from your
    oven or a pan. I usually use ashes from herbs and insence, and black pepper in
    my black salt.

    over the floor. Give it a few minutes to absorb the negative energy, then sweep
    it up and throw it away outside of your home. You can also put the black salt
    in a satchet and place it in busy or negative areas of your home or workplace.
    You can also put the satchet in your car.
