- en: As one of the primordial deities, I feel that the Goddess Nyx is *vastly* under-appreciated.
    The Greeks didn’t spend much time worshipping Nyx, even though she rules the entire
    element of night!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the Ancient Greek creation story, one of the first elements to exist was
    night. In fact, night was synonymous with the Goddess Nyx, from whom many of the
    other gods were created. Nyx came before even day or light! Some cults even believed
    that she had given rise to everything in the Universe, including the earth, other
    gods, and humans.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nowadays, some witches *do* work with Nyx, but she is still underrepresented.
    She’s a terrific goddess and can be kind as well as stern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nyx can help us uncover the deepest truths in our unconscious mind and learn
    how to be comfortable during the night and in shadow times. After all, she represents
    all things misty, vague, and formless.

    Greeks. In fact, there are no Temples dedicated to Nyx. She only received a few
    small statues scattered throughout Greece.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nyx is a Primordial, which means that she existed (as a deity) from the beginning
    of time. In fact, she is the daughter of Chaos, the first being. Some tales even
    say that Nyx herself was the first being and from her came everything and everyone
    else.

    god of sleep), Thanatos (the god of death), Geras (old age), Nemesis, and the
    Moirai, more commonly known as the Fates.
  prefs: []

- en: The goddess Nyx has so many influential children that one can only guess at
    her powerful she is herself. In mythology, Nyx chose to reside in the Underworld
    and didn’t ask Hades for permission.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, she specifically resides in Tartarus, which is the deepest place in
    the Underworld (and in the world in general) and is a center of suffering and
    torment, where the other Titan prisoners live. Unlike the Titans, Nyx herself
    chose to live here, and made herself available to those who were brave enough
    to seek her out for divination purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Nyx resides in one of the most terrifying places, she isn’t depicted as
    evil. In fact, she’s quite moral. She is the goddess of night and presides over
    dreams, sleep, and even beauty, depending on the myth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Witches flock to both of these goddesses in order to understand powers that function
    under the shadow of darkness.
  prefs: []

- en: Nyx was the most well-known, in Ancient times, for riding across the sky and
    bringing night after a long day. Though she wasn’t particularly worshipped, she
    was often thanked for her services to provide a time of rest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in Latin. The coming of night meant an end to a long day of toil and well-deserved
    rest at home.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Goddess Nyx has many appearances, but she is most often portrayed as a young
    woman with black hair, wearing a black cloak made of stars and surrounded by a
    dark mist. Sometimes, she wears a veil instead of a cloak.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nyx is often shown riding in a chariot, too, pulled by either black horses or
    black bulls. She rides through the night sky wearing her cloak and paints the
    night sky with stars. In these depictions, she is usually accompanied by her two
    sons, Hypnos and Thanatos.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She is occasionally depicted with large, black wings that she uses to fly through
    the sky instead of the chariot. She also appears with cats from time to time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because the Goddess Nyx is a primordial, she didn’t have as much clear characterization
    as other elements. She’s thought to simply represent night, so even her appearance
    is a bit murky. She can even appear only as mist or as night itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, the Goddess Nyx dresses in dark colors and often shades her face.
    She represents all things formless, so she can change form at will, but her truest
    construct is night itself.

    powers were never clearly defined by the Greeks. She simply exists as night itself
    and spreads darkness throughout the world at the end of every day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the gods of sleep, dreams, and death. She represents rest, darkness, and endings.

    a cave and was thought to be extremely psychic. Tarot cards and other ancient
    divination methods are linked to Nyx.

    a wonderful deity to call upon when you need to reveal your truest essence or
    gain a deeper sense of awareness. If you’re looking to reveal the truth of a situation,
    Nyx can also be a wonderful goddess to call upon.
  prefs: []

    the future, how to discover hidden answers in your own mind, and to discern those

    deities often reach out to us when they want to work with us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Goddess Nyx tends to reach out in very subtle ways. It can be difficult
    to determine if she’s the goddess reaching out to you, but there are specific
    tells.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Some of the indicators that Goddess Nyx is reaching out to you include:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**1\. You feel a strong connection to the night.** This doesn’t necessarily
    mean that you *aren’t* afraid of the dark, it just means that you feel peaceful
    at night, or maybe you feel as though nighttime is especially important in some
    way.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**2\. Symbols like the stars and the moon appear to you.** If you see these
    symbols pop up over and over, this can be an indicator that Nyx is reaching out
    to you. However, if you’re only seeing the moon, you will want to consider the
    Goddess Selene or another moon deity, as Nyx represents night as a whole instead
    of just the moon.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**3\. You love learning about Nyx.** Researching a specific deity over and
    over is often an indicator that they’re trying to contact you. However, you’ll
    need more symbols than just this, as we can be interested in deities who we are *too*
    similar too instead of deities we can learn from, as well.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**4\. You want to go within and uncover things in your unconscious mind.**
    If you’ve been delving deeper into your locked memories or unconscious mind lately,
    then Nyx may be around you. She’s very good at helping her students deal with
    their most unconscious thoughts, belief, and trauma. However, remember that this
    can be painful, so you should be 100% ready to work with her!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**5\. You’ve dreamed of the Goddess Nyx.** If you’ve had any dreams about Nyx
    or even about night in general, then she may be reaching out to you. Remember
    that Nyx can take any form, including dark mist or night itself. Any dreams that
    seem odd or random should be considered. If you’re not sure whether or not you
    had a legit dream, [check out this post that details the different types of dreams

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although Nyx is the queen of darkness and lives in a shadowy world, she is surprisingly
    willing to work with humans. Like any deity, she’s very strict and requires absolute
    honesty, so you should know what you’re getting into before you start worshipping
    Nyx.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many witches call upon Nyx in their darkest hour. While she is the goddess of
    night, she is also able to reveal the light at the end of the tunnel. She can
    teach you that darkness is nothing to be afraid of, that darkness cannot exist
    without light.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nyx is also a wonderful goddess to call upon if you’re working on your divination
    skills, particularly those relating to prophecy and the future. She can help you
    learn about Tarot readings, crystal ball work, other types of scrying, meditation,
    and even pendulum practice. She’s known to teach astrology, particularly relating
    to the night sky. However, you must be willing to do the *inner* work as well,
    or you can find yourself in over your head.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re ready to connect with the deepest parts of your mind, then you’re
    ready to call upon Nyx. It’s OK to be afraid, but know that everything *will*
    be revealed to you, both good and bad. After all, Nyx is all about the duality
    of light and dark and shows us that not all dark things are bad.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re working with her, the goddess Nyx can feel rather soft or gentle.
    She is formless, like the dark mist of night, but she can turn very quickly if
    you ignore the work of the shadow self.
  prefs: []

    or statue. The goddess Nyx doesn’t require anything too fancy, but she will want
    to know that you’re putting effort into this work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also put a symbol of Nyx under your pillow in order to have prophetic
    dreams. However, as the goddess of the Nyx (and a deity who lives in Tartarus),
    be aware that you may have some “dark” dreams, simply because you’re opening up
    your mind to the darkest pit of the world in dreams.
  prefs: []

    signs may come through dreams or through small associations in real life.
  prefs: []

    Nyx, too. Astral travel can be especially helpful here, but even regular meditation
    can work.

    After all, divination is the specialty of the goddess Nyx.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re working with a deity, you’ll need to keep your eyes open for signs
    over time. Deities will influence your life in very subtle ways, so even though
    it might feel like they’re not around, you’ll find yourself being pushed to work
    on things that fall under the domain of the specific deity.
