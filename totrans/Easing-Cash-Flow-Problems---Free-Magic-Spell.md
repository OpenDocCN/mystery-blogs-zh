*   Cinnamon

*   dried orange peel,

*   basil,

*   patchouli,

*   vervain (all money and active-oriented herbs)

*   A dollar coin

Bless supplies. Empower the brown candle with the desire for money. On the slip of paper, write ''money come, money flow, money dance, money grow'', or any prosperity-themed chant of your choice. Wrap the dollar coin in the slip of paper. Blend the herbs; sprinkle a pinch into the paper packet. Make a slice about halfway into the orange; insert the paper-wrapped coin. Burn remaining herbs on charcoal while holding the orange and chanting the same chant you wrote on the paper. Keep the orange on the altar for seven days.

When to perform this spell: ideally, it should be done between first quarter to full moon. On the day of the full moon, remove the dollar and spend it, preferably in aid of some charity cause. Money needs to move to flow! (For maximum benefit the moon should be in Taurus at either the beginning or the end of the seven days.)
