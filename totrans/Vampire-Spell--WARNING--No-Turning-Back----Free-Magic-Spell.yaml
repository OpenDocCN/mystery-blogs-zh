    it DOES, you'll be more sensitive to pure sunlight than you would have been if
    you did it at night. You won't burn to death like in movies, you'll just get a
    terrible sunburn REALLY fast. And some people have said that they thought they
    were smoking, but who knows! If you do this spell at night, it'll have a 94% chance
    of working. If you do it at night with a full moon, 99%. Like it says in title,
    of this spell works, it's VERY HARD to go back.

- en: Go into a fairly-sized room. Open the biggest center window, and shut off all
    the lights. Close the door, and stand in the middle of the room. If its Full Moon,
    let it shine you. Stand up straight. Close your eyes and meditate, filling it
    with blankness. Do this for exactly a minute. KEEP YOUR MIND BLANK. I KNOW IT'S
    HARD :0). Then, say the incantation clearly 10 times. Then meditate for 10 more
    seconds, and say quietly but clearly ''It is done.''.

- en: DemigodGirl, you said that you did this spell on yourself and your friend did
    it. Does it really work? Also, if you ''Don't'' drink nor taste blood, then you
    don't want it? Just curious...

    other that claims to shape-shift, does not work. Please do be careful with drinking
    blood. There's many diseases that can be transmitted through it, also it can be
    toxic to your own body.

    magick, so you can't become a vampire. This is a fake spell that has been floating
    around the internet for over a decade, you can't change your genetics or physical
    form with magick, and you also can't become a different species.
