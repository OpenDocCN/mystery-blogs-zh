- en: This course is a result of many years of experience with teaching Witchcraft
    and seeing the hurdles students are facing at the beginning of their journey.
    My aim was to create a course that is not based on a specific witchcraft tradition,
    but instead gives students a **solid foundation** in the basic principles that
    many witchcraft traditions have in common. The course was designed to give students
    a head start on their own unique journey to **discover their own magick**.
