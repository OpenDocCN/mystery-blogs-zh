- en: This spell will not physically change you, just non-physically/ how your magic
    sees you and may change a few personality traits vaiguely. You'll feel your wolf
    form how you did the spell (it's fake but you can do it for fun)!

    wolf spell is last bold, if you're new to magic I put 2 spells to help above this.

- en: Relax in a small space, and call your magic. Do not ask other magical beings
    for help or this will not work, as it relies on your own magic's sentience and
    asking for others may make your magic feel as if it isn't needed and you expect
    others to do it for you.

- en: Relax and focus think of your actual standing. In other words what traits describe
    you most and accurately. Take a breath and focus on your hand, then you'll kinda
    feel your magic or another presence, similar to yours vague, yet different. This
    is your magic, a bit weak now but will grow over time if you treat it well. If
    it does start a bit strong let it know your limits. Think of what your ideas of
    too far are so it knows.

    first, least you don't catch the attention of anything on the mindscape like a
    passing daymare. May be useful before the wolf spell too. Here's one i'd recommend.

    from you. Like intellect, self control and the like, your magic will supply the
    wolf ones.

- en: Close your eyes and think of the place you feel, metaphorically, at home at.
    You should see a person who feels familiar, but is different/you haven't likely
    seen them before yet they have an aura that's right in your oppenion. Since you
    did the pertection spell, this person is your magic. In that home place, how you
    imagined the wolf, but with vary slight differences you should see it. Keep your
    magic close and just sorta let the wolf sniff you, it should how and turn to a
    warm (well your oppenion of warm) wind. Let it strike a breeze around the land,
    then thank your magic. You've now become a non-physical warewolf.

    Again this is non-physical.
