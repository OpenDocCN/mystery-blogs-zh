    would harbour results. However, this is calling on the ''Goddess of Aphrodite''
    as well as a physical sense to assist you in the spell. Is this the Goddess Aphrodite?
    Why call upon her? Do you work with her? Does she rule over what you desire? What
    offering will you give as thanks for assistance? If this is not a typo, what is
    the Aphrodite, if not the Greek Goddess? Is this like Hades is a God and a place?
    Is there an Aphrodite land, or was this made up by the author? As for call on
    sight, sound, touch, taste, in your spell, is this similar to calling on the elements?
    How does that work? Are they spirits, the literal senses, or deities associated
    with the sensations? Understand why things are the way they are in a spell can
    help you determine if a spell works or requires an edit.
