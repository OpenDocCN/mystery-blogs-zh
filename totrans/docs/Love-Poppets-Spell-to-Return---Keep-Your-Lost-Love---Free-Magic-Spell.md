## Casting Instructions for 'Love Poppets Spell to Return & Keep Your Lost Love'

These poppets are to represent you and him/her. With any sympathetic Magick what is done to the poppets is done to the lovers. A poppet is a specially constructed cloth doll. It is a simple rough figure from 2 pieces of cloth. While cutting the cloth, concentrate on who it will represent.

It may then be worked on further with embroidering it with facial features, special characteristics such as a beard, moustache, long hair, etc. Even astrological signs and the person's name can be embroidered onto the doll to help symbolize who it represents. Sew the figure leaving the top open. The figure should then be stuffed with the appropriate herbs again concentrating on the person.

You must use any 3 or more of these love herbs: Verbena, Vervain, Rosemary, Rose petals, Cinnamon, Patchouli, Yarrow, Valerian, Catnip, Lavender, Rosebuds, Strawberry leaves, Jasmine or Ginger may be used.

(These herbs are ruled by Venus) Along with the love herbs; .add to your lover's poppet, some of your moon-blood (a powerful option), some of your pubic hair and some of your underarm hair (don't shave your armpits for a few days if this spell is to work well!)

The top may then be sewn closed. The two figures must be prepared this way. One representing each of the lovers.

Now name the figures as you hold them focusing on the intent of the spell - him/her returning to you. Say: ''Your name is ----- you are now his/her/my---- true essence''.

Bind the figures face to face with red ribbon or thread.

Now ''put them to bed'' in small box and keep safe. Each day at the same time exactly, dress a red candle with rose or jasmine oil or even olive oil massaging it in from the ends to the middle to imbue it as a tool of Magick with your personal Magick and energy - also you may have both your names inscribed on it inside a heart shape (with a sharp pin) and burn it for 15 minutes holding the poppets, focusing on your ex-lover and willing him to return thinking of all the loving times you have spent together and picturing in your mind you both together. Holding the bound poppets high up over the candle so the poppets get warm a little but do not get too hot.

Now Say: ''I melt your heart as I melt this wax __name__ even as this wax flows, So your love glows stronger for me I melt your heart as I melt this wax.

Even as this wax flows, So your love flows back stronger to me, I melt your heart as I melt this wax Even as this wax flows.

So you are reminded of all your love for me I melt your heart as I melt this wax, And by fire of love and it's molten flow.

Return __name__ and your love for me show. I call __name__ back to (your) __name__ so mote it be!

Say last line 3x3 times.
