Why the 'whatever'? (so annoying...)

Bare bones explanation. Begin by deciding what you want to achieve with the spell. If you have a preference of spell type such as candle or potion, choose the process you wish to use. The next step is research. If you wish to cast a friendship spell, research herbs, colour, crystals, whatever you wish to use that has friendship energy. For you first spell, less is more. Stick to three to five items so you are not overwhelmed and you do not muddy the energy since items have multiple energies to them. If you wish to say a chant, write one, but it is not required. Once complete, journal about how you feel before the spell, then cast, journal how you felt during and after the casting, and finally, keep record of anything you sense for the month following the casting. That way you can see how well it worked and if you need to edit anything for future casting.
