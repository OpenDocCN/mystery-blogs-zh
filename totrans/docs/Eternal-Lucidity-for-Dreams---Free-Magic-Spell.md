Can someone tell me if this works or not? If no one responds, I'm gonna try it myself.

I would not light candles if you are casting a sleep/dream spell. A chant can set your intentions, but you will need to improve your abilities in dreams.

I dont light candles while doing this spell, as it could be a fire hazard,
