## Is Today Your Birthday?

You may want to put certain aspects of your old life behind you for good but you won’t be able to do that until you have tied up various emotional loose ends. Make that your goal for the next six months – and the six months after that will be amazing.

### AQUARIUS

Cosmic activity in the travel and social areas of your chart urge you to get out into the world and have some fun. Don’t worry that your financial and work situations are still under a menacing cloud – there are much brighter skies up ahead.

### PISCES

Both Mercury and Venus have now left your sign but chances are you won’t notice much difference over the next few days. The momentum you have built up in recent weeks will carry you along at speed for quite a way yet. It’s still a great ride.

### ARIES

Your lust for life has been nothing to write home about in recent weeks but now both Venus and Mercury have moved into your sign your enthusiasm should start to pick up once more. The good days are here again. The great days won’t be far behind.

### TAURUS

Don’t allow a minor setback to knock you off your stride. You are still well ahead of the game, both at work and in your private life, so stay calm and carry on as before. There is no such thing as failure – every setback makes you stronger.

### GEMINI

If you are in any way dissatisfied with your life, this is the time to make changes. There are two things you must do: first, draw up a long-term goal; second, work toward that goal each and every day. Small steps become giant leaps over time.

### CANCER

You are in the middle of a run of excellent luck, and long may it continue. Having said that, you may need to up your game on the work front over the next few days. The more rivals try to talk you down the more you must talk yourself up.

### LEO

You may not want to admit that you got it wrong but you can no longer hide the fact that a financial decision you took a while back has not worked out for the best. You need to be brave and own up to that fact, then do something about it.

### VIRGO

There may be no obvious reason why a loved one is behaving badly but the fact is they are and you must decide what you are going to do about it. As a first move you might want to ask them what’s wrong. It could be something really simple.

### LIBRA

You have pushed yourself hard on the work front in recent weeks and have made considerable progress, but as your ruling planet Venus has now changed signs you need to focus on more personal relationships. Love is more important than labor.

### SCORPIO

Something that seemed so simple a week ago now looks hugely complicated. The reason could be that you have got too close to the situation and need to step back a bit so you can see it from several angles. It’s still simple, if you know how to look.

### SAGITTARIUS

A friend has got themselves worked up over a ridiculously trivial matter and it falls to you to get their head straight again. Yes, give them a shoulder to cry on but get them to look at the situation logically as well – then tell them to get a grip!

### CAPRICORN

Everything has been going so well of late that you know there has to be a catch. What a negative way of thinking! There is no reason at all why today, and tomorrow, should not be as good as, if not better than, all the days that went before. Be positive.
