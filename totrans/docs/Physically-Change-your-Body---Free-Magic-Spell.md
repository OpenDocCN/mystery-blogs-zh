You cannot physically transform. Magick is an energy and only effects energy.

You cannot physically shapeshift with Real Magik.

This is a transfiguration spell

Does not matter, it is fake.

Magick can do anything as long as you have intent and conviction

Incorrect. Real Magik on the physical plane is a natural energy, ruled by nature, and undefiant of natural law. If a spell contradicts nature, it does not work on the physical plane. Physical change, transformation, transfiguration as seen in films is not in human nature, ergo no spell will create these results.

Tadashi is correct. On different planes of existence magick can do more, but we live on the physical plane. On the physical plane, magick is in the domain of nature. Magick on the physical follows natural law. It brings natural change, and while you might be able to do more powerful things with practice [weather magick, illusions, ancestral curses] humans aren't the type of magickal being that can break natural law and do unnatural spells. Our realm has fairly strict rules. No amount of belief will change that fact.

I don't believe the narrative that magick cannot break the laws of nature

We can control magick Hence we can control nature and natural world

You can learn to use magick, but the energy has its limits on the physical. We are part of a large magickal ecosystem, and humans [while able to cast great spells] are fairly low on that food chain. Magick on the physical is a force of nature, it can't contradict nature being part of nature. Don't be so arrogant as to think we can bend things to our will. We are but small specks in the grand order of the universe. I suggest checking your ego, doing some shadow work and doing more research on magick and witchcraft.
