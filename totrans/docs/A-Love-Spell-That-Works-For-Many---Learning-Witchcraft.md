Over the centuries, many love spells have been created by young women eager to find someone. This is one of these spells and it has worked for many of the people who have cast it. With this being the case, there is no reason why it should not work for you as well.

**What You Need**

You will need a very fragrance, very fresh red rose.

You will also require 2 red candles.

These are the only items you will need for this spell.

**Casting The Spell**

You will need to consecrate the rose and candles, but before you do this, you need to find out what time sunrise will be the next morning. After finding this out, you will need to place the rose and the candles on your altar with a candle on either side of the rose. You can also leave a suitable talisman or crystal with the candles as this can enhance the spell.

This should be left overnight and you will need to take the rose outside at sunrise the next morning. Breathe in the sweet fragrance of the rose and hold it in front of you. You should focus on the rose for a moment or 2 before saying:

*Flower of love, please let it be,*

*The true love is coming to me,*

*And let it be done, that it harm no one.*

After saying this, you will need to return to the altar and place the rose between the candles then light them. Focus on the flames of the candles and see true love in the heart of the one that you want to attract. If you have no single person in mind for the spell, you should bring to mind someone with the features and personality that you find attractive.

You need to keep the candles burning until the rose loses its bloom then extinguish them. You will then need to bury the rose in your garden. If you do not have a garden, you can press the rose between the pages of your favorite book.
