The Einherjar is a powerful magical being that is the reanimated soul of a Viking warrior who has been deemed worthy by Odin. They resemble bodiless suits of armor or phantoms in Viking attire. They are always armed.

SURVIVING AN EINHERJAR ENCOUNTER:

The Einherjar are controlled by a binding rune (as you will read below) so using spells to break the rune and the control your enemy has over the Einherjar is always a valid option. Einherjar will not attack anyone on their own. Another method is exorcism, though it is not likely that you will be able to exorcise a rampaging spirit-warrior before it does you in with its axes. A final way to stop an Einherjar's attack is taking advantage of its honor. If the creature breaks its honor, it will be banished from Valhalla and it will immediately discorporate. For example, it is against an Einherjar's honor to hurt an innocent woman or child unless they are associated with a foe. By not defending themself, a woman or child can prevent attack by this spirit because it knows that to kill them is to kill itself. DO NOT attempt to fight an Einherjar. YOU WILL LOSE. They are immune to all physical attack and most magic.

TO CONTROL AN EINHERJAR:

If you manage to summon an Einherjar, it can be bound to serve you rather easily. Simply inscribe the symbol of Odin (the Valknut) onto its chest, then form over it the Norse rune naudr/nauthiz--the rune of binding. The Einherjar will be bound to follow your commands until it is released, it is destroyed, or you are killed. Renew the spell daily to make sure nothing goes wrong with it.
