**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Lighter

*   Peice of wood(wood chips are best)

*   Water

Go outside
Make sure you have water near you.
Get out your lighter and hold it near the wood. Keep burning it until a quarter of the wood is solid black (except the red from the sparks left over). As soon as this is done, stick the entire piece of wood in the water.
If you want the chalk to have magical qualities chant this:
As the physical fire is doused let the fire within burn strong(chant 3x)
Then when you pull it out say:
Let this chalk be charged with the powers of all it has touched, earth, fire, and water
So mote it be
Now you have your chalk. To use just write on something with the black end. If chalk is magical, this chalk is good for making doors for teleportation and if you use it to draw a pentagram on the center of your chest (if put in water, don't worry it will not burn you(; )
you will have stronger magical powers in the elements listed in the spell. This lasts until the pentagram gets washed/fades away.
