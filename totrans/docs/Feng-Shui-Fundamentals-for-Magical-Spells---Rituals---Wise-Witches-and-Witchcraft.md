One of the wonderful aspects of Neo-Paganism is the fact that we can use various spiritual systems to enhance our own efforts. When something is meaningful and makes sense, there is no harm in trying it out respectfully. Feng Shui is one of those systems that’s very adaptable and not overly difficult to learn and then add to spell or ritual constructs.

## Feng Shui Background

Feng Shui started thousands of years ago in China as a form of Geomancy. The basic goal of Feng Shui is that of optimizing the flow of life energy (called Qi) in our personal spaces. By arranging things in specific manners and adding symbolic colors and decorations, we end up with a framework that encourages happiness, harmony, health, wealth and one that also supports magical practices. This article reviews some simple Feng Shui tips that can improve the overall vibrations in our spells and rituals.

## Feng Shui for the Sacred Circle

Wherever you work magic is a special place. You want it to be different, inspiring, uplifting, and resonating with positive energy. Feng Shui gives us some tips for making any area feel just like that.

### Creating Peace and Positivity

Practitioners of Feng Shui first review a space and then determine what needs to be done. For example, fresh air and natural lighting are very important for healthy Qi. Open those windows (when practicable) and draw back the curtains. You will probably discern a shift in your home nearly immediately. Other suggestions from the Feng Shui philosophy include:

As you can see, the ideas behind Feng Shui are pragmatic and represent a focus on inner and outer tranquillity. While there will always be times that our spiritual pursuits become chaotic, having a space filled with good vibrations provides that “ahhhh” feeling. That’s how you want to feel before enacting spells and rituals – safe, comfortable and positive.

## Timing Counts

Many Witches and Pagans like to choose auspicious timing for enacting Magick. Choosing this timing correctly supports the overall theme of the spell, ritual, or whatever. There are similar ideas in Eastern philosophies. They, too, suggested specific times as being beneficial to similarly specific types of energy. To understand this better, just think of it like adding another leg to the “table” of will and focus, making the whole thing more stable and defined.

### Elements, Directions and Hours

So how do you use Feng Shui timing effectively? Say you were planning to cast a spell that will improve your overall efforts on a beloved project. That would be the Fire Element which is emphasized during the hours of Noon to 3 pm. So, you might try enacting that spell during this timeframe. To go one step further, you could stand in the Southern region of your sacred circle, which also corresponds to the Fire element.

**North:** Water element. Hours of 12 a.m. – 3 a.m.
**Northeast:** Earth Element. Hours of 3 a.m. – 6 a.m.
**East:** Wood Element. Hours of 6 a.m. – 9 a.m.
**Southeast:** Wood Element. Hours of 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.
**South:** Fire Element. Hours of 12 p.m. – 3 p.m.
**Southwest:** Earth Element. Hours of 3 p.m. – 6 p.m.
**West:** Metal Element. Hours of 6 p.m. – 9 p.m.
**Northwest:** Metal Element. Hours of 9 p.m. – 12 p.m.

### Inbetween Hours

[wisew_rectangle_large align=”left”]
Since one region’s energies end and another begins at the same time (such as Fire ending at 3 p.m. and Earth beginning just moments after that) the actual hour points represent in between times when the two energies mix and mingle. Just as the yin-yang symbol blends masculine and feminine attributes into balance, these points on the clock blend elemental and directional energies. In this manner, Feng Shui reminds us of how all things are connected—even things that seem opposite!

### Magical Tip of the Day

Just a reminder: timing colors, and organization all help with manifestation but they’re not the be-all and end-all of magickal practices. If you can’t roll these activities into your effort, don’t sweat it. Just add the Feng Shui concepts to those occasions when you can do so without turning everything else upside down.
