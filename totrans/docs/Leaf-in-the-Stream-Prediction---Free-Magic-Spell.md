**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Large sycamore leaf

 Sit by the stream and cup a large sycamore leaf in both of your hands. look directly at the leaf and ask it a yes or no question. afterwards, keep your hands cupped and slowly lower the leaf into the stream and allow the water to gently release it from your hands. (Be sure to place the leaf "straight" into the water, not sideways)....if the leaf spins clockwise, the answer to your question is yes. If counterclockwise, the answer is no.

This same practice also works for wishes. make a wish and if the leaf spins clockwise, your wish will come true. If counterclockwise, your wish will not come true.
