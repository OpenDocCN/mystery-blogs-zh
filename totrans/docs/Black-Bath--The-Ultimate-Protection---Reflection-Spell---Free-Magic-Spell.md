Interesting cleanse, though I am curious. ...What is 'black destroyer' oil, and how is it made/where does it come from?

that's what I was wondering. Sure doesn't sound like something someone would want to put on themselves.

''black destroyer oil'' is great thing you can find here in SoM's shop, I used it, and I confirm its great! It is used for protection, and yes you can put it on yourself

Aaah ok. I was assuming it was some sort of home-brew recipe.

This does appear to be a working ritual, but I am confused why you use Gaelic and love items. Black Destroyer Oil can be used in curse breakings and banishings, so most of the protection and cleanse is coming from that. The rest of the bath has more to do with self love and beauty. Not saying you *can't* do that, just not a common combination

Thanks for the comment. I usually work with sexual energies and love spells, and that is my work signature, I combine spells in a way so that love and passion powers up and multiply effect of the spell. These ingredients here are used to boost svadhisthana and muladhara, the root and sacral chakras, to build up those lower energies, and make purifying circulation of energies, so as black salt suck out the negativities, those other ingredients push in the positive energies in you. In a way, its like energy dialisis, cleansing all attachments and in same time not leaving emptiness in etheric body nor weaknened spots in aura.

I see, that makes more sense. Thank you for your clarification.
