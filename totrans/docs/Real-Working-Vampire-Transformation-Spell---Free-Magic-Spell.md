Blood Red, Pale Skin, Moonlight Draw Me In.

Then chant this once,

God's and Goddesses of this Earth turn me into what I truly am, for I desire to be a true immortal vampire.

Tell me the side affects because my spell book did not tell me the side affects. Let me know if it really works!üòÅ

You cannot become a vampire.

If you don't believe in magic then why did you sign up for this hmmm.

I do believe in Magic. I am a second generation Wiccan, I have studied Magic my entire life, and I have cast many spells. I joined this site because several of my Pagan friends also use this site. From your profile, I can conclude you are a someone who really likes Harry Potter and has absolutely no clue how Real Magic works and instead lives in her fantasy world of Hogwarts. If you wish to remain in the safety of childhood, fine, but understand there is a difference between fantasy and reality. Real Magic is a natural energy that effects energy, and does not defy nature.

Ok I'm so offended right now. Just because I'm a Harry Potter fan doesn't mean I don't know real magic! I've studied different types of magic my entire life!

I agree with you, it would be cool to bemone a mythological creature. But magik works with earth and nature. And depending on your craft you might work with creatures of the sort.

transfiguration will work

... You do not have a clue about Real Magik and real Witchcraft, do you? Transfiguration is Harry Potter, this is reality. You can keep shouting transfiguration until you are blue in the face, but it will not make it real. Real Magik has been explained to you so many times, Hogward93, I see no point in repeating myself. This will be the last time I say this to you, Harry Potter is not real. Real Magik does not defy nature. Do you need resources on real witchcraft because I will give you some if you do.

Tadashi is telling the truth when it comes to magick on the physical plane. As far as I'm aware, transfiguration isn't real, you're thinking of glamour [which doesn't create physical changes, but it creates the illusion of change. Think of it like make-up, nothing's changed, but you're using something to hide something you want people to overlook] Also, I've started noticing your comments, be careful because you're tip-toeing the roleplaying line [roleplaying is against site rules] Please, read a few articles on magick before commenting again [just to help you not getting gagged for roleplaying]
