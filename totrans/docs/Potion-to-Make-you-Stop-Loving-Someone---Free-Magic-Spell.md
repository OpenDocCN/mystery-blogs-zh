 Begin by lighting the candle and saying once: "Dark sides make me stop loving this man/woman". Say the name of the person you wish to stop loving. Once done, take all the ingredients and put them into a cup. Before drinking, chant the following three times:  "With this potion I banish my feelings for (say his/her full name)forever".

Now drink the potion. Then put the rock at the foot of yourbed (that will turn your love for him/her feelings into hatred). The spell is done, but it only works for some people and there's no guarantee that it will work for everyone.
