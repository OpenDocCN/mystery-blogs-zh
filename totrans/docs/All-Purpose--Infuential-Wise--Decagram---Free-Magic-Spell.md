## Casting Instructions for 'All-Purpose (Infuential-Wise) Decagram'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Paper

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Writing Utensil (Pen, Pencil, ETC)

*   Name of the person or event

*   Concentration

*   (Optional) 1 or 10 drops of your blood depending on how much you wish to amp up the spell.

Draw a Decagram on the sheet of paper. (To draw a Decagram, draw a Pentagram, then turn the paper upside down so it is an upside-down pentagram, then draw a new pentagram over it, turn the paper back to it's previous position) It doesn't have to be perfect. Write the name of the person or event in the center of the Decagram.

Now place your hand over the Decagram and think of your intent, imagine this as energy flowing from your mind, down into your chest, down your arm and into the Decagram through your hand. Once you feel you have infused enough of your intent with the decagram , you are finished.

Also, if you wish to amp up the spell, prick your finger with anything sharp (That is clean, obviously) and put a drop of your blood on the name, or rather, a drop on all 10 point of the Decagram to make it even more powerful.

WARNING: The usage of Blood in magickal workings is VERY POWERFUL AND HARD TO REVERSE. Be sure what you want to happen WILL NOT be something you regret later if you use your Blood with this!

If you have any questions, feel free to message me.
