Pour spring water into a bowl, Ignite wows "opium" and say :   **“I tuck in the magical force** **Magic thrice blessed:** **I bless water and the sweet smoke,** **my voice will let this happen.** **Let the blue sky flow** **As the beautiful songs I sing!”**   Everything must be placed on the window and the windows should be opened. Then Ignite candle and let it burn until the end. Better to spend the night before the day to come.
