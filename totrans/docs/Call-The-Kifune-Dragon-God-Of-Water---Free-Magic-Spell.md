not the name i was taught, but it might be from a different branch. give it a try and see if it works for you, just don't expect a physical Dragon to appear before you, and be sure to thank it for its presence in your circle and wish it a safe journey home when you're done your ritual.

This sounds like nonsense. This is also incomplete. I doubt it works.
