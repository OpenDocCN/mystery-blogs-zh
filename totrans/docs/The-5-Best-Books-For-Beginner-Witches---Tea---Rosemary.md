# The 5 Best Books For Beginner Witches | Tea & Rosemary

> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/the-5-best-books-for-beginner-witches/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/the-5-best-books-for-beginner-witches/#0001-01-01)

Learning is an *essential* piece of witchcraft. Without gathering knowledge, you’re just shooting in the dark.

Even though intuition is really important when you’re practicing, it’s equally as crucial that you know what tools to use and how to cast spells successfully.

The whole point of witchcraft is that you combine intuition *and* knowledge of the elements to create a really powerful spell. Without the knowledge, you’re using affirmations, not practicing the craft.

I *always* recommend that beginner witches do a bit of research before they jump right in. Even now, I spend about 30% of my time that’s devoted to the craft learning.

**Today I’m sharing my 5 favorite (and most essential) books for beginner witches!**

All of these books are staples on my shelf. They’re filled with fundamental information and spell work, and some of them are even free on Kindle Unlimited.

If you’re just starting out, [Buckland’s](https://rstyle.me/+SdNPiovKy7z76tzfi26YRA) really is the OG guide to witchcraft. This is the first book I bought and I’m *still* glad I have it on my bookshelf.

You won’t get a ton of practical advice out of [Buckland’s](https://rstyle.me/+SdNPiovKy7z76tzfi26YRA) (no spells or Tarot spreads), but you will get an overview of *all* the fundamentals you need to know about before you start your journey into witchcraft.

You’ll learn about everything from the history of witchcraft to tools, clothing, names, deities, covens, rituals, marriage rites, birth rites, death rites, meditation, dreams, divination practices, herbalism, healing, Wiccan denominations, and more.

This is the one book I really recommend purchasing in physical form! I still reference it over and over.

If you’re at all interested in using herbs or earthly elements in your craft (as most witches are) then The Green Witch is a great starting point.

I find that [green witchcraft](https://teaandrosemary.com/types-of-witches-types-of-witchcraft/) isn’t just a choice but is somewhat essential. I always ground, use the earth for energy, etc., even though I don’t consider myself solely a green witch.

Most witches love working with living things because of the energy exchange. So many living things are earthly elements, so I really recommend this book for everyone!

This book is also extremely intuitive. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to *connect* but already has some of the practical knowledge.

This is the absolute best book for any witch who wants a full *modern* guide to witchcraft. If you’re currently practicing in your living room or closet with just a few tools then you’ll love this manual.

Not only is there an entire section/mini-grimoire devoted to spells, but this manual also goes over magick, the history of witchcraft, the elements, gods/goddesses, [types of witchcraft](https://teaandrosemary.com/types-of-witches-types-of-witchcraft/), altars, tools, plant magic, and [crystals](https://teaandrosemary.com/crystals-for-psychic-development/). You’ll learn about [love spells](https://teaandrosemary.com/6-ways-a-love-spell-can-go-terribly-wrong/), [potions](https://teaandrosemary.com/divination-potion/), [hexes and jinxes](https://teaandrosemary.com/curses-hexes-and-jinxes-whats-the-difference/), self-care spells, and more.

This book is available for free on Kindle Unlimited!

I talk about this spell book *a lot* on this blog, so you might have seen it mentioned before. In my opinion, this is the absolute best spell book for beginner witches!

Every spell I’ve ever cast from this book has worked perfectly. The spells are all relatively easy to cast, don’t require a ton of ingredients, and the ingredients that *are* used make total sense to me.

There are 10+ sections in this book so you can find everything from love spells to home spells and luck spells. It’s also very easy to alter these spells if needed. Plus, it’s available for free on Kindle Unlimited!

A Witches’ Bible is a super traditional book that goes over *everything* you need to know about witchcraft.

It definitely isn’t as modern as some of the selections above, but if you want to *really *learn about why we practice witchcraft in a certain way and where it all comes from then you’ll love this text.

The rituals explained in this book are especially helpful. It gets into the *how* and *why,* and most of the rituals are easily adapted if you’re a solo practitioner.

This text will certainly answer any lingering questions that you have about the craft and how magic works.

Bear in mind: [A Witches’ Bible](https://rstyle.me/+y8KsUTAcU-foMJb3MoKJxQ) is definitely on the darker side. This isn’t some fun, fluffy, light witchcraft manual; this text is based in history and tradition. Even if you don’t want to practice like this book recommends, I still think it’s a great read for knowledge reasons alone.
