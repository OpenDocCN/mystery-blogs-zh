## Is Today Your Birthday?

Yours is a birthday worth celebrating, with both Mars and the moon promising fantastic things for the coming year. They will be more fantastic still if you join a club, society or movement that reflects your beliefs and ambitions. Join it and lead it!

### Aquarius

Cosmic activity in the most sensitive area of your chart could have you thinking that certain people are out to get you but it isn’t true. You don’t have to look over your shoulder every five minutes. Your enemies, few as they are, cannot hurt you.

### Pisces

With Mars moving into the friendship area of your chart and a new moon in your sign this should be a fun day for you. Forget about serious matters for the next 24 hours – get out into the world and show your fans what star quality looks like.

### Aries

You are going to do so much over the next few weeks but you will accomplish more, and create higher quality work, if you work out some sort of strategy. What is the one thing that inspires you more than anything else? Make that your focus.

### Taurus

As Mars moves into one of the most dynamic areas of your chart this weekend you can and you must set your sights higher than they have been since the start of the year. You know what you want and you know how to get it – so act now.

### Gemini

Cosmic activity in one of the more sensitive areas of your chart means you need to find time to think about and make sense of all the things that have happened in recent months. What lessons can you learn to make the future a more inviting place?

### Cancer

Today’s new moon urges you to get out and about and see and be seen. Work with other people too. What you do alone may have significance to you personally but what you do with others can and will make the world a better place.

### Leo

Don’t waste your time and energy trying to blame other people for what has gone wrong in your life. No matter what excuses you make, and no matter how valid they may be, in the end it always comes back to what you choose to do. So choose.

### Virgo

If your current environment does not stimulate you as much as you would like it to then do something about it. As Mars, planet of energy, moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today you will find it easy to make meaningful changes.

### Libra

You know that changes are needed on the domestic front and with action planet Mars moving into the area of your chart that governs family matters you can and you must take the lead. Loved ones value your judgment, so let them know what you think.

### Scorpio

Friends and relatives will be more demanding than usual this weekend but that’s okay because you want to help them any way you can. However, if you offer advice once and they reject it don’t be too eager to offer it a second time. Let them come to you.

### Sagittarius

There were occasions of late when, inspired by Mars in your sign, you pushed yourself to extremes, and generally speaking it worked out well. Now, however, you need to balance things out by being a bit more laidback. A bit, but not a lot.

### Capricorn

As Mars moves into your sign today you may be tempted to rush in and start doing a dozen things at once but that would be a mistake. Mars remains in your sign for two months, so plan carefully before you take action. Get it right the first time.
