## Casting Instructions for 'Water Blessed by the Eight'

Before starting this spell make sure you are not tiered and that you will not be disturbed during your casting. This spell take up a lot of your energy and can quickly exhaust you if you arent careful, do whatever rituals you feel will boost your energy before starting. Also make sure that were you start the spell wont be disturbed, wont have gusts of wind or sudden leaks as the candles will have to burn out naturally which depending on the candle will take hours.

First make a circle using think black marker pen on a large piece of paper, inside draw an octagram (8 pointed stars). At each point of the star beyond the circle draw a symbol representing each of the following elements, starting at the top and moving clockwise: fire, life, earth, darkness, water, death, air and light. Make sure that the centre of the star is large enough to place a glass or cup. Place a clear glass or cup at the centre of the star. Fill the container with water. The water should be, preferably, filtered and boiled.

Place your hands parallel to the glass, palms pointing towards the glass. Visualise a chord of white energy going from your hands to the water. Now feel the energy flow from your hands to the water. Now start visualising the water change and chant as follows:

First see the water change into flames and chant:

Oh lord of life, curse this water for when I use it on my enemies and take vitality from them
Oh lord of life, bless this water for when I use it on the sick bring life back to them

Oh Lord of death, bless this water for when I empower my rituals so they may reach the other side
Oh lord of death, curse this water for when I use it on my enemies so your shadow hangs over them
Oh lord of death, bless this water for when I use it on the sick so they may no longer feel your presence over them

See the water be filled with air and bubbles:
Oh lord of air bless this water with the power of air and the sky above
Oh Lord of air, bless this water for when I empower my rituals so they may reach the clouds
Oh lord of air, curse this water for when I use it on my enemies and take their breath from their lungs
Oh lord of air, bless this water for when I use it on the sick let them breathe with ease
Oh lord of air empower this water for when I use it on my spells so they may soar into the sky and beyond

See the water glow brightly with white light:
Oh lord of light bless this water with the power of light and vision
Oh Lord of light, bless this water for when I empower my rituals so they may allow me to see all that I must
Oh lord of light, curse this water for when I use it on my enemies, and shine your light on all they wish to keep hidden
Oh lord of light, bless this water for when I use it on the sick let them see they will get well soon
Oh lord of light empower this water for when I use it on my spells so they may brighten the world

Visualise and chant each step 8 times, make sure you keep the cords of energy from your hands flowing into the water the whole time, ensuring a constant flow of energy into the water. Make sure you keep your hands as still as possible throughout the chanting and the visualisation. When you finished chanting for the last time, break the chord of energy from your hands to the water slowly before releasing your hands and moving on to the next step

Then place a small white candle on each point of the octagram, lit them and visualise a white chord of energy going towards the water from the flame. Make sure the candles wont drip wax on the symbols or the octagram. Visualise drops of the element changed water craw from the candle to the water up along the white chord. So a burning drop from the candle over the fire symbol, a black drop from the candle over the darkness symbol and so on. Visualise all the candles having continuous drops going to the water for about a minute. After this leave the water alone. Let the water rest until the candles have all burnt themselves out. Finally bottle the water in an airtight container for later use.

So points:
Do not drink this water; label the container to prevent others from drinking it
Store it in a cool dark place if possible
If you failed to use it before 2 months have passed, throw it away and bless a new batch
When you finished blessing the water you should always sincerely thank the powers you call upon
Finally make sure that when you place the candles there isnt anything flammable nearby, you are going to let them burn out while you can relax at that point in the spell, you should not leave candles unattended
