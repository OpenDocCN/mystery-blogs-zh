In the sandy desert where four paw tracks lay, a shaggy dingo comes to play, the golden fur coloured like the desert sand, eyes like the brown mud around the water hole, with no bark, with no aggression i shall live in peace with humans, i shall only eat kangaroos, with the power to shift into a dingo and back at will, i will prevent myself from being killed, devour my soul with a dingo soul and let me rain as the dingo i become, SO MOTE IT BE!
