# Cherry Blossom Protection

This was thought to me by a former teacher of mine, and can be done by anyone. It requires meditation.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Cherry Blossom Protection'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Find a quiet peaceful place to meditate. Arrange yourself into a comfortable sitting position. Now close your eyes and begin to meditate. Clear your mind, don't let your mind explore earthly troubles, let go for a while and just clear your mind.

Breath in slowly and exhale even slower,do this several times if you have to until your completely relaxed. If you are having trouble clearing that busy mind of yours then try counting backwards from 10 slowly.

Once you have a clear mind, ask for the cherry blossoms, focus in on them on them until you see them in your minds eye. Draw them around you, you can use your arms physically if you wish, but draw them around you;completely surrounded yourself with them. (just like forming a bubble) This is like forming an astral Shield around you with your own aura and it is a very useful form of protection.
