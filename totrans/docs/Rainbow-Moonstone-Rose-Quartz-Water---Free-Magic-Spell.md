**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 rainbow moonstone

*   1 Rose Quartz

*   bottle or vial of some sort

*   a bowl, preferably glass

*   a funnel for pouring the liquid

*   water

(Make sure the stones are cleansed and charged for this before use. As with most spells it is advisable to cast a circle. The best time to make the water is during a Full or Waning moon, but you can make it whenever you need it.)

Place the stones into the bowl and add the water. Leave it in the windowsill where it can soak up the moonlight. The next day, remove the stones from the bowl and pour the water through the funnel and into the container(s). There are two ways to use the water. Either dab it on the skin or drink it and it should help.
