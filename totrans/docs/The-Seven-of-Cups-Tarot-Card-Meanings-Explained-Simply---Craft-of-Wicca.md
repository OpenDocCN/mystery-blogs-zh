### Astrology of the Seven of Cups card

The Seven of Cups tarot card is traditionally associated with the astrological sign of Pisces. Pisces is a water sign and is known for its connection to the emotional realm, intuition, and spirituality.

 The energy of Pisces is often associated with a strong imagination, the ability to daydream and a tendency to get lost in one’s thoughts and emotions.

 In the tarot, the Seven of Cups is often associated with the idea of choice and temptation. The card suggests that an individual is being offered multiple options, each with its own set of potential consequences.

It advises them to be careful and deliberate in their decision-making, as they may be tempted to pursue unrealistic or illusory goals.

 Pisces is also associated with the idea of escapism, and the Seven of Cups can indicate that a person may be using fantasy as a means of avoiding reality. The card may also suggest that the individual is not being honest with themselves about their true desires and that they are deceiving themselves in some way.

 Astrologically, the Seven of Cups can indicate a time when a person’s emotions and intuition are heightened, and they may be more susceptible to self-deception or illusion. It may be a good time for introspection and self-reflection, in order to gain a better understanding of one’s true wants and needs.

 ## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the Seven of Cups card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

 Here is a new interpretation of the Seven of Cups tarot card:

The Seven of Cups tarot card represents the abundance of options and distractions that are available in today’s digital age.

 With the internet and social media, we are constantly bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information, choices, and temptations. It can be easy to get lost in this digital world and lose sight of what is truly important.

 This card could also represent the idea of “FOMO” (fear of missing out) and the pressure to always be “on” and connected, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with one’s own life.

It could also indicate that the individual is struggling to find balance and focus in the face of constant distractions and the pressure to constantly be “on” and connected.

 The modern interpretation of the Seven of Cups suggests that the individual needs to take a step back and carefully consider their options. They should be mindful of the potential consequences of each choice and avoid being swayed by illusions or temptations.

 The card can also suggest that the individual needs to be honest with themselves about what they truly want, and to avoid getting lost in fantasy or daydreaming in the digital age.

It may be a good time for introspection and self-reflection, in order to gain a better understanding of one’s true wants and needs and to find a balance between being connected and disconnecting to find inner peace.
