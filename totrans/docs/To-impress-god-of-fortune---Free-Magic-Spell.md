I'm so curious about the meaning of that Hindu mantra, We should know about the translation first, Am i correct?

Correct. If you don't speak the language, you won't know how to properly pronounce it for one, but more importantly, someone could hand you a spell and say ''this means love for the divine in German'' but in reality, it actually means ''number one combo.'' Yes, there's google translate to double-check the translation, but some might not try. Also, some users just type what they want to say into Google translate, not realizing different languages have different grammatic rules [see those YouTube videos where people put song lyrics through 3 different languages then back to the original language] Now imagine you're calling on a deity and speaking nonsense. How well do you think that will go? The plus side with the divine, there isn't a language barrier. You can speak whatever language you're most comfortable with and they'll understand.
