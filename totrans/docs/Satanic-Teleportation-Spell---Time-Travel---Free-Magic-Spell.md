# Satanic Teleportation Spell - Time Travel

Creates a door to teleport to another location.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Satanic Teleportation Spell - Time Travel'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Say: "Satanic teleportation," then say, "activate." 

I made this spell with a Black Dog statue, and 6 black chicken candles, and 12 black cat black skull candles 12" tall each skull candle, with black chicken blood on all the items forming a 6 point star. Yes, this spell is considered Satanic. 

After casting the spell, you just think about the location you want to go and it will teleport you there, gives you input on spell's specifics. You can time travel with this too. This is more like for non gangs, mobs, mafias, cops, and military sorta thing will not work if one of those.
