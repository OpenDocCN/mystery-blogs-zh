First find yourself a quiet place to meditate. While or after you meditate think of the person you want to forgive you. Come up with your own words if you must, or go with this:

''I (your name) ask for (loved one's name) to forgive me for the things I've done. Allow your heart to open up and set aside the things I've done to you and what you have done to me. Let the next time we speak or meet be more pleasant.'' And from there add in whatever your asking forgiveness for and anything else.

As you think or say the words of forgiven visualize a loving and healing aura surround that person.

For here light your blue first and with it light your pink candle, then your red candle. After you light them meditate and ask that this spell will reach this person and mend any hurt feelings and you broken relationship. From there open your eyes (if closed) and blow out the candles in the order you light them. Think of the good times you've had and visualize an aura/mist of the candle's color swirl around that person then seep into them putting forgiven into there heart.

The time it takes for it to work may vary

what is the use of Pentacle???

pentacles are protection symbols, representing the four elements and spirit [each point is an element] so I think they chose to include it for protection, but you don't seem to need it for the spell to work. If you want to utilize it, just draw one on a piece of paper and leave it on your altar, but I don't think it's required for the spell.

I just did this one tonight. Now to wait for results.

Can I use this spell to stop any drama and let time flow until it can repair the relationship?
