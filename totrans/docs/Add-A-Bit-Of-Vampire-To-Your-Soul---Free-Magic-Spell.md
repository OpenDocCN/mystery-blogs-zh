**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Wand

*   Pentacle

*   Milk

*   Water

*   Any orange cool drink

*   Red food coloring

*   A mirror

 Take the water and pour a quarter glass full. Then add a cap full of the food coloring. Now add the milk as full as you want and add a bit more food coloring. Now put the pentacle on and take your wand, now as you stir it with your wand say, "Acc Duccie Vaducct.". Once you have said that lift your arms in line with your shoulders and tilt your head back. Once you have done that say, "Ooh! Mighty lord of the dark add a part of a vampires soul to mine, so mote it be". Now drink the formula when there is only a quarter glass left stand in front of a mirror and drink the rest while you stare in your eyes. If your eyes start to look glossy then it's working. If your saliva is thick and your throat feels dry it has worked, now you have a piece of a vampire in you. If you are evil you can go around drinking the blood of others and if you are good you can just make the formula again. If you want to stop being a quarter vampire just take the pentacle off.
