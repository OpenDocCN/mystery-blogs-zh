 Repeat as needed...

Maiden, Mother, Crone
Make my mind at ease,
Grant me balance and
Grant me peace,
Goddesses I am with you,
So be with me.
Maiden, Mother, Crone
Make my body at ease,
Grant me with your serenity
And grant my body
With good strengthening,
Oh Goddesses I thank thee,
So Be It, Blessed Be.

(After you feel you have reached a point where you no longer have to chant and have successfully worked up enough energy. You may either choose between meditating until the candles burn out. Of course that might also require someone with there meditation skills down. Otherwise drinking your favorite tea with music going in the back ground while you do something preferably calming, like if you enjoy writing or drawing. Just try to do something relaxing until the candles completely go out.)

I find the chant a little clunky, but I adore this simple spell. It seems like a chant to connect you with the divine, find balance, and renew your spirit. Well done.
