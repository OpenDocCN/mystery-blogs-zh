Will it work if you burn the paper?

Fear is a natural response, but if you are trying to work through and overcome a phobia, this could help with your first step. It will not make a long time fear vanish instantly, but it should help you work through and release it over time coupled with journaling, meditation and therapy depending on the severity of the fear.
