Omfg!!!! This is sooo cooll

Fulgarkinesis is really difficult, Weather Magick is harder.

Be careful though when chanting spells like this especially if you're mentally and emotionally unstable. Your emotions and thoughts affect the results of the spell. I once did this spell while mad and crying and the results were, let's say devastating and has hurt certain people. Well it was my intention to infuse my anger and pain into the spell.

After the spell we do can whenever do this we want

Unless you already work with weather magik, I would not attempt this mostly because of the energy required for these results. This might work better if you have more people because of how much energy is required. Be aware of your natural surroundings, and I advise against tampering with weather since it can have worse consequences than most realize, but this spell seems plausible.

Okay, thus is incredible. Just did the spell and already clouds are rolling in. Always heard from people I'm a powerful person, didn't think I was this powerful. Maybe that's why the death card was always pulled as my mom was pregnant with me. I'll make a huge change in our world, a good one.
