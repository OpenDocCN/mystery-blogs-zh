You could use this whole spell casting to call on Dragons to aid in your spell, but if you expect to become a Dragon or gain powers of a Dragon with this, no. Magick cannot contradict nature.

The chant is not specific, so I doubt it does anything. You can call on dragons to bless objects. You can call on dragons to aid in spells. You need to specify what you need and why. Otherwise, you would be ignored.
