# Annoying Neighbor Move Away

4 Different spells to make someone move away. In all these spells will cause an annoying neighbor to move away from you

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Parchment paper

*   Photo of the chosen one (If possible)

*   Vinegar

*   Small jar with a lid

*   Green candle

*   Ordinary dirt or graveyard dirt

## Casting Instructions for 'Annoying Neighbor Move Away'

 **Simple Move away Spell #1**
When the moon is in a Waning Phase, write on white parchment paper the full name of the person you want to move, along with birth date. Roll up the paper, with a photo if you have one, place inside a bottle of vinegar, then toss into a body of running water, visualize your enemy moving away as the bottle is washed away.

**Move away Spell #2**
Get a small jar or bottle with a lid. On a piece of paper draw a house with a big X thru it. Then write their name on it 9 times on the outside of the house in the picture. Fill the jar with 4 thieves vinegar, cap and cast into a moving body of water.

You can also intensify this with splashing War Water on their outside door knobs and their porch. As you do this.... visualizing them packed up and moving.... driving away down the street away from their house.

**Go far away Spell #3**
Find a green candle, one large enough to burn 30 minutes a day for at least a week. Make up a short chant something like this:

"Bothersome neighbors go away,
find a much better place to stay.
A place where you will be happy,
I will be happy,
and all around you will be happy.
An affordable place, a nice place,
A much better place to stay
So long as it is far from me and mine.
Bothersome neighbors go away."

It'd be better to make up your own, especially if you can personalize it to the people in question. Just make it positive and upbeat. The idea here is that you are helping these folks find something better than they have now and helping yourself to peace and quiet at the same time.

You'll also need paper and something 2 draw with.

Each night light your candle (cast a circle first if you want one), imagining the flame as a spark in their mind which will lead them to a new home. Then sit down an stare into the flame for 5-10 minutes concentrating on your desire that they find a new, better place to live where they will be happy and annoy no one.

Then take up your pen and paper and draw while chanting your chant. Stick figure art is okay if that is the best you can do. The first night draw your neighbor's (current) house with them doing the annoying types of things they do. Make it complete even if it's simple art. Put in the trees, windows, and the like. When you are done, wait for the end of the 30 minutes, concentrating on the candle flame and your goal. Fold the paper up and tear it to small shreds. Put out your candle (and close your circle if you created one. Save the torn scraps of paper.

On each night for the rest of the week, repeat the ritual, but the art will change. On the second day, draw them excited and happy in front of their current house -- because they've found a better one. For the rest of the week, draw them carrying various stuff out of their current house (as if they were moving). The key thing here is only show there current house. You don't want to limit possibilities by drawing a new house for them.

After you've done this a week, put all of the scraps of paper and some of the tail end of the candle in an envelope and bury it or hide it on the property line between their place and yours. If you've used large sheets of paper, you only need to include a portion from each if you need to keep the envelope small.

**Go far away Spell #4**
This spell needs to be done during a Waning Moon. The day and time does not matter. Gather all of your supplies. Pour the dirt into the bowl. Place the candle in the center of the dirt. (Use a candle holder if using a taper, a pillar candle will stand on its own. Light the candle and concentrate on the person you would like to move. Repeat the following incantation three times:

"Sand from lands far away
name will go and I will stay
Both of us, happy will be
With name far from me."

Deliver a portion of the sand to the person for seven days in a row. You can use the mail but you'll have to deliver it yourself on Sunday. You don't have to hand it the person, just stick it in their mailbox or lay it against their door.
