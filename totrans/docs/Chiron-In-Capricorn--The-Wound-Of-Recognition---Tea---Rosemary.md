Chiron shows our most challenging wounds. Chiron in Capricorn is the wound of recognition, but it can bleed into many areas of your life and is not just job-related.

Chiron is always very clear. It would be almost impossible for you to *not* see your wound. Every so often, you are reminded that your wound exists; this feels painful but is actually beneficial because this will force you to heal the wound.

Chiron in Capricorn is especially hard to forget because it’s all about society and being *around* other people.

## The Chiron In Capricorn Wound

This Chiron in Capricorn wound is all about your need for achievement. You feel unrecognized, unnoticed, and unheard, no matter how hard you try.

You probably feel as though you just fade into the background, especially in the area of the house where you Chiron sits.

This Chironic wounds means that *all* you really want is respect. You just want to be noticed and heard, but this is also the one thing you can never seem to get.

### How The Chironic Wound Will Show Itself

If you have Chiron in Capricorn, you probably work *really* hard to try and achieve some sort of social status or public well-being.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re a social climber. You might just be super socially conscious of what you say and how you say it, do a lot for the general public, work really hard in your career to try and get noticed, etc. A lot of this will of course depend on the house that your Chiron sits in.

With Chiron in Capricorn, you’re really ambitious in some way, but you get wounded over and over when your efforts go unrecognized. You constantly feel like a failure.

Chiron in Capricorn won’t be very obvious to other people unless they look closely at you. To others, you tend to look like a hardworking individual, but you’re trying *so hard* because you’re in pain.

Sometimes, those with Chiron in Capricorn might give up. This will typically happen later in life. They might resign themselves to a life of obscurity, but could also fall into depression or addictions because they haven’t yet worked through the wound.

I also find that those with Chiron in Capricorn are really focused on structure. They believe that if they give their life enough structure then they will achieve what they desire.

Because of this belief, Chiron in Capricorn folks might either control others (especially in the house of their Chiron) or put themselves in a position to *be* controlled by others.

For example, the Chiron in Capricorn person may control their spouse, their children, their schedule, their job, etc., or they may found a spouse who controls *them* or sign up for a career in a controlling environment, like the military.

Most of these control issues will resolve themselves as the Chiron in Capricorn person works through the core wound.

### Where Does The Chiron In Capricorn Wound Come From?

The Chiron in Capricorn wound can be developed a lot of different ways.

Many individuals develop this wound in childhood because they are never recognized or noticed by the adults around them. They aren’t given a voice, and their opinions don’t matter. They just can’t seem to catch up to everyone else.

Alternatively, this wound might have been developed in a past life. The individual might have *needed* to be noticed; it was a matter of life and death. For example, one might have worked for a King and been put to death or shunned if the individual wasn’t well-liked.

Most often, I find that this wound comes from some combination of both types of traumas.

### How to Heal Chiron in Capricorn

Chiron in Capricorn is all about excelling in the *eyes of others.* This is because you are looking for acceptance and esteem from others yet you don’t have that for yourself.

The healing path is to learn to listen to your own voice instead of what society tells you success and acceptance looks like.

If you have Chiron in Capricorn, you need to spend time learning to hear the *soul of your spirit.* Your consciousness is fragmented and only you can assimilate it.

When you learn to speak to your inner voice, you will discovery what your true purpose on earth is.

Your need for control will dissipate when you realize that you have control over your own soul and your own path. Working with energy can help those with Chiron in Capricorn learn how to harness control in a positive and powerful way.
