## Save Money Spell

A spell that allows you to save money on everyday expenses.

You must have a clear idea of what you want to achieve, as well as how much you are willing to spend.

Save your money and find financial freedom with this spell and rhyming intention.

### Ingredients

*   Fresh basil leaves (for prosperity – dried will do in a pinch)
*   Cinnamon sticks (for prosperity and success)
*   Citrine crystals (for manifestation and prosperity)
*   Peppermint essential oil (for success and luck)
*   1 Green candle (for prosperity and success)
*   1 jar (for saving money)
*   Starter money (as much or as little as you like)

### Directions

Anoint your candle with the peppermint essential oil while repeating this rhyme:

*Money to come*

*Money to stay*

*I’ll keep my money*

*It won’t go away*

Add cinnamon sticks, basil, and starter money to your money saving jar.

While holding the citrine crystals, repeat the rhyme:

*Money to come*

*Money to stay*

*I’ll keep my money*

*It won’t go away*

Place the citrine inside of the jar.

Light your candle and, holding it sideways, allow some of the wax to drip into the jar.

Place the rest of the candle, still lit, someplace fire proof where it can burn down fully.

With the candle still lit, take the jar in your hands and close your eyes.

Envision the jar filling up with dollars and coins. It’s becoming heavier and heavier, and soon it’s overflowing.

The coins are spilling onto the table, and yet more money is coming to you, appearing in the jar.

Set the jar next to the candle as it burns down. Thank the universe for all the wealth it gives you.
