# An Introduction To Mundane Astrology: Nations, Politics, & Big Events

> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/mundane-astrology/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/mundane-astrology/#0001-01-01)

There are many different branches of astrology. Mundane astrology is the branch of astrology governing places, countries, cities, entities, corporations, geographical events, and the world.

In natal astrology we study a single person’s chart, but in mundane astrology, we study something larger, something that’s more established.

The term Mundane astrology comes from the Latin word *mundus*, meaning world. It’s quite literally the astrology of the world!

Mundane astrology shows us what is happening in the world due to the gravitational pull of the planets. It can be used to predict the future and prepare for possible events.

## Why Study Mundane Astrology?

If you believe that Mundane astrology is true, then you could theoretically predict world events. Even if we can’t actually do anything to change these events (as this is usually impossible because the energy of the planets is *so* strong), you can still be prepared for what is coming.

For example, the United States is entering its Pluto return right now. This only happens about every 250 years, so this is the first Pluto return for the US.

Looking at the chart helps me a *lot* because I can try to figure out what I think is going to happen and prepare.

Just before the stay-at-home order hit, astrologers were predicting some sort of massive lockdown. In fact, Mundane astrologers had been speaking up about the year 2020 for over 50 years! Mundane astrology can be super helpful if you’re interested in the astrology of politics.

I also love using Mundane astrology for my business in order to work with the energies.

Even if you only study Mundane astrology for your own amusement, it will at the very least help you be prepared while you become a better astrologer and learn more about various placements.

## How To Read A Mundane Astrology Chart:

To draw up a Mundane astrology chart, you do the exact same thing as you would with your own chart. 

For a nation or country, you simply need the birth date and place of the country. This is usually the “official” time and place that the country or nation came into existence. For the United States, we use the date, place, and time the Declaration of Independence was signed.

However, you can also use the first official inauguration if there is no clear date as to when the nation truly began.

You do the same type of thing for a business, entity, town, city, or other place or thing. If you don’t have a specific birth time then you can either use your best guess, use 12pm (and omit references to the points and houses), or you can [use your pendulum](https://teaandrosemary.com/pendulum-dowsing-101/) to determine a birth time that both looks and feels correct.

A Mundane astrology chart will look the same as any other, but the signs, houses, and planets have slightly different meanings that clearly apply to bigger entities.

## A Caution About Mundane Astrology:

I hate to say that but, after having the fear of GOD put in me one too many times when I was first starting out, I feel it’s necessary.

**Don’t believe everything you read!** Many Mundane astrologers will present their opinion like it’s fact.

For example, with upcoming Pluto return, I have heard that our government will be overturned, that the world will explode because of climate issues, and that we will move to another planet. I mean seriously? Other countries have made it through their Pluto returns, but some haven’t. So at the end of the day, who knows?

We’re all just guessing based on our own associations, our experiences, and the history that we have researched.

Additionally, *many* astrologers let their own political, social, or ethical beliefs influence what they see in a chart. Most of us do this sometimes (it’s really hard not to) but it’s also really important to look at the chart objectively.

If we just see what we want to see then we won’t be prepared. So, if an astrologer is giving you a bunch of good news that goes against common sense and the current climate, don’t put too much stock into that.

However, don’t believe the astrologers who *only* present doom and gloom, either. Usually, what’s going to happen in somewhere in the middle of the two extremes.

Always trust your gut over any blog post! I’m definitely not correct 100% of the time and I don’t imagine that anyone else is, either. We are all influenced by our experiences and our biases.

## What Do The Signs Mean In Mundane Astrology?

I won’t list out the meanings of the signs here because, in Mundane astrology, you can read the signs as you would regularly. 

However, the meanings of the planets and the houses are very different, so I’ll go into those below!

I recommend looking at the planet/house first and then applying the meaning of the sign to the aspect using your regular knowledge of the sign’s elements and qualities.

## What Do The Planets Mean In Mundane Astrology?

In my opinion, the planets are *very* important in the Mundane astrology chart. I recommend looking at the planets first and seeing what you can pick out in a chart.

### The Sun:

In Mundane astrology, the Sun represents the leaders and people in authority positions. These are the folks that the public does or *must* look up to. The Sun would represent prime ministers, kings, emperors, presidents, magistrates, judges, etc.

Sometimes, the Sun can represent individuals who the public listens to, even if they aren’t technically in an authority position. This authority is bestowed by the people.

In a Mundane “natal” chart, the Sun can also represent the force or will of the nation/country.

### The Moon:

If the Sun is the leader, the Moon represents. the people in general. Sometimes this is all of the people, while other times the Moon can represent women more specifically. It also indicates crowds.

Alternatively, the Moon can represent anything to do with water (including transport, conditions, etc.) as well as land and crops.

The Moon almost always shows where the public’s *attention* falls. Anything that draws a crowd or that people notice is related to the Moon.

### Mercury:

Mercury represents anything relating to news and media. This includes newspapers, TV channels, books, publishers, the press, speakers, news commentators, professors, and intellectuals. Sometimes, Mercury can also represent what is being taught or conveyed intellectually.

In Mundane astrology, Mercury can indicate transportation (usually public) as well as communication.

### Venus:

Venus represents artists, musicians, actors, athletes, theater, festivals, children, courtship, and marriage. Everything relating to beauty and entertainment is Venus.

When Venus is badly aspected, the beauty and harmony of a country will suffer.

### Mars:

Mars represents the military (the navy, the army, the air force, etc.), the local police, attacks on the country, disputes, conflict, and opposition. Anything relating to fire will show in Mars when looking at the Mundane astrology chart.

However, Mars can also represent leaders who aren’t in the public eye, such as engineers, military leaders, and doctors. This planet can also show epidemics, crimes of violence, and more commotions. If something violent is happening, look to Mars first.

### Jupiter:

In Mundane astrology, Jupiter is a bit of a duality. It represents the religious community as well as the judicial system.

Priests, religious leaders, bankers, judges, and lawyers are all represented in Jupiter. Because Jupiter rules both expansive finances *and* philosophy, it can show things relating to order, peace, prosperity, religious beliefs, and more.

### Saturn:

Saturn represents the *local* law enforcement and the minor executives. For example, Saturn in the United States tends to represent the executive branches of each state or city.

Alternatively, Saturn can represent civil servant employees, land owners, mine operators, any public buildings or parks, and the elderly population.

In a more negative sense, Saturn shows epidemics, large-scale tragedy, public sadness, national calamities, and scarcities.

### Uranus:

Uranus is the black sheep of the Mundane astrology chart. It represents political tension of all natures. When Uranus shows up, the people are trying to break out of the mold.

Typically, Uranus specifically shows rioting, strikes, and breaks for individualism. It can sometimes indicate right wing politics (more on the Libertarian side) but can also show scientific discoveries and inventions.

Uranus governs air and rail transport as well as labor organizations, explosions, anarchy, and the electrical and radio industry.

### Neptune:

If Uranus leans right then Neptune leans left, towards socialism and communism. However, Neptune can also represent socialized medicine and hospitalization, charities, covet plots, fraud, illicit activities, and loss.

Neptune in certain aspects can indicate illusion. It can show when the people are unable to see what’s real, and it can show the illusions that a country or nation projects to the rest of the world.

However, Neptune represents the spirituality of a country as well. This is on a much deeper level than religion. It can indicate drugs or addictions on a mass-scale.

Pluto:

At its best, Pluto represents change and rebirth. In any chart, Pluto is all about metamorphosis and regeneration, regardless of how painful that may be.

In Mundane astrology, Pluto can indicate *many* things. Some of these include political undergrounds, espionage, organized crime, wealth, power, control, violence, rape, death, hidden information, organized labor, mob psychology, and the collective unconscious of the nation.

### The Ascendant:

The Ascendant shows how the country/nation/entity/corporation is viewed by others. Aspects to the ascendant can more specifically show if the entity is viewed in a positive or negative light.

## What Do The Houses Mean In Mundane Astrology?

Although I think the planets are super important in Mundane astrology, I definitely recommend that you do some research into the houses, too. Here’s my description of the houses and what they rule in Mundane astrology.

### The 1st House:

In Mundane astrology, the 1st house rules the country as a whole. It also shows how the country/city/entity/corporation comes across to others, because this is where the Ascendant sits.

When you’re looking at transits, pay special attention to anything in the 1st house. These planets will affect the country as a whole. Most huge events show up in the 1st house.

### The 2nd House:

The 2nd house rules the wealth of a nation, the economy, currency, revenue, banks, the Stock Exchange, financial institutions, money market, and trade. 

It also rules the possessions or property of people as a whole. Anything material is ruled by the 2nd house. 

Planets in the 2nd house will affect the finances or economy of the country, nation, or corporation.

### The 3rd House:

The 3rd house rules all sorts of short-term transportation such as travel by car, bus, subway, or bike. Because the 3rd house is communication, it shows everything relating to information and news, such as the Post Office, the media, the news, internet, telephones, magazines, publications, and newspapers.

It can also rule young people and education or places of learning. 

Generally, the 3rd house will show the way that information is relayed and received in a country. Any planets transiting the 3rd house will affect either the reception or the output of information.

### The 4th House:

The 4th house is the foundation. It rules the home, land owners, and workers of the land, as well as foundational cities and the basis for which individuals are working/voting. Sometimes, the 4th house also rules the weather.

Because the 4th house is opposite the 10th (which generally rules the leaders or people in power), it’s all about the common person/family unit. It’s usually a direct contrast with the leaders and may indicate where the country came from or how it was initially created. 

### The 5th House:

The 5th house rules theater, sporting events, places of amusement and entertainment, gambling, and social functions. It shows how the people find hobbies and spend their free time; it’s all about what folks do for fun as a society. What things are considered recreational? The 5th house will show this.

However, this house can also rule the birth rate, children (and how they’re raised), and sexual concerns. 

### The 6th House:

The 6th house rules public health, hospitals, healthcare, and epidemics. However, it also rules trade unions, national services, civil servants of the country, and workers and employees of a company.

This house can show a country’s general attitude towards work and health.

### The 7th House:

The 7th house rules foreign affairs, relations with other countries (for better or worse), and the national marriage/divorce rate.

It shows the “other parties” involved with the nation/country/corporation. It can also indicate other people involved in an event who are victims.

### The 8th House:

The 8th house rules the death rate, the types of people who die, how the nation treats death, and financial relations with foreign countries. It can also indicate how much debt a country or corporation is in as well as loans, interest, and taxes.

The 8th house can also be relevant the people are feeling oppressed or there is some sort of power struggle.

### The 9th House:

The 9th house rules higher education (college or university), professors, and philosophic and scientific institutions as well as religion, churches, and religious influence on the public.

However, the 9th house can also rule long distance travel by a plane or boat or places of recreational/large events. The 9th house also governs law and the judicial systems.

### The 10th House:

The 10th house shows the person or people in power (such as the monarch or president) and the government in general. Sometimes, the 10th house can also rule famous people, even if they’re not actually in positions of power.

In a more national sense, the 10th house rules reputation, credit, power, and public employment rate.

When a planet is transiting the 10th house, it will impact the leaders of the nation/corporation or the government or ruling entity as a whole. This house is especially relevant when studying the astrology of politics.

### The 11th House:

The 11th house rules the masses and groups. Mob psychology is definitely present here. The 11th house is especially useful if you’re looking at a Mundane astrology chart for an event.

However, most “rebellious” periods or times of change have to do with the 11th house. Idealism and hope is also represented here.

### The 12th House:

The 12th house rules places of confinement such as prisons, hospitals, asylums, secret societies, and occult religions. It also rules the people who work or live in these places.

It also rules endings and can indicate how an event or reign will end.

When a planet transits the 12th house, this usually indicates that something hidden will come to light.
