# Isis Girdle( Energy Spell)

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This spell is one based on knot magic and is used to ensure that your energy is at the right level for your magical work. Buckles, belts or girdles were often associated with Isis or Venus and therefore aspects of femininity. They represent physical well-being and moral strength. It can be performed on a Wednesday.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Isis Girdle( Energy Spell)'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 lengths of cord about 3 metres (9 feet) each

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 lengths of cord about 3 metres (9 feet) each

 Decide before you begin the purpose of your girdle. To specifically use one for health issues you might choose the colour blue, or to work from-a spiritual perspective choose purple orwhite. Begin braiding the cord and as you do so bear in mind that you are fashioning three aspects-of self, body mind and spirit to become one-source of power in all that you do. In this way the braid becomes an extension of -you and also a protector of your being.

Call on the power of Isis as you do so to give you strength and determination. Tie a knot in both ends to tie in the power. Now consecrate the girdle by holding it in-your left hand and circling it three time-santiclockwise with your most powerful hand,while saying words such as:

"Isis, Mistress of the words of power
Cleanse this girdle for my use"

See it surrounded by bright light and glowing brightly. Let the image fade. Next circle the girdle clockwise three times -with your power hand and say:

"Isis, Goddess of the Throne
Protect me from all ill"

Again perceive the girdle surrounded by light. Next put the girdle round your waist and say:

"Isis, Goddess of Perceived Truth
Thy wisdom is reality"

In future, each time you put on the girdle you-should be able to sense the energy, giving you the power to carry out your chosen task.

This is quite a powerful spell to do. Not only does it-protect you from illness, it also prepares you to be-able to help others as they require it. Since Isis rules-intuition, you find that you are in a better position-to understand others pain and distress.
