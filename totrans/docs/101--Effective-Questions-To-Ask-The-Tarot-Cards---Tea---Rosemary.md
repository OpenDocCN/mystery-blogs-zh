I practice with my Tarot cards almost daily, so I know how hard it is to actually think of questions to ask the Tarot cards. Once you’ve gone through all the main issues, you’ve run out of queries, but you may still want to practice.

After coming up with so many of my questions to ask the Tarot cards during my own practice, I decided to put together this post of 101+ questions for the Tarot cards!

## A Few Tips Regarding Questions To Ask The Tarot Cards…

Open-ended questions are always better when thinking of questions to ask the Tarot cards. While you *can* work with the Tarot if you want to produce a yes or no answer, it’s better to use open-ended questions for practice. Therefore, all 101 examples of questions to ask the Tarot cards are open-ended.

Additionally, try to ask questions that you actually have control over. For example, don’t ask what your friend can do to make *you* happier, since you have no control over whether or not your friend does it. Take back your control and empower yourself with these Tarot questions!

Lastly, if you’re just learning Tarot, use a deck that’s good for beginners. [I recommend this classic deck](https://rstyle.me/+o41WAvvI9nX5E1W9zZ-azg) for absolute beginners.
