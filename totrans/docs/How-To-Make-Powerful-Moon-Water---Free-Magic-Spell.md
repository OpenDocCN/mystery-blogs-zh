My former friend told me that if you pray to the goddess Nyx, then the moon water will be more powerful. You can do anything with moon water. Hex, use it in spells, curse, and more.

 During  a full moon, but a glass bowl of water outside, or a place where the moonlight will shine on the water. Pray to Nyxe for 30 minutes, then leave and go to bed, but leave the bowl of water where it is. Overnight it will become moonwater. But YOU MUST take the bowl of water ( now moon water), and take it away before sunlight shines on it, or IT WILL NOT WORK, and then put a lid on the bowl and label it Moon Water. Glass cups work too.

WHAT MOON WATER CAN DO: 

It can hex, how to make money, used in spells, and more. My former friend told me this. You might find that spells using moon water has a higher chance of working.

This is incorrect. IT takes all night to make, not thirty minutes. The specific type of full moon can also effect the type of energy of the water. If you do not work with Nyx, do not call on her. Also, she is not the Goddess of the moon, she is the Goddess of the night, there is a difference. You do not need to call on any deity to make moon water, you are charging the water with the moons energy. All you need is water, some say distilled, and something to hold it, like a bottle, and that is it. You are correct you need to retrieve it before the sun rises, but it does not mean the moon water will not work. The water will have lunar and solar energy. It can still be used, but it will not be as potent as pure moon water.

Moon water is used for divination, purification, cleansing, and spells you wish to include the moons energy to. It is not traditionally used for hexes. It is used in hex breaking.
