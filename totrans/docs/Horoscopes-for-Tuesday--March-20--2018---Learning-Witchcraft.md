## Is Today Your Birthday?

A Venus-Mercury link in your sign on your birthday means you have the gift of persuasion and you must use it to the full. What you say must be meaningful, of course, but your delivery must be perfect too – and it will be.

### Aquarius

The Sun moves into the most sociable area of your chart today and almost immediately you will be making plans about where to go and who to see. Don’t do it all at once and exhaust yourself though. Keep something in reserve.

### Pisces

Make peace with someone you have fallen out with in recent weeks. Looking back you will realize it wasn’t such a big deal, certainly not the kind of thing you would want to sacrifice a friendship for. Say sorry and move on together.

### Aries

Almost anyone will do almost anything for you now. Do you take advantage of the situation? Of course you do! As the Sun moves into your sign you have the cosmic right to grab what you can get – so long as it does not belong to anyone else!

### Taurus

You must not allow yourself to be intimidated by people who shout and make a scene. The planets indicate it is just an act to make themselves look bigger and more important than they really are. Ignore them and they’ll go away.

### Gemini

You probably won’t be in the mood for work today but that’s okay. You will accomplish more in the long-term if you slow down and give your physical, mental and emotional batteries a chance to recharge. They’re all running a bit low.

### Cancer

You must not allow your standards to slip now that the Sun is moving into the career area of your chart. Employers and other important people will be watching you closely, and may even put you to the test, so make sure they are impressed.

### Leo

Anyone who tries to tempt you to do something you instinctively know is wrong must be told in no uncertain terms that you have no intention of falling for their tricks. The Sun moves in your favor today so there is no need to cheat.

### Virgo

Today’s Venus-Mercury link means you need to be on your guard, especially when dealing with people who know how to play on your fears. Take what they tell you with a large pinch of salt. Find out the facts for yourself.

### Libra

Anyone who thinks you are too laidback for your own good will have to think again when they see how energetically you go after your dreams. Don’t waste time on thinking – do what needs to be done with all your heart and strength.

### Scorpio

Your feelings are close to the surface at the moment but there is a danger you will become overly sensitive and start putting other people’s needs ahead of your own. The planets warn you should be looking out for number one.

### Sagittarius

The Sun moves into the most dynamic area of your chart today and you can sense that a more positive phase is beginning. Your confidence will be so high over the next few weeks that if you put a name to your dreams they will surely come true.

### Capricorn

Try not to be quite so wasteful with your resources. The past few weeks have been a fun time for socializing and to say you have been generous is a huge understatement. You cannot afford to keep paying for people out of your own pocket.
