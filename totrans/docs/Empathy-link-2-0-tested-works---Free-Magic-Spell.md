Percy Jackson is fiction, therefor one can assume this spell is fake.

Yep, but spells like this one exist. This person has just worded it wrong as they probably didn't have another example

you cannot add fiction character to your spell, because it is not natural and it is imaginary, not real

This is faker then your profile pic

This is fake and does not work.
