# Werewolf Spell (tested myself/works)

  Rated 3/5 Stars

This is a spell I have seen many times before, although i have tested it and it DOES work. It can be done either at day or night and you MUST believe in the spell in order for it to work. This spell will allow you to physically shift into a werewolf and back as you please.

*   Belief in the spell

i also forgot to add one side effect in which should be very obvious. You may also obtained severe anger issues

this spell does not work, doesn't matter if you claim it does, real magick doesn't contradict nature, and since humans cannot transform [sorry to burst your bubble but physical werewolves are not real] this spell is 100% fake

Why does the door need to be able to lock

I would assume it would so you would not be disturbed. However this spell is fake, and cannot work so it wouldnt matter if the door was locked or not.

To the people saying the spell is fake, or doesnt work, I hope to you know how rude you are being. Im sorry if this is offensive, but nobody asked you. If the spell didnt work for you, thats too bad, it didnt work, oh well. But others who want to try this spell, either just for fun or because they actually believe, dont necessarily want your this spell does not work this is not possible comments. Im sorry but I personally find these comments annoying and unnecessary. Thank you for understanding, please just keep those comments to yourself.

Just pretend those ? Are 

WHAT THE HALDBSKK RHEHS its correcting the apostrophes to question marks I dont understannnddd

Regarding the question marks, the site does that sometimes [especially if you type in a different language] two, we are trying to educate people on real magick so they don't waste time/energy on fake spells, get discouraged and leave the path. If you want to play make believe, fine, but not on this site since it's for real pagans to discuss real paganism, not nonsense

How long does it take for this to work

This spell won't show results. Magick cannot change our species, genetics or physical form; breaking natural laws isn't possible. Werewolves also aren't real, and so you cannot become a werewolf.

hi!!! i am a few months over 13 years old is it still safe to do??

All spells are safe at any age, provided you know ''the basics'' of magick. How new are you to witchcraft? I can mail you a list of resources to help you start if you'd like.

you guys it legit says for this to work you need to believe in this spell!!! how can it be fake if you dont believe

Don't believe everything you read. People can lie very easily online. Magick is an energy found in nature. On the physical plane [the one we live on] it's ruled by nature and cannot contradict it. Werewolves are astral beings [from a different plane of existence] they don't exist on the physical plane. Magick on the physical plane effects the energy around us to attract/repel a desired change in our lives. If it's possible naturally, it's possible, if it contradicts nature, it's impossible. No amount of believe will change that. [try the spell yourself to see] You can work with werewolves similar to deities, Dragons, or spirits [among others] you can call on their symbolism to influence your spiritual path, you can look into spirit animals and spirit totems [though I would caution your on it being borderline cultural appropriation] You can even dress like a werewolf if you desire [there is also people known as otherkin, they're humans but they have an animal spirit. physically, they're human, it doesn't give them shapeshifting powers, they just have a spiritual connection] Unfortunately physically transforming into a werewolf isn't possible. Take care. All the best on your path.

You cannot physically transform.
