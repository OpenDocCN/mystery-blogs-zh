For the love oil, you can use a purchased blend designed for love, or make your own oil. A mixture of vanilla, rose, ylang ylang, cardamom and/or ginger oils will make a potent love blend.

Put a few drops of oil on your palms and rub your hands together with the lodestones to anoint them with oil. Rub the stones until your hands begin to feel warm. Concentrate on drawing love and romance into your life with these stones.

Drop both lodestones into the red bag, then rub the bag in your hands to get some oil on it too. Place the charm bag on your bedside table, or hang from a bedpost to start attracting your next true love.
