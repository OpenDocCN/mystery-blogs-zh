# Avian/Angel/Whatever Wings

  Rated 5/5 Stars

I made a twist for the future avians and stuff so you can gain wings.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Avian/Angel/Whatever Wings'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Close your eyes. Visualize your desired wings. Feel them upon your back. Feel the fluttering of your wings now. Can you feel your blood flowing through the veins in your wings? Let it fill you with joy, happiness, and peace of mind. Visualize the color of your wings now. Allow that color to flood your mind. Now let that color flow from your mind to your fresh, pure white wings on your back, the color is filling them up with your energy. Say this incantation once you see them appear in your minds eye:

"Great Goddess of nature and the spirits of the wind, let these wings grow upon my back. Allow me to no longer be human, but the avian (or angel) that I have wished to be. Let these wings rise from my back in exactly one lunar cycle.

Mother Earth, allow the clay used to make me be shaped one more. With my wings I've always dreamed, allow my eyes to change to the purest ___. I will be forever grateful, and ever humble.

O' great Goddess and wind spirits, I will never do evil as long as these wings lay upon my back. I will always do what I believe in and what is right. I shall never let darkness tempt me to defy my oath. If I do evil, you may remove these wings from my back, as I will not be deserving of them."

After you said the spell, imagine your wings shimmering with new found power. Then open your eyes.

You cannot grow physical wings.

Did you read it from here with your eyes open? They need to be closed.

open or closed, it won't matter, you cannot grow physical wings. try astral projection if you wish to fly.
