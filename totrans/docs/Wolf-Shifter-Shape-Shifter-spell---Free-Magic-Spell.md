Hi do this spell really work ? Please answer

Physical shifting is impossible.

Rhododendron i belive Physical shifting as possible

Why is it impossible

Do that means that i can¬ít shift ?

It's impossible because magick cannot change us physically, we cannot suddenly shapeshift because we cast a spell, it simply isn't how it works. We cannot transform into another species whether real or fantasy, just like we cannot change our genetics with magick.

It's scientifically impossible. Magick is a natural force; it has to work with science. Some people practice shifting on the astral plane, but no one can do it physically.

@ 100times6, physical shapeshift is not possible. Multiple people have explained this on numerous spells. Claiming otherwise would be considered roleplaying [which is a rule violation] and could get your account gagged [same with spamming the comments section with the same point over and over]

What thing do I have to do be wolf shapeshifter ? Please help me i really want to be wolf shapeshifter It¬ís my dream

You can't be, physical shapeshifters are not real, you cannot magickally transform into a wolf and back again, it isn't possible. At best look into the astral plane, but in the physical world, this is simply not possible.

Dude you just have to believe in Magic and the spell and in yourself for it to work

Belief is a key part of magick, but theres still laws to consider. You can believe the earth is flat, butnit won't make it flat. You may believe gravity isn't real, but it won't make you fly. Magick is a natural energy. Its ruled by nature and cannot contradict nature. This claims to create an unnatural physical change. On the physical, this won't happen, regardless of how much you believe it will. Look into astral projection or mental shifting.

You cannot physically transform.

Well, yes, use you're mind

Hi I did this spell last month and would it still work out for me, I did it on the end of last month or was that too much out for it to work.

This spell cannot work. You are human and will always be such. You cannot become any other sort of creature but human.

I May sound, stupid i simply don't care, because belive it's a part, of the first age, if so it can make unknown things, to happen, and to all who just Thinking, it's not possible to shift forms, but have you tried? If so and it didn't work, then simply do it agian, and agian, self if you don't think it would work, because belive, Hope, and nature, it's just a step closer to dreams, if that said, then someone can't say anything, because have they tried. Have they tried so hard, that they felt over, and just got a black out, in the middel of, an spell, i don't think so. So then come and use this spell, because some time it would work. Let me give you, an example, do you use, a phone, or screen, reading this, if so then i can, tell you that, wouldn't had happend if, the first maker of the, phone, followed the outers, and stoppede making process, he kept making process, until a phone was made. Hope you enjoyed reading all this.

Have you tried breaking a brick wall down by slamming your head against it? Just believe and keep bashing your head into that brick wall. Did you hurt yourself? Well, that just means you are not trying hard enough. Keep believing you can break through that brick wall with nothing but your head, and if anyone tells you that you cannot break that brick wall, then they are just haters who do not believe. I mean, have they even tried breaking down a brick wall by smashing their skull against it for hours?

Please do not hit your head against a brick wall, I was using this as an example, not as a suggestion.

We know certain things are and are not possible because we studied and gained the knowledge through the years. Magik on the physical is a natural energy that brings natural change. Humans cannot will themselves to shapeshift by nature, ergo Magik will not either. It defies natural law, which governs Magik. If you refuse to listen to those who know more about Magik and attempt one of these spells, nothing is going to happen. Nobody is going to track you down and force you to stop, but nobody is going to say ''I told you so'' either. We are simply stating facts so new members do not waste their time on fake spells.

Now, if you wish to work with astral werewolves or animal spirits, you can. If you wish to use the symbolism of werewolves in your craft, you can. If you wish to astrally or mentally shift into a werewolf, you can as well. There are ways to tweak these broken spells to make them work. You can shift your expectations to align with reality. You can still feel empowered by werewolves. The only thing those witches are trying to do is explain no amount of belief will change reality. Magik is a neutral energy that brings natural change. Spells change the vibration of this energy to attract or repel the desired outcome. This energy only effects energy. It does not do physical changes like shapeshifting.

It was difficult to understand with your random punctuations, but as Tadashi said, no. No amount of belief will change reality. You can believe the earth is flat, but it'll still be round. You could believe you could fly by flapping your arms. You could do this every day, but it won't change the fact humans can't physically fly by nature. Humans are inventors by nature, so a spell to inspire you to create a new flying device is in the realm of possibility. Same with transformation. Werewolves are astral beings, you can work with them as part of your spiritual team. On other planes of existence [mental, astral, ethereal] magick has less rigid rules and more is possible. No amount of conviction, belief or practice will make you physically transform with magick, but you can use it in other ways to achieve a similar goal.

@100times6 There's fictional magic, and there's real magic. Fictional magic sometimes allows fictional characters to do things that would violate the laws of physics in the real world. Sometimes those methods are flushed out and explained, and sometimes the magic is just a convenient plot device for making things happen. The magic that's talked about on this site doesn't have that ability. That said, I believe that magic can sometimes do things that can't be explained, but I highly, highly doubt that it can allow someone to transform their physical body no matter how much they tried. Feel free to try if you wish, but prepare for a lot of disappointment.

Who warships the devil, May gain un natual powers, it's like saying belive is belive, dummies you think physical shapeshifters want to prove there secretsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Tadashi Belive is something you do, it's not a force, and don't you think Cia will keep hiding there secretsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Who belive in gods, should see, who belives in Universe should gain, modem pepole don't belive in magic as I know it. YUP there are not a lot of information on my profile, What's that you can't reply. Or are you still a person who doesn't understand, what things can do. Draq belive is good, keep dreaming and they may reveal for you. Tadashi you Japanese or is it just a name you like, it doesn't have any mening in this text, Destroy a wall is easy self with your head, it may hurt in the start, but your skull would get stronger and stronger, The monks in china are so strong that It would take years for you, to even win agianst them. They could destory thousands of walls and didn't had tanken any damage. belive is a path not given power. Nekoshema agian a Japanese or someone who watchs anime, physically, reality, universe, bypassing the physical laws is possible pepole just don't want to reveal there secrets, you see nature is strong belive it or not, but nature makes so many things, and so many dark things. Nature is strong and belive is hope, but is talking to humans also physically, reality, impossible yes of you go decades back, when hunters were hunters and were animals live together, by belive and keep beliving can gain our self un natual powers, you know work smart not hard, keep your goal free and wish for your deams. 100times6 are you a kid or are you really what you want to be, dreams is the goal to luck keep dreaming and they may reveal them self, keep belive in your dreams if You want to learn to shapeshift, May the wish be on your side.

Hello, Supernova, I see you want my attention. Since I can tell communication with you will be pointless, I will just give a quick rundown of your points and never speak to you again because I do not feed attention seeking trolls. And before you claim you are not one, why else would you post any of this? There is a difference between a random question, valid criticism, and a poorly worded hissy fit.

For starters, do not refer to Native people of Turtle Island as *the Indians.* Especially when you are perpetuating a stereotype. Yes, there are certain tribes who believe in transformation into an animal form **however,** this is not something every Indigenous person can do or believe in. Those who do believe it is a gift only the wisest shaman of the tribe can learn. So, let us assume in this instance it is possible. Even if it *is* possible, which it is not, only a handful of spiritual masters can do it. No spell you found online will make you a werewolf. Do you honestly believe a shaman would post the most sacred ritual on a forum site that is primarily visited by teenagers?! Because if you do, I should warn you about secret messages in songs when you play the recording backwards. And while I am confused by your devil worshiper line, I assume you think they are blessed with satanic powers? No. You will not gain special powers if you work with a certain deity. Those who work with Lucifer work with him to heal trauma, not for nefarious intent. As for a literal Satan, the number who pray to the Christian devil is incredibly low. Most Satanists are Atheist's.

Belief: an acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists. trust, faith, or confidence in someone or something.

Now that everyone has read the definition of belief, you will see it is an ***acceptance*** of somethings with an ***absence*** of proof. Belief is what you think, your practice/craft is what you do.

Conspiracy trite, conspiracy trite, mediocre attempt at a taunt, skipping all of that. Tadashi is the name of one of my pets. I could not think of a username and saw him and went *that works.* Believe me, if I could change my name, I would go with something more Germanic in nature. As for your question of my heritage, I am a combination of UK European (Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland respectably) and Indigenous Canadian (Metis) since you asked.

**Lmfao!** Breaking your skull over and over makes it stronger?! Thank you, that has been one of the best laughs I have had on this site in a while. Racism aside, that is not remotely true, and not even close to any martial arts practice.

There are things beyond our comprehension, but not the nonsense you claim to be real. I hope you accept reality and learn Real Magik one day. But, until I see any effort on your part, this will be the only time I entertain you, so do not bother me again. Blessed be.

Please don't spam the comments, 4supernova. If something can be contained in a single reply, keep it in one reply. [posting sentences to add to a point, multiple posts for replies to multiple people or other posts which could all go into one is considered spam and against site rules. Only corrections and occasional ''Forgot this point'' double posts are okay. [I'm also including your below comment since you appear to repeat yourself in both, rendering half of your comments pointless] Also, there's a strict ''No roleplaying'' rule on this site you're close to breaking with your unfounded claims. Please review the site rules to ensure you don't make any other rule violations that could get your account gagged.

As for your comments directed at me, please read any above explanations from myself, Draq, HearthWitch, Prsna [User393658], Rhodendron, Tadashi, or Weide as I'm not in the mood to repeat myself. As for my username, I've explained this A LOT on this site [might just post it on my profile if it would help] when I was little, I was babysat by a Japanese lady who taught me some Japanese and introduced me to the culture which I've been fascinated in ever since [yes, I like anime, but I also know the language, history, and culture of Japan because it's one of the thing's I studied growing up] As a little kid, I made up a story about some cats, each one was just named ''Number cat'' [nekoichi, nekoni, so on] and my favourite was Nekoshi [forth cat] and would use that name a lot in stories and games I'd play. In middle school, I was going through a bit of a goth phase and learned ''Shi'' was another word for ''Death'' and the character's name became ''Death cat.'' I added the ''Ma'' to the end when I learned about its meaning as this land of nothing place in Japanese folklore. So, all through my teens [and to this day because branding] my username across platforms is Nekoshema [the ''she'' being spelled ''she'' and not ''she'' was because I was a girl and wanted people to know that. Because 12] So, there you go, the history of my username. If you find a Nekoshema somewhere online, there is a 99% chance it's me [which means I really should delete my more embarrassing fanfics before Google rats me out for stuff I posted in my teens] However, I hope you're not trying to pull an ''On behalf of the Japanese, how dare you use Nihongo for a username'' because that's ridiculous. Japanese isn't a closed practice, nobody is claiming to be Japanese, and the only people who are getting hurt are those who actually know Japanese and are cringing at the bad Japanese names on display. Believe me, you're doing more cultural damage by perpetuating the indigenous stereotypes, not only the inappropriate term but the tribe who believes in shapeshifting becoming ''All natives believe this.'' The Quileute tribe does believe the greatest shaman can learn to shapeshift, but it does not mean everyone can and every indigenous person believes this culturally. The Quileute have been fighting to undo this stereotype popularized by Stephanie Meyer but people keep coming to their towns and asking about it. [blessing and a curse, really, as it gets tourists which generates money]

4supernova what are takling about??

Why Are you replying the user doesn't care

AlphaChange what are you seeking after

Why Are so many replying, I don't care about your opinions, belive and think what you wantüò≠

'' The law of physics you say i have some ideas that would eleminate the laws it's not the time for fights but The time for love they said'' Draq

@ 100times6, I know it can get annoying when people comment under your comment and have their own conversation in the process, however, that's how the spell section works. Anyone can reply to your comment [provided they adhere to guidelines. Since the replies are about whether or not this spell is possible, nobody's broken the rules by going off topic] @ AlphaChange, as I mentioned earlier, please keep your posts to 1 thread. Multiple replies which could go into a single response would be considered spamming the comments and could get your account gagged [4supernova, I've already warned you, please stop breaking the rules or your account can be gagged]

Bypassing goal: Pepole say ''Physical shifting is impossible'' ''physical shapeshift is not possible'' but you know what, I don't care, about what pepole belive and don't belive, I know from the fact of unknows, that shape shifting is possible. What about the Indians is that also lies, *No it's not* belive is a strong Word, there tons of proof, The us gov, hidden it. Like area 51, Cia, FBI, etc. They All hides something from normal Innocents, you don't belive me, it's fair you don't have to belive me. But there so many proof, of unkown things coming to the surface, what about the pyramids?? they exist, So belive it or not. You can't tell if shapeshift works or not, it's like religion, ghosts, and ancient nature energy. Pepole with un natural powers, pepole who can shapeshift, they don't want to be seen by outhers. There so many things to belive, If You want to belive in shapeshifting do it, Cuz it's your wish, you the only one that can get it to happen. Be the wolf you want to be, wish and blive it to get it to happen. You can do it, regards FsupOernoUvaR

Grow up, you are not in a Hollywood movie.

Weide, who knows there are No proof of it

You will never shift into mythical being, ever. It is not and will not be possible in a physical world. I would rather believe in ''energy vampires'' who ''sucks'' your good energy to make you feel bad, other than that - having fangs, sucking on a human/animal blood, turning into a bad - no, I will never believe in that. I will leave that imagination for movies and stories. And yes, there is no proof because anything like that has never happened. You can't keep living in a world of fantasy for long, you'll grew out of it one day. As a child, I had a strong belief that I could become a mermaid every single time I took a bath but once you grew up, you realise that it's all just fantasy and it's not possible.

Rather, believe in that you have strong connection with wolfs like physically living wolfs as animals, dogs etc. Perhaps the associations that wolfs howl on the Full Moon - you could be connected to the Moon and it's energy. in my case, I would be connected to water and it's true as it helps me focus and feel grounded.

Fine I'll let my friend see the point

People of the older epoch, entrenched in their understanding, fail to fathom the metamorphosis within. Unveil my essence in the future, where I, a potent entity, stand as a testament to the fusion of humanity and belief. Those who dissent, blind to the tapestry of my soul, deny the transcendent reality where I, the wolf shifter, defy the laws of the physical realm. Within the incantation's ethereal embrace, I invoke the gods and goddesses of the spiritual realm. Grant me the power, the shift, the essence of the wolf. With fervent will, I merge my soul with the mighty wolf, transcending the limitations perceived by mere mortals. As the eyes turn yellow with anger, and the howls echo through the realms, the disbelievers remain ensnared in the illusion of their convictions. So mote it be!

Edited: In the tapestry of dissent, behold the weaving threads of skepticism, clinging to the mundane. They question the essence of transformation, scoffing at the prospect of a metamorphosis beyond the boundaries of conventional thought. Yet, within my core, a resonance pulses¬óan unwavering belief in the extraordinary. As the tapestry unfolds, the revelation dawns: I am the harbinger of a power, a force that defies the shackles of doubt. For within me, a fusion of humanity and something more profound manifests, traversing realms unseen. To those who deny the prospect of shape-shifting, I extend an invitation to witness the inexplicable. My soul, not merely halved but transcending the laws of physics, stands as testament to the boundless potential within. As I gaze into the future, a powerful being emerges, guided by trust in select souls. In the face of opposition, I remain undeterred, for the spell of skepticism holds no sway over the alchemy within. No incantations, no rituals, just the silent affirmation of a truth known only to those who dare to believe in the extraordinary.

In a found link, it's suggested that shapeshifting is real. Check it out: Shapeshifting Link

https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-real-spells-to-become-a-shapeshifter

Also People may disagree, asserting the impossibility of shape-shifting. Despite their skepticism, I hold a firm belief that goes beyond conventional understanding. My journey involves surpassing the limits of ordinary existence, embracing a powerful identity where my conviction intersects with human essence. Regarding the debate on shape-shifting, a spell is discussed. This spell claims to turn one into a Wolf Shifter, accompanied by various side effects like headaches, stomachaches, and a connection to dogs. While skeptics may dismiss it, I maintain a sense of certainty that surpasses their skepticism. This is not just a fanciful tale; it's an exploration of personal boundaries and the uncharted territories of belief.

The trouble lies in there being a distinction between exploration, and delusion. And that di ide canbe very small and easily crossed. And, moreover, when crossed it is capable of causing great harm. Harm which goes beyond spiritual and emotional confusion into the realm of psychosis, self-harm, societal isolation, and in documented legal cases it has resulted in murder on multiple occasions.

This is not a harmless path to follow, and requires incredible study, understanding, and a firm hold on perspective. One that must be very carefully maintained throughout one's chosen journey, no matter what journey you are following. So allow .e to be very deliberate and clear on a few things. (This is going to be a long one, so strap in.)

Historically and presently, Shapeshifting has indeed been recognized and acknowledged as a genuine practice. -

however

- This entails Shamanistic, spiritual, and (sometimes) hallucinogenic journeys used to take other mental, emotional, and philosophical traits of an animal. Or, the term'shapeshifting' has also been co-opted as a term referring to deep personal change through Self-realization and actualization.

Such changes are achieved temporarily through use of ritual, often involving intense dance and mind-altering substances along with willful mimicry of how the animal moves and behaves in order to draw forward what the animal represents. The enacted would also at times wear a costume, usually made from as many parts of the actual animal as possible. Feathers, pelts, masks, ribbons and beads and other decorations. The goal being to embody the nature of the animal in order to invoke its qualities or to control the animal in some way. (For example as a form of prayer to bring the hunting herds to the tribe or to set then on a path to being found).

While it has been described by those observing such a ritual as the invoker becoming **as** the animal, they do not physically change in any way. They costume as the animal. They move like the animal, they enter the -headspace- of the animal. But in no way. At all, do they physically become the animal in body.

As a side note, bezerker practices are definitively the same. Trained elite warriors who are stronger and more skilled than average as a result of training and experience, who may or may not have used hallucinogenic substances along with emotional and mental evoking of anger, determination, or otherwise 'pumping up' to stimulate adrenaline and bypass survival instincts (along with pain reactions) to fight more effectively through brutality, intimidation, and sheer force of will. To become as a bear. Not a bear itself.

To physically shapeshift, in any form or capacity, for any length of time, is absolutely and unequivocally impossible through the use of will/magic. Period. It is as constant as gravity. So long as a particle has any measure of mass, it will be drawn to any larger measure of mass. It is intrinsic to how mass works. No matter how fiercely you believe you can fly, jump, and you will land.

**However**

Through dream work, astral travel, and mental exploration one -can- shapeshift on levels that are outside the physical. Through practice, meditation, and apication of purpose one can engage in magical and meditative practices to explore the more fluid energetic forms and mental/observational perspectives of a non-human image. The critical part that no-one wants to hear, though, is that this is an inward journey. Not an outward expression. And it takes years of progressive practice and study to reach a point where such a thing can be readily explored by an individual with ease.

This discussion began focused on the idea of performing a singular spell and having that be sufficient to effect fantastic physical change. Both premises in which this spell (and other spells like it) is built is inherently flawed and will not be accomplished as stated, to the ends desired. Declaring symptoms common in daily life does not change that. False complexity/elaborate construction does not change that. Belief does not change that. The only thing that will change that is the would-be seeker changing their perspective and effort into a direction/alternative that would be possible to achieve. This spell, does not work. There is no light-switch. It is a journey. An internal mental/emotional and spiritual exploration with no physical bearing.

Addendum; Sorry for the double-post, but these things have character limits and I feel I should quantify my experien e and practice because it is directly relevant.

I rarely bring this up as a part of conversation, unless there is good reason. However because 'belief beating reality' has been a running theme I feel my experiences and learning are uniquely qualifying (and the reason I chose to weigh-in finally to begin with.) I am a part of the Otberkin communities. Both in and also of it for over twenty-five years as a Draconic.

That means that I have spent over half of my life not only believing I am at least partly something other-than human, that belief has held firm for the entirety of those twenty-five years despite my best efforts to prove myself wrong. I am not Draconic because I want to become one. I am Draconic because I am unable to convince myself otherwise. It is a basic fact within my own mind. So intrinsic I don't really even explore it any more because it is me... that's it. Nothing fancy or special. A belief so natural that there is no convincing to be had. No change to make or strive for because it is already there. A part of me as natural and integrated as being able to look at my feet and wiggle my toes. And yet there is no effort I could ever expend that would express that Draconic nature externally in any physical way no matter how microscopic or temporary.

Where it can, and does, reflect is in the nature and Self image that occurs behind the eyes. Predispositions and attitudes. Self-imagery and visualizations used when exploring or utilizing spiritual practices. Methods and forms used in dream-work and astral journeying, healing/energy work and auras. It does not reflect in life. It reflects in how we experience it.

Dreaming big. Embracing the wisdom that comes with age, I've witnessed shifts in perspectives. While some dismiss the existence of ghosts, my focus remains unwavering on my aspirations. Regardless of belief, I persist in pursuing my dreams, relying on self-affirmation like a practiced spell. Reciting it in my mind, not on paper or phone, I sense a potent energy resonating with nature, particularly trees. It's a silent call, an energetic presence within me, offering a constant source of power. This energy holds potential for positive endeavors, even challenging the laws of physics. The journey is still unfolding, and my ultimate destination is yet to be defined.

AlphaChange wow i knew i could let you handle this, well done

AlphaChange may time be your helper, np glad i could help

Spirit76, AlphaChange So what you Are saying is that i just need the right spell, or that was what you told, cuz who knows if this is the right one. AlphaChange would you like to test my wolf spell when i had made it, mhm AlphaChange you can ask many thi gs to help me, making the spell what about the Trees, our Fairys our something elles using your candle and your stones, or what about the wolf you have on the wall. Regards supernova

4supernova I'm not sure aka idk

AplhaChange, please read over the site rules, multiple posts which could be contained to one as well as claiming the impossible is possible [it's considered roleplaying] is against site rules. Failure to adhere to the rules can result in your account being gagged

It's been explained multiple times before [not only on this spell, but elsewhere on the site] why physical transformation is not possible with real magick, what is possible with real magick, and how you can actually utilize werewolves in your craft. Werewolves are astral beings. You call on them like any other spirit in your craft. You can also use their imagery in your craft to symbolically call on their energy. You can mentally, astrally, and spiritually shift from human to other beings. Physically, it is not possible. Magick on the physical has very strict rules and structure. [this is why most of us ''non-believers'' as we've been dubbed advocate astral projection as it is possible on other planes of existence] Magick on the physical doesn't contradict nature. A human can't think ''I'm going to be a fox'' and then physically morph into a fox, but we can think about becoming a fox when we begin a meditation and mentally become a fox during the meditation. All you have to do is shift your perspective a little and you can work with werewolves in your practice [sadly, too many dig in their heels and refuse to budge despite all the evidence those who have been practicing longer have provided] as for that link, quora isn't a reputable source of information [I'd argue Wikipedia has more credibility] it can be used to speak with likeminded people, but evidence isn't UPG [unverified personal gnoses] You can use UPG, I use UPG in my craft all the time, but when it comes to educating new members on Witchcraft, and providing evidence for your claims, a forum where someone goes ''I agree with you'' isn't evidence.

https://wildhunt.org/2022/11/werewolf-magic-a-new-pagan-tradition.html

The above article is about werewolf magick if you're interested in it. You won't physically become a wolf/man hybrid, but shifting and transformation aren't physical on the physical plane. You can dress as one as you go through the spiritual process, but you won't physically go from human to animal.

Nekoshema good to see you, ig. First sorry for violating the rules of the site. However how do you know what my friend and I can do. I'm not stupid, But as for my bio, I give some information about me, And what things i done so far. For the site rules it's fine, they are here to protect us, like as the police. However ig i found a hole in our time, and yet I'm still too afraid to Even go on adventure, and try things, But ig my parentes would Be afraid, if i was missing some day. But path is a path, time works as a path and let you go. Also I don't Even know how I'm doing it, but it's like i can view to things the normal world and another world, In the outher world i saw a totem bird it was kinda cute, self if it had neon blues eyes, it was small, and it's in my room but nerver with neon blue eyes, sometimes it feels like the outher world is takling me with All it's power, Like as it calls my name, Ig that's something, I saw many things in my only 16 years and I don't Even earn my own money. Regards AlphaChange, Marry Christmas

AlphaChange wow that's a lot. Nekoshema why Are the rulles on the site like that??

Regarding the rules, I don't know why some are the way they are. Some make sense like no roleplaying [this is a site for actual witches and witchcraft can be confusing, so the less misinformation the better. As for these fake spells, unfortunately, they bring traffic to the site, which brings ad revenue, and keeps the site free] Spamming replies can make it difficult to find information. All caps, I'm not entirely sure on that one. I'd assume it's similar to no textspeak or using any language other than English [it makes replies easier to understand] Breaking any of these rules can get your account gagged by a mod without warning [and arguing with a mod on a said decision can get your new account gagged too] I personally feel bad people can log in and discover their account has been gagged without warning, so if I see a minor rule violation, I give the user a heads up [if it's something like swearing, scams or threatening members, however, instant report to keep the community safe]

@AlphaChange, you claim you and your friends can physically shapeshift [or at least it's possible] I know this isn't possible because of decades of research not only in witchcraft but werewolves [I've been a huge fan of werewolves since a kid] the lack of physical evidence, and the fact people can lie indiscriminately online, leads me to conclude what you're saying is untrue. Also, the human ego is a powerful thing [this doesn't mean you're a narcissist or anything, the ego in psychology refers to your personality. the part of you that feels special. Even if you have low self-esteem, your ego is the part of you that refuses to admit you might be awesome] so if you come to a site like this and start claiming the impossible is possible, you might gain a few ''Haters'' who point out why what your claim isn't true, but you'll also get a bunch of praise from those who want to believe. [And those of us saying why something isn't possible hurts their ego, causing them to lash out and double down] Point is, I know what is and isn't possible, and I worry those who don't will see these false claims and it does more harm to them in the long run. [But, if you still insist what you're saying is true and refuse to accept evidence to the contrary, that's your choice. I've provided information and my explanation, and since neither one of us will budge, this is where the conversation ends. I wish you all the best]
