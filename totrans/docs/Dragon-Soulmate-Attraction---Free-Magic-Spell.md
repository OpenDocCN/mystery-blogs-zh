What? Idk if something like this would be that easy. I'm pretty sure Dragons don't like to or just will not give their real names, so why would one instantly be your soulmate? I also feel like soulmate isn't the right word because for this to work that would mean everyone has a Dragon soulmate which Idk. I mean this could possibly help get a Dragon's attention but from what I know Dragons aren't very easy to build relationships with and you would still need to build a relationship with them for something like this to even come close to happen. I mean maybe if you built a relationship with a Dragon you could have one as a ''mate'' eventually...but I wouldn't count on it. Interesting idea though.

Shaderaven you are correct... But I do agree with dragonslove Remember all dragons are connected... Although they might not agree with one another the knowledge gets around of each being...each human...each spirit... And dragons have a fast, intricately connected spiritual network I speak only about what I know and comprend.... But I think he might be on to something here

I do not see this working. This might set your intention, but you will not get a dragon lover by writing ''I want one'' on some paper. Unless you already work with dragons, I also doubt this would work to connect with them at all.
