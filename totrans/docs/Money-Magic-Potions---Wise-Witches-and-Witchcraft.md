## Potions in Mundane Life

In an average year, Americans consume about 50 gallons of soda pop, 35 gallons of water, and 23 gallons of beer per capita. That’s a lot of beverages! For the modern Pagan or Wiccan each one of those drinks represents an opportunity to internalize a little extra money magick (and don’t forget to save your bottles and get back that deposit besides)!

### Prosperity Punch

*Magical Associations:* The fruits chosen for this beverage are all connected with financial prosperity
*Timing:* Thursday. Jupiter rules over everything from prosperity to finding a job
*Background:* Blackberries are ruled by the Earth element and represent abundance.

Juice of 1 cup currants
Juice of 1 cup blackberries
1 cup orange juice
2 cups apple juice
Juice of 1 cup cherries
1 tbs. honey
Several grapes (garnish)

Directions: Put all the fruit juices in a blender with the honey and whip until the blend is bubbling with energy. Remember to keep your goal in mind while the blender does its part. You might want to add an incantation while the energy is whipping up:

Drink expectantly and share it with a friend in need!

### Strawberry Settlement Frappe

*Magical Association*: This frappe is designed to help you adjust to difficulties, specifically giving you a better outlook while financial constraints exist.
*Timing:* Sunday is an overall “success” day – turn things around!
*Background:* Let the sweet cream return “sweetness” to your life.

12 cups strawberries, frozen with syrup
4 cups ice cubes
1 cup berry-flavored syrup (your choice)
5 cups sweet cream

Directions: Crush the strawberries using a blender or food processor. Follow with the ice cubes, making sure to get about the same texture for both items; this smooths your path and mingles the energies. Mix these two together in a bowl, then return it to the blender in 5 batches, adding a bit of syrup and 1 cup of cream to each batch. Blend for about 5 seconds so everything is well mixed. Serve immediately to help you keep a cool head when financial problems are taxing.

Fun Adaptations: You’ll find any frozen fruit is wonderful in this recipe. Peaches encourage wisdom so that you use money wisely, cherries help clarify your thoughts about how to make money, and raspberries restore happiness when you’re feeling frustrated.

### Lucky Windfall Breakfast Juice

*Magical Meaning*: Who doesn’t need a little luck from time to time, particularly with money. Watch for that stray bill in your pants pocket or laundry bin!
*Timing:* Spring seems filled with fortunate energy.
*Background:* Pears are still eaten in the United States during Thanksgiving for luck. Here we’re using that symbolic value to bring a lucky windfall (specifically in the way of cash) our way. Additionally, pears will help you use the money that comes from this spell wisely, spreading it out over a long time.

8 oz. pear juice
1/8 tsp. almond flavoring
Directions: Find a green cup or glass into which to pour the juice. Stir the almond flavoring clockwise into this to generate positive energy as you say:

*“Spirit of luck hear my plea
thru this juice, bring me serendipity
as within so without, as without so within
by my will this spell begins!”*

Drink to internalize the magick, then go into your day with your eyes and ears open! Don’t overlook happenstance moments: That may be opportunity knocking!

### Transforming Tea

*Magical Association:* Make this tea in order to accept the “fate” at hand, but also awaits the chance to reclaim your “ prosperity-TEA!”
*Timing:* Wednesday if you feel your financial security is blocked by bad communication. Monday if you need better intuition in using your money.
*Background:* Tea has a calming element. You need a clear mind for financial matters, so take a moment and get centered with a cup of tea.

2 bags Earl Grey tea
2 cups boiling water
3 raisins (for body-mind-spirit)
Pinch of dried pineapple
Pinch of candied orange peel, minced
Cinnamon, allspice, and sugar (to personal taste)

Directions: For luck, place all your ingredients into the pot before you add the water. Steep for about 10 minutes until the aroma is heady. As the water steeps, place your hands palm-down over the pot, visualizing the liquid being filled with vibrant green, gold, and silver light (the colors of money/prosperity). Bless the mixture before drinking it by saying:

*“Energy and confidence be mine
within and without, magick shine!
negativity bind, abundance be mine!”*

Drink 1 cup yourself and share the other with a friend in need (remember good deeds return to you three- fold!).

### Charged-Up Coffee

*Magical Associations:* We already use coffee to get our figurative motors going in the morning. This beverage is based on that idea, but adds some energetic, moneymaking herbs to the blend.
*Timing:* First thing in the morning, of course!
*Background:* Allspice, ginger and cinnamon are like the three cavaliers of money magic.

Ground coffee (enough for a full pot in your maker)
1/2 tsp. allspice
1/2 tsp. ginger
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
Directions: Mix your coffee grounds with the spices before placing them in the filter. As you put in each spice, you can add an incantation:

*“With cinnamon the spell’s begun;
with allspice I claim money and fame;
with ginger so fine, prosperity’s mine.”*

Perk to literally perk up the energy and give life to your spell!

Fun Adaptation: If you like cream in your coffee, pour about 1 tablespoonful into your cup and swirl it once. Watch what patterns appear to discern how successful your spell was. For example, if the cream moves toward the center of the cup, your luck is soon to change. If it all moves toward the top of the cup
