To perform an herbal bath ritual, simply gather the herbs that resonate with happiness and joy, such as lavender, rosemary, or yarrow. Tie them together in a muslin bag or wrap them in a piece of cloth. Hang the bag under the faucet as you fill your bath with warm water.

### Herb-Infused Oils and Candles

In addition to herbal spells and bath rituals, herb-infused oils and candles can also be used to promote happiness and joy in Wiccan practices. Creating an herb-infused oil involves combining dried herbs with a carrier oil, such as jojoba or almond oil, and letting the mixture steep for several weeks. This allows the herbs’ properties to infuse into the oil, creating a potent and aromatic blend that can be used in various ritual practices.

To use herb-infused oils for happiness, simply anoint yourself or objects with the oil before performing a happiness-focused spell or ritual. You can also use the oil to dress candles, enhancing their energy and intention. This not only adds a beautiful scent to your practice but also serves as a reminder of the positive energy you are invoking.

When incorporating herb-infused candles into your rituals, choose colors that correspond to happiness and joy, such as yellow or pink. As you light the candle, visualize the flame igniting the energy of happiness within you. Focus on your intention and allow the candle to burn down completely, releasing the energy into the universe.
