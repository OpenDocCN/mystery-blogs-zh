Venus in Capricorn can be a bit removed and serious, but there are many wonderful elements to this placement.

Typically, Venus in Capricorn folks are extremely practical. They tend to do well in the real world, as long as they don’t become *too* business-like in relationships.

As you read these descriptions of the Venus in Capricorn placement, keep in mind that the house your Venus is in makes a difference, too.

## Venus In Capricorn Characteristics

Venus rules so many areas that the characteristics of your Venus sign can have a large impact on your entire life. Here are the main ways that Venus in Capricorn shows up.

### Money and Style:

With Venus in Capricorn, you prefer classic styles over anything trendy. Older is best!

While Venus in Capricorn people can be materialistic or enjoy symbols of status sometimes, others care more about quality of items.

The typical Venus in Capricorn is known for being extremely materialistic, but I don’t feel that this is always the case. I find that a Venus in Capricorn individual is either materialistic *or* practical.

Most folks with Venus in Capricorn are really practical with possessions and money. It’s always a safe bet to let these people handle your finances. They typically don’t spend beyond their means unless other elements of the chart support this.

### Pleasure:

With Venus in Capricorn, you aren’t a party animal by any means. You may be less “fun-loving” than others.

Much of this is because you’re distrustful of others, so it’s hard for you to open up and let loose.

Another element of your serious personality is your practicality. Venus in Capricorn is all about being down-to-earth and efficient; in fact, you may even find more pleasure in hard work than in a typical party atmosphere.

You have long term goals and are grounded and realistic. Most Venus in Capricorn folks steer clear of anything flashy.

However, with Venus in Capricorn, you do have an inner child “locked up.” When you’re super comfortable around someone, your inner child comes out and you can be quite silly and playful. This happens rarely and may be surprising to people when they first see it.

### Values:

With Venus in Capricorn, you value structure and order. You believe in setting rules and then following them. You will especially value rules in the house that your Venus sits in.

Depending on the house that Venus is in, you might also value hard work. For example, with Venus in the 10th house, you value hard work and status, but with Venus in the 7th house, you value putting the work into relationships.

You probably place significance on things that sustain over time with Venus in Capricorn. You won’t go for the quick fix but instead value long term investments when it comes to money, people, your job, and more.

With materialistic items, you prefer older, quality pieces. You don’t like super trendy or new things but would rather have a historical item.

Venus in Capricorn usually means that you were born into a family with parents who adhered to a certain set of conduct rules. You were probably forced to behave a certain way, especially socially.

If you deviated as a child, you were made to feel guilty or bad. Vulnerabilities and affection were probably not priorities. Instead, you needed to follow the rules and maintain appearances.

Some families focused more on appearances while others were simply forced to follow a strict set of rules.

Now, you may still operate within this value system, however it will be important to develop your own set of values as you grow.

You won’t necessarily need to show these values to others, but it is still integral that you figure out what matters to *you.*

### Attraction:

With Venus in Capricorn, you have a very practical view of attraction. You don’t get caught up in the happy “first feelings” of love but instead see the reality of the other person.

You notice red flags quite easily when someone is flashy but has no real substance. You’re attracted to the sterner stuff that’s underneath the pomp and circumstance.

Once you’re getting to know someone, you probably value the traditional roles of courtship. You’re like to go slow and wait before jumping into a relationship.

Sometimes, you might be attracted to someone with a respectable position, a good reputation, wealth, or fame. Other folks with Venus in Capricorn are captivated by potential partners with a sense of practicality and a good work ethic.

When you’re first getting to know someone, you keep a lot of your thoughts and emotions private. You may come off as cold or removed, but you tend to attract folks who enjoy this distance or see it as flirtatious.

Others might think that you’re unfeeling because you won’t give your heart away to someone who doesn’t measure up to your criteria. You move slow and are discerning.

With Venus in Capricorn, you’re more of a doer than a talker. When you’re attracted to someone, they will know from your actions.

You have a quiet confidence or security that attracts others. You can be a bit awkward initially, but you have a cool confidence underneath. Others are attracted to this esteem in you.

### Relationships/Sex:

In a relationship, a Venus in Capricorn will be an extremely devoted mate. These folks aren’t always warm and fluffy but they will be there when you need them.

With Venus in Capricorn, you probably see relationships as a long-term investment, so you’re strict with your vetting process when you first meet someone.

Although you know that no one is perfect, you can be quite picky and will weigh the pros and cons of a potential partner carefully.

You tend to find confident partners with Venus in Capricorn. You want someone who can handle their own life; you don’t want to “save” a tragic victim.

If you do find yourself in a relationship with someone who is too needy, you will probably distance yourself slowly and grow more detached over time.

However, you certainly have a provider instinct with Venus in Capricorn. You’re steadfast and true. You find safety in practicality and all that is known.

Your reliability as a partner is attractive to others, but when you’re actually in a relationship, it takes you a long time to open up your heart.

With Venus in Capricorn, you show your emotions and your love through actions, not words. You aren’t the most flowery romantic speaker, but you will demonstrate your love over time in a relationship.

In bed, you can actually be a bit casual if you’re single and may have many partners over time, but once you commit to someone you’re loyal. You may be quite diligent about pleasing your partner and learning what they enjoy.

People with Venus in Capricorn are hard-working and practical, but they can also be cold or aloof. They adhere to a strict set of rules; this can be both a positive and a negative.

When it comes to placements in the birth chart, there are no positives without an equally difficult quality. Sometimes, the positives *are* the negatives. 

Keep in mind that no individual will have *all* of these qualities because it will depend on your specific placement (aspects, house, etc.), but many of these qualities are likely to show up in someone’s personality with Venus in Capricorn.

## Venus In Capricorn: Man vs. Woman

This part can get a little confusing, so bear with me as I explain it. Basically, Venus shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it does for someone with more feminine energy.

It’s up to you to choose with energy you identify with more. If you’re unsure, I recommend reading the description of each energy for Venus in Capricorn below and choosing what resonates with you.

Generally, in a woman or someone with feminine energy, Venus will show how the person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others.

When this person is flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Venus in Capricorn. These Capricorn qualities will show up directly in the personality.

In a man or someone with masculine energy, Venus will show what kind of qualities they are *attracted to*. How this person will *act* depends on their Mars sign, but their Venus sign dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a partner.

As we evolve and change and the gender lines blur, these distinctions become less absolute. For example, I find that *most* women will show a lot of the qualities of their Venus when they’re flirting, but a few of their Mars qualities will bleed through also.

It’s important to learn about both Venus and Mars. Each person has a unique combination of both qualities, although this combination may be swayed slightly depending on the person’s gender.

Lastly, a man who is ultra-comfortable with his sexuality will display many more of his Venus qualities, while a man who struggles with his sexuality probably won’t “own” these Venusian qualities, so he will instead look for them in a female partner.

In bed, he will probably display more of his Mars signs, but he will also have a touch of Venus. With Venus in Capricorn, this men will be practical and focused in bed. He won’t get caught up in romantic fantasies but will instead focus on the actual technique.

He may come across as unemotional, but his actions speak louder than his words. The Venus in Capricorn man wants actions instead of words from his partner, too.

## The Venus In Capricorn Man:

The Venus in Capricorn man is interested in serious and responsible women.

He won’t be attracted to anyone too emotional or talkative. He will also steer clear of superficiality or unpredictability. He likes women who are down to earth and practical.

The Venus in Capricorn man wants a pragmatic woman who focuses on work first. Sometimes, he will want someone modest and old-fashioned, while other times he will prefer someone with status or business-sense. This will depend on the house and aspects.

When the Venus in Capricorn man first meets someone, he is attracted to a strong inner energy and quiet confidence. 

Because he desires someone so practical, he is willing to be quite patient in a relationship. The Venus in Capricorn man will stick it out through the hard times; he doesn’t run away easily.

He’s likely to stay loyal in a relationship, even if the relationship turns sour. He may be a bit slow to give his heart away, but once he does, he’s all in.

Because he takes so long to commit, he can also be *really* hurt in a relationship if it falls apart. 

## The Venus In Capricorn Woman:

The Venus in Capricorn woman finds safety and comfort in what she knows. She doesn’t adapt to change quickly.

She comes across as cool, aloof, detached, or maybe even a bit snobby when she’s flirting. She isn’t fun and outgoing. Instead, her partners will be attracted to her emotionally removed vibe.

The Venus in Capricorn woman is *very* picky. She may get into relationships later in life or she might be unsatisfied with her earlier relationships. She *hates* immaturity more than anything.

In relationships, the Venus in Capricorn woman goes slow and steady. She is careful not to get hurt.

Once her defenses are down, the Venus in Capricorn woman will be warm and tender, but this may take quite a while.

She needs a lot of independence in a partnership. The Venus in Capricorn woman probably won’t be interested in partying and going out, but she does need room to have her own interests and space.

The Venus in Capricorn woman is very practical. Her idea of fun probably involves work in some way. She may have trouble keeping love interests around because of how practical and/or ambitious she is, unless her partners feel the same way.

She can be a bit old-fashioned, classy, or even a little prudish. Alternatively, sometimes the Venus in Capricorn woman is snobby and materialistic. This is less likely than the first scenario, but it is possible depending on the house and aspects to Venus.

If the Venus in Capricorn woman gets dumped, she will never show how she really feels. She is *very* good at putting on a blank face and hiding her hurt, but it can take her a long time to get over heartbreak internally.

In bed, the Venus in Capricorn woman can be a bit reserved until she feels totally comfortable. Some Venus in Capricorn women are prudes while others are less closed in actions, but are still a bit reserved, quiet, or even cold.

## How To Master The Venus In Capricorn Energy

With Venus in Capricorn, you will need to work on integrating your emotions with your rules.

Learn that it’s OK to break the social conduct code once in a while. A good place to start is by examining your childhood rules and figuring out which ones you personally like and which you want to throw out.

Develop your own internal set of rules that is created by you, not others. Make sure your own set of rules works for you.

The work for any Venus in Capricorn person will be a lot of small steps. These folks need to figure out what *they* want because they’re *so* used to being told what to do.

The goal for the Venus in Capricorn person is to let the inner child out.
