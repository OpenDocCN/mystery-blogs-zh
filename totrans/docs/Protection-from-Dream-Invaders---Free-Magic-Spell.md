Wrap 3 fresh Apple Seeds in a white cloth or white pouch. Tie the pouch/cloth closed.

Dont lose the seeds. Safety pin the pouch/cloth to the pillow you sleep on.

Sleep with the pouch/cloth attached to your pillow for seven nights. At the end of the seven nights, remove the three seeds from the pouch/cloth and toss them out your front door.
