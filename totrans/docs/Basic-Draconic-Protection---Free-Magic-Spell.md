I use a similar chant on the full moon, works well. Just note you're not calling on a Dragon to follow you everywhere, just the energies to shield you from harm [similar to calling on a deity for protection, the deity won't follow you everywhere, but they will keep an eye on you]

Oh, thanks for this clarification. I got confused for a second.

Sorry,I just started this way How to get dragon blood?

You can check this sites shop. Dragons blood can be found in most metaphysical stores, it's an oil made from the sap of a tree.

Does it have to be dragons blood? My parents don't really know about my witchcraft, and I don't know how to tell them, so I probably can't ask them to buy Dragon's Blood Oil. So I was just wondering, are there other, more common ingredients?

You can use olive oil, or just don't dress the candle at all. Hold the candle and pool energy into it, then light the candle and say the chant. I use this chant to bless my Dragon pentacle and I don't use a candle or oil, just charge it, visualize the Dragons watching over me, then I leave it either on my altar or on the windowsill to sit in the moonlight.

I have seen this spell before, so I will say it is plausible. I would edit the spell because it seems a little flimsy.
