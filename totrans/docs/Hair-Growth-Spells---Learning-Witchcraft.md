# Hair Growth Spells - Learning Witchcraft

> 来源：[https://learningwitchcraft.com/hair-growth-spells/#0001-01-01](https://learningwitchcraft.com/hair-growth-spells/#0001-01-01)

Most of us look for powerful spells to overhaul our lives. Sometimes, it is better to use some simpler spells that can have a profound effect by making marginal changes. One example is when you want to use magic to feel more confident in your appearance.

Are you trying to feel more confident about your looks? Women in particular are under a lot of pressure to look pretty. Despite making a lot of progress towards gender equality over the past 100 years, there is still a strong expectation for them to look great. They often turn to white magic to feel more attractive.

Your hair is one of the most noticeable parts of your body, so making it grow long and look nice is important. Instead of casting a complicated beauty spell, you might want to try casting a simple spell that makes your hair grow faster and appear more radiant. Here are five spells that will do just that.

## 1\. Hair Growth Spell on a Full Moon

This spell must be cast on the night of a Full Moon. It is a very simple ritual to do, but it must be done in one night with this phase of the Moon.
You will need these materials:

*   A white candle
*   Silver plate
*   Energizing infusion with red or citrus fruits
*   Scissors
*   Bag

First, you need to place yourself in a room that is permeated by the moonlight. If you don’t have such a room, you can go outside to do the ritual. However, it is important that we look for a place where you can concentrate and where nobody bothers you.

Light the white candle. This is the color of the positive energy, of the Moon, an essential color for rituals like this one. Once you have lit the white candle, place the silver plate between you and the candle.

Take the scissors and cut a small lock of your hair. A small sample will suffice to carry out the ritual. Leave it on the plate and pour the revitalizing infusion over it. Let everything mix for a few minutes. While the concoction is mixed into the infusion, visualize yourself with hair as long as you would like to have it.

After mediating a little while, take the mixture and put it in a small plastic bag. Take the bag in your left hand and bury it near your home. It will be more powerful if you bury it in the same place where you performed the ritual. It can also be in a house pot or at the base of a large tree where it won’t be disturbed.

In the next lunar cycle, you will notice that your hair is growing much faster than it was before you started the ritual.

This ritual cannot be repeated, so it is important that you do it right the first time. If not, you will have to wait seven years to try it again.

## 2\. A hair growth spell with lemon juice and rainwater

You will need these materials:

*   An egg
*   Flaxseed oil
*   Lemon juice
*   Coriander or mountain coriander
*   Glass Cup
*   Rainwater
*   White candle

You will need to do the following:

This spell must be cast on a sunny, fresh day. Start by washing your hair, without using a shampoo or conditioner. Don’t comb your hair either. Simply massage your scalp and unwind the strands of hair carefully.

Light the candle on a table and place an egg inside the glass cup. Slowly mix the flaxseed oil, small pieces of the mountain coriander and the lemon juice.

Take the concoction and massage your scalp with it, extending it to the tips of your hair. Stay close to the candle and fully cover your hair with a plastic bag. Once the candle has burnt out, wash your hair with rainwater.

Repeat this spell every three days for two weeks. You will start seeing results before the two weeks are up, but it won’t be permanent unless you complete it for this period of time.

## 3\. Spell to grow hair with yogurt and sunflower oil

You will need these materials:

*   White candle
*   Cubes of melon
*   Lock of your hair
*   Sunflower oil
*   Yogurt
*   Glass packaging
*   Matches

You will need to do the following:

As soon as night falls, take shelter in your room and try to maintain your concentration as best as possible. Light the candle with one of your matches.

Take six tablespoons of the cubes of melon and crush them next to the strand of hair inside the glass container. As you do this, recite the following incantation:

***“With your great splendor adorn my hair”.***

Add the sunflower oil and stir slowly, while saying the following:

***“Braid silvery shiny strands on my hair.”***

Take the yogurt, mix it carefully and apply it to your hair from root to tip. Cover your hair with a towel for 15 minutes. Before the candle is completely consumed, remove the mixture from your hair and whisper the following:

***“And it is done, so let it be and so let it be.”***

## 4\. Rainbow spell to make your hair more radiant

This is a spell that must be cast during a rainbow.
You will need these materials:

*   Lemon juice
*   Honey
*   Cinnamon
*   A rainbow
*   White candle

You will need to do the following:

As soon as you see a rainbow forming take the lemon juice and mix it with the honey and the cinnamon until they seem inseparable. Light the white candle and place yourself right next to it in a place where you can see the rainbow.

Take the mixture and place it on your hair while still looking at the rainbow. Caress each strand of hair as you do this.

Recite the following words:

***“Mighty nature splendor and growth grant to my hair, May the mane of the mighty lion be the guide and may the earth provide the strength and vitality to grow like a bush”.***

Massage your hair until the rainbow is finished or the candle is consumed. Then remove the mixture.

## 5\. Spell to make your hair grow with honey and river water

Honey and river water are natural ingredients that symbolize growth, so they are frequently used in hair growth spells like this one.
You will need these materials:

*   Essential oils (cinnamon, coconut or avocado)
*   Scissors
*   Lemon juice
*   Bee honey
*   River water

You will need to do the following:

Spread the essential oils on the scissors. Prepare a mixture with honey and lemon juice. After mixing them thoroughly, add a little of the river water to dilute them. With this preparation moisturize your hair and cut the ends, you can do this yourself or your trusted stylist.

As soon as you finish, wash your hair with fresh river water.
