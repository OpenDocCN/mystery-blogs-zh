 Spell for Lost Friendship

Write your full name, and your friends full name on the paper. Put the salt and rose petals on top of it. Inhale sharply, and point your index finger to the paper, while thinking of a pleasurable memory the two of you shared. Repeat the following incantation:

"I call upon thee,
O Dominio,
Aangel of friendship,
I ask you humbly to let us meet again
Give (friends name) the strength to come to me.
And rekindle our friendship
So mote it be."

Fold the paper several times and bury it at the foot of an old tree.
