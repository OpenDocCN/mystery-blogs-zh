sweet dreams of you shall come to me.
The way you laugh, the way you smile,
my heart, it skips, it leaps a mile.

Your gentle breath, your tender touch,
I long for you, so very much.
Your lips so soft, your eyes so bright,
I need you on this lonely night.
Let me feel you, smell your scent,
taste your mouth, you're heaven sent.

Close me in your warm embrace,

Pull me ever closer, near,

Fulfill my every earthly desire,
until my passion roars like fire.
As is my will, this shall be done,
my magick dream has now begun!"

Put the object under your pillow after reading the chant and then go to sleep straight away!

Question: Would this work should someone want to dream of a future love? Or does this only work for a present love?

probably present, since you can't know who your future love is going to be

Would it work for fictional characters that you like or is it just for real people
