# Love Tokens

Nature brims with objects that can be used in creative ways for magic. Plant parts, such as herbs, flowers, tree leaves, roots, fruits, and vegetables, have long been used in fashioning charms, amulets, fetishes and talismans. Stones, crystals, and man-made items like the charms on bracelets, are employed similarly.

## Is it a Charm? Is it an Amulet – Knowing the Difference

To set things in order: an amulet is a portable object which has been enchanted for protection. A charm is similar, but instead of repelling energy, it attracts. A fetish is any natural object that represents a higher influence. A talisman is a charm or amulet created at a time of astrological influences corresponding to the magic’s goal.

In love magic, charms are the most prevalent, but sometimes other magical objects are more suitable. For example, if you ‘re trying to break off a relationship or repel unwanted attention, an amulet or talisman would be better. The love tokens shared here will help you carry your magic wherever you go, inspiring love and romance every day.

## Personalizing your Talisman with Colors or Shapes

Before proceeding, two considerations will help you personalize your tokens: color and shape.

**Color**

An object’s color is an important element of its power as a love token. Choosing a base item with a specific color improves the overall effect of your personally crafted charms and amulets. Colors have a vast range of meanings. If you’d like to learn more than just this snippet, visit our sister site BuildingBeautifulSoul.com for a rainbow of Color Symbolism.

**Color Associations**

Black−establishes foundations; banishing

Blue−calms emotions, peace with self and others

Green−encourages wholeness in a relationship or with self; fertility and luck

Orange−increases personal expressiveness; insight, self-worth, and positive outcomes

Pink−augments attraction; friendship, healing, gentle love, and self-love

Purple−decreases frustration; spiritual love and commitment

Red−enhances sexual enjoyment; assertive and protective love

Yellow−improves community spirit; thoughtful awareness

White−purifies (especially intentions); protective energy

**Shape**

Certain shapes make us think of specific subjects right away, such as a heart for love. Ancient mages gave metaphysical correspondences to many shapes that made their way into every day magical traditions. For example, the circle is considered an integral part of creating sacred space. It also represents wholeness and Earth energies.

**Shape Associations**

Arrowhead−hitting one’s mark; Cupid’s arrow

Circle−female fertility; the intimate circles of our lives

Cross, equal-armed−equality and symmetry

Egg−fertility and creativity; new beginnings and healing emotional dis-ease

Heart−energizing all types of love magic

Oblong−male fertility and potency; directing energy (especially if an obelisk)

Square−stability; putting down roots

Star−fulfilling wishes; expanding one’s horizons

Triangle−protective energy, especially for one’s home and family

Using this information, you could look for a purple, triangular object to safeguard your home and generate spiritual love among family members. Or you could give a round, pink quartz to someone, honoring their friendship.

In all instances, the objects should be cleansed before becoming part of your magical efforts. Wash them in salt water, move them through the smoke of a cleansing incense like cedar or pine, or visualize white light pouring into them. This ensures an open vessel that absorbs and transmits your magical energy without any residual “goo”.

# Seeking Love

Seeking love usually requires that you get out and meet people. This makes portable magical tokens terrific aids in your quest. They create a magical aura around you that communicates your goal to a prospective companion.

## Charismatic Aromatic

Scented oils communicate a world of meaning without words. Using one of your own favorite recipes, prepare a special attraction oil. Pour a little into a small, unbreakable container with three tiny, pink quartz crystals and a small magnet (like those used for refrigerator magnets).

When you go out, dab a little on your pulse points and over your heart, saying:

*“Come to me, or me to thee.
By these words, the magic is freed!”*

Keep your eyes open, your instincts alert, and see what happens.

## Breaking the Ice Charm

The first few minutes of conversation between strangers are usually the hardest. This charm helpS you communicate more effectively. Take a large bay leaf and visualize it being filled with golden light. At the same time, use your fingertip to write the word “eloquence” on the leaf, saying:

*“Apollo, god of speech and honesty, bring to me the words I need,
fill them with confidence, truth, and energy.”*

Put the bay leaf in your shoe, pocket, or wallet before leaving the house. If the evening is successful, burn the leaf later, thanking Apollo for his assistance.

## Flirtation Fetish

Flirting is part of the dating game. This fetish will make you feel more at ease and frolicsome. Find a small image of a cat. It can be a photograph or drawing, a carved small stone or metal figurine. You will also need some dried catnip or valerian, and a white candle.

If possible, create this fetish during the month of April or May, invokinf the Goddess Bast during her traditional festival times. Place the image in a circle formed from the herbs, with the white candle behind it. Just before sunset on the night you plan to go out, light the candle, saying:
 *“Goddess of pleasure and fun,
give me assurance and convincing words
before the setting sun.
By the lighting of this candle, my spell is begun.”*

Leave the candle to burn safely, and take the image with you to keep Bast’s blessing nearby. When you return home, put the image back in its place and leave it there until needed again.

## Meeting Potential Friends

An old treatise on amulets says the image of a frog on a beryl stone draws friends to you. If you can’t find Beryl, buy or locate a rock large enough ando paint a frog’s image on it. Cleanse the rock overnight in salt water first. Take the stone with the frog image outside when the sun is shining. Imagine the warmth and light of the sun being absorbed by the stone and say:

*“Friendship is true, friendship is kind,
Friends this stone will help me to find
In the dark, in the light, in or out of my sight,
byt he word ‘frog” and my will,
the magic takes flight!”*

Wrap it in a yellow cloth (the color of friendship). Take it with you to places where you might meet new friends, such as coffee shops, art galleries, or the zoo. When you are ready, gently touch the stone and whisper the command word ‘‘frog.’’ See how many princes and/or princesses show up!

## Meeting Potential Mates

An old English tradition instructs that one should place an even-pointed ash leaf, white heather, or a two-leaf clover in the left shoe. Each of these draws love to you. The next person you meet will bear an initial of a future mate. To further empower this token, add an incantation such as:

*“Luck walks with me; love shall I see.
Let my true love come quickly to me.”*

After you meet that special someone, remove the token and either preserve it (to safeguard your relationship) or ritually dispose of it with thankfulness.

## Glamoury Talisman

This talisman increases your aura of personal attractiveness. It also improves your ability to give and receive love. You will need a piece of amber that is easily held in your hand. Leave the amber in the light of a full moon for three nights. Each night, put your hands over the stone visualizing the silver light of the moon being absorbed by it and say:

*“Lady moon, fill this stone with your silvery beams.
Whenever it’s placed against my body,
let me glow with that same light from within.”*

Each time you want to release the magic housed in the stone, rub the amber on your hand or leg while visualizing silver light pouring into your aura. This will create static to spark the magic.

## Carving Out Your Wish

Use a small handful of clay, rose water, and a toothpick. Place three drops of rose water on the clay, saying:

*“With one, the spells begun.
With two, this charm is true.
With time and the count of three, bring love to me.”*

Shape the clay into a heart, and carve the word “love” on it with the toothpick. After the heart dries, carry it with you until your wish manifests.

# Deepening Love

Tucking a little extra magic in your pocket will make moments spent with a companion all the more memorable. These love tokens enhance quality time and encourage stronger unity.

## Commitment Charm

Commitment is really a two-way street, so it’s best to make two of these charms, one for each of you.
For two charms you will need three tablespoons of dried orange peel, three sticks of cinnamon, and a sprinkling of cumin. You will also need the petals from two roses, two small woven baskets with tops (these represent two lives “woven “together), and two small pieces of jade.

Mix the orange peel with the cumin, then place half in each basket around the outer edge. Put the rose petals in the middle of the orange peel circle (or rectangle). Break the cinnamon sticks in half, and fashion triangles from them on top of the rose petals. Then gently put the jade in the center of love’s “nest.” Bless the containers together, saying:

*“Within this basket woven round
love and devotion, securely bound.
When e’er we carry this stone of jade,
on each other our hearts shall be staid.”*

You, your partner, or both of you should remove and carry the jade when your relationship needs some magical bolstering.

## Communication Talisman

Find any small, flat, plain rock and some yellow paint or an indelible yellow marker. When the moon is in Aries, paint the rock with the words “speak” and “listen.” Carry this with you, making your interactive skills more effective. Hold it for a few moments before going into the situation, visualizing the words as yellow light pouring from your mouth. Touch the stone again, reactivating the energy each time you feel yourself fumbling for words.

## Attraction Fetish

You will need a turquoise stone, a small length of silver wire and orange water. Wrap the stone with the silver, saying:

*“Cupid, take up your how and arrow,
aim toward this stone; let your mark sure be.
Fill it with love to bring _______
closer to me.”*

Fill in the blank with the name of your significant other. Put it in his or her pocket. Afterward, bathe in orange water daily for eight days. If the relationship is meant to deepen, it will show signs by the end of this time.

## Pledge Charm

When you and your partner are ready for a deeper commitment, make this charm for each other. Begin with a long strand of white cloth (symbolizing pure intentions) and two equal-sized clippings from a piece of old clothing from each of you. Braid these together, tying the braid at the end.

Take some copper wire (to conduct your energy) and snip off several 4 to 5-inch pieces. Wrap them at equally spaced junctures where all three strands meet on the braid. At each juncture, take turns making one wish for your future together. When this is finished, cut the braid in half so each person can carry one piece. Reunite these two halves at your wedding or handfasting, then store it in a safe place to ensure continued commitment.

## Marriage Charm

Take the rings you intend for exchanging at the ritual. Hold them and chant:

*“Passionate bliss,
faith and happiness,
love and peace,
let the magic never cease.”*

Continue this chant until the candle melts almost to the point of the rings.

# Maintaining Love

No matter where we go, loved ones stay in our hearts and minds. Why not bring our magic with us, keeping these relationships strong and fulfilling? These portable tokens will send warm, refreshing energy to those you love, no matter where you go.

## Aphrodisiac Fetish

Just before a special meeting with your significant other, place a red rose and a red carnation somewhere on your body. Empower these saying:

*“Aphrodite, Goddess of Delight,
Within these petals place your power,
bring passion and enchantment this very hour.”*

Touch the petals just before seeing your loved one, and repeat the phrase to spark some extra excitement. Dry the petals and keep them as part of an aphrodisiac medicine bag or for burning in incense.

## Faithfulness Talisman

An old English spell calls for picking a sprig of knot grass and tying it at the center. Place this close to your heart, saying:
 *“Devotion tied within, let the magic now begin.
_______ kept near my heart,
close to me remain, never to part.”*

Fill in the blank with the name of your partner. As long as the grass remains tied, devotion’s secured.

## Anti-fascination Amulet

When you feel weakened by the temptations of someone other than your steady, this amulet provides extra willpower. You will need a small carnelian and a scrap of aluminum foil. If possible, create the amulet during a waning moon, so your undesired interest wanes with it.

Take the carnelian in hand and visualize on its surface the face of the person who has been distracting you, until the image is very clear. Wrap the stone with the aluminum, saying:

*“Reflect away, turn my attention back home.
Let my heart not stray, let my eye never roam.”*

Carry this token with you when you feel your resolve weakening.

## Mystery Glamoury

Mystery and intrigue helps keep interest alive in a relationship. The formula for this type of glamoury depends on whether you want to inspire a man or a woman. For a man, use jasmine or lavender oil. For a woman, use musk oil. Put the oil in a portable vial with a clear quartz point to increase its energy. Leave this in sunlight for three hours for attracting a man, moonlight for attracting a woman.

Carry the vial when you and your partner have a special date planned. Dab on a little before seeing him or her, saying:

*“Magical mystery, empower this glamoury.*

To my aura impart a secret art

to please and to tease _______’s heart.”

Fill in the blank with the name of your partner.

## Negativity Clearing Amulet

When stress and anxiety begin to interfere with the peacefulness of your relationship, try this amulet. Find a jet stone that’s easily held in the palm of your hand. Set it under the light of a waning moon for three nights, saying:

*“Tension taken away, negativity drained away,
external influences kept at bay.”*

Carry this stone with you for three days, so it absorbs all pressures and burdens. On the last day, take it with you in a hot bath. Visualize any remaining tension going down the drain with the water. Be sure to cleanse the stone in salt water afterward if you plan to use it for other purposes.

## Banishing Jealousy

When you find yourself becoming possessive of your mate or their time, make this talisman. Find any green stone, a carnelian, and an amethyst, along with a small pouch. Place the stones into the pouch during a dark moon, one at a time, saying:

*“Carnelian decreases jealousy.
Amethyst keeps self-control with me.
This stone of green draws selfishness away.”*

Any time your possessive behavior interferes with your relationship, take out one stone and throw it as far as possible, sending those feelings with it. When you need to replace a stone, repeat the incantation to energize the new one.

## Long-Lasting Love Charm

An ancient spell advocates placing three pinches of sand, a feather, and three ground peanuts into a clay pot. Cover this mixture with boiling water and keep it at a slow-rolling boil until the water evaporates (this gently “warms” and energizes). As it boils, strongly visualize your desires in the steam and chant:

*“Love long as all days,
long as all nights.
Love as lasting as my soul,
let my magic take to flight.”*

Continue the chant, allowing the volume to grow or diminish as inspiration dictates. Carry the remnants from the pan in a red sachet as a love charm.

# Letting Go

When things go wrong in a relationship, our sadness, confusion, and other negative feelings affect everyone around us. Symbolic tokens of release help decrease that effect and assist us in starting the healing process through positive action.

## Reigning in Lust

When you need to keep physical desires under control for closure, use this talisman.

Find a portable item that has a yin-yang symbol on it, such as a ring, earring, or tie tack. Or paint one out of gold and silver on a small white cloth. During a waning or dark moon, cup the token in your hands, saying,

*“Dainichi, god of wisdom,
place within this token the sagacity and self-control,
to know and do what is truly best.
Keep my will and intention balanced and sure.
So be it.”*

Carry this with you whenever you cross temptation’s path.

## Turning Away Unwanted Attention

When simply saying “no” isn’t enough for a suitor, make this banishing amulet. Write the name of the person backward on a piece of paper. Cut this into seven equal-sized pieces and dab in clove oil. Burn one piece each night for seven nights during a waning moon. As each piece of paper burns, whisper to the smoke:

*“Not to harm, but to heal.
Turn your heart and mind away.
Find another.”*

Mix the ashes with bloodstone or onyx, and carry until the problem resolves. At that point, ritually dispose of the ashes in running water, in a fire, or by burial.

## Breaking It Off

One of the best amulets for ending a relationship is a blessed, charged piece of fluorite. Besides helping you both to see your situation clearly, the natural 3-D diamond shape of this stone provides a firm foundation on which to base your parting words.

To charge the fluorite, leave it in sunlight for seven minutes (for a conscious, logical decision) and in moonlight for seven minutes (for sensitivity). Carry this with you, touching it momentarily before delivering the bad news. Afterward, you may want to throw the stone away to detach yourself further from the relationship and its energy.

## Healing a Broken Heart

When it seems as if your emotional wounds will never heal, make this token. Take a small, clear amethyst (for self-control), socialite (for emotional balance), and a carnelian (to decrease anger), and put them in a glass of spring water. Visualize purple, blue-white, and reddish light, respectively, emanating from the stones and filling the water. Take the glass in hand, saying:

*“The purple ray to bring balance,
the blue-white ray to protect and bring peace,
the red ray, so anger can cease.”*

Drink the water, then carry the stones with you until you start feeling like your old self again. At that point, you can either ritually dispose of them or purify them for later use.

## Forgiveness

One of the most difficult parts of the separation and healing process is forgiveness. Try a talisman made from a clear quartz (to clear energy) and jet (to collect excess negativity). Place the stones in a pouch filled with mint (to inspire peace), along with any object that represents the person you wish to forgive. As you place the token in the pouch, say:

*“Wrapped ‘round by peace and good intention,*

where anger is stilled, emotions calm,

let this token be a healing balm.”

Carry this with you until you feel forgiveness for that person. Then release the herbs and token to the earth (if biodegradable) and cleanse the stones for other applications.

## Forgiveness #2

Truth be told you may feel mad at yourself for the failure of a relationship. Create this amulet and hold it close, deterring those thoughts. Find a small item with a reflective surface (mirror-like). Empower it saying,

*“I cannot see the ME in me*

Reflect the truth, and let it be

In my heart, the anger bind

Bring forgiveness to my aching mind.”
