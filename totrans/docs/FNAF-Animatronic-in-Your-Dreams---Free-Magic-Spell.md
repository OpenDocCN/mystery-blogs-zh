 1\. Draw what you want to look like as an animatronic. Don't copy other characters' colors. Make yourself child-appropriate unless you are in FNAF 3 or 4, make yourself as scary-looking as possible.

2\. Eat bananas. They will help you imagine your FNAF setting. (Science, people.)

3\. Play the game and know the other animatronics and security Guard's places. This is important or you will not be able to kill the guard.
Or know what it looks like in the daytime.

4\. Imagine yourself as your animatronic through the day and when you go to bed imagine you are in your location. It will be easier to get dreams!
Wanna meet your friend? get him/her to join in too and pretend to be a robot too!

5\. Keep doing this even if it takes a while to get a dream.

Are there any spells to call them into the human world

No, that is not how Real Magik works. FNAF is a work of fiction, Magik does not defy nature, ergo you cannot bring a fictional being into the physical world.

Eating food that can affect your dreams and playing the game right before bed can indeed cause you to dream about it. I would not call it a spell exactly, but if you are focused on the intention to dream about FNAF, fine, it is a spell.
