**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Rose petals from a living, wild rose

 As you are plucking the petals, visualize someone who has all the qualities you think are necessary in the ideal partner - humor, generosity, compassion, whatever. Take the petals to a stream or river, hold them in cupped hands, and, again visualizing the qualities you are looking for, let them drop into the water, saying:

As this bloom is taken downstream

May I find the love of which I dream

And let it be done, that it harm no one.

The spell is cast.
