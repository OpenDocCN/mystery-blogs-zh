# Bind a Person Away From You

A safe spell to make a person leave your life forever.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Bind a Person Away From You'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A small square piece of paper

*   Purple yarn

*   White or black yarn

*   Black Ink pen

*   Purple ink pen

*   Person's name

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A small square piece of paper

*   Purple yarn

*   White or black yarn

*   Black Ink pen

*   Purple ink pen

*   Person's name

 First, draw a purple pentacle on the piece of paper. Then, write the person's full name in black in the center of the pentacle. If you like, you can draw any religious symbols on the paper as you wish. Then, take the bottom right corner of the paper and fold it up to the upper left corner. You should get a triangle. Fold this in half to get a smaller triangle. Fold this small triangle in half one more time.

Now, take your purple and white string and tie it up, saying, "I bind you, (person's name), with purple, black, and white, please o please, just leave my life. Leave me now, make my life better, make your life better, forever and ever." Take the paper and hold it to your third eye, saying, "To be protected from you, this magick charm I shall do. I bind thee away from me, please o please just protect me. To be protected from your harm, I herby now cast out this charm." Say this three to nine times.

Now, place it on the ground and stomp on it with your right foot nine times. You can now bury it, burn it, or keep it with you or on your altar. I recomend doing all three for maximum effects. While burning or burying it, visualize them leaving your life forever, while chanting, "(Person's name), please leave my life, enhance both our lives more than ever before. So mote it be." Then they should be gone within a week or so. Both of your lives should benefit to them leaving, and nobody gets hurt!

''You can now bury it, burn it, or keep it with you or on your altar. I recomend doing all three'' does that mean i need to make three copies of paper into triangles?

It either means the authors suggesting picking one of the three as they are the best options, or leave it on the altar for a time, then burn it and bury the ashes.

@nekoshema I did all 3 like you suggested. Did the burning and burying about 2 weeks ago. So far I haven't heard from him not once. I realised I made one error though. The instructions said to write the name in black, I did it in purple like everything else. That won't be a problem right?

Nope. Purple can be substituted for black, same with a dark blue. You'll be fine.

Does it have to be yarn? If I coukd find sewing string, would that work?

What if I don't know the person's name? They are an anonymous stalker.

Can i just do this to my mum-
