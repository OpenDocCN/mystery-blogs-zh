How to write mermaid spells: write a spell that incorporates water elements and calls on mermaids. You can write any type of working spell in this way, you cannot, however, become a mermaid. Look into Sea Witchcraft.

yeh right, like everyone has there own beliefs,

... They do. What is your point exactly? People who actually work with mermaids practice sea witchcraft, they call on astral mermaid energy similar to someone working with Fae or dragons. You can build your own unique path around them, but you cannot become one. That is where reality meets fantasy.
