You can not become anything but human. You were born a human and human you shall remain. No amount of wishes will ever change that fact.

What kind of side affects?

This is a spell based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. Elves of Rivendell are not a real thing, and regardless, you cannot change your species or race with magick. You are human and always will be, any side effects you may feel from a spell like this would merely be placebo.
