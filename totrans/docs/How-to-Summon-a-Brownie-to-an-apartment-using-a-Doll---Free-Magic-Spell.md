# How to Summon a Brownie to an apartment using a Doll

This spell uses a self-made doll to summon a brownie to take care of your apartment.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'How to Summon a Brownie to an apartment using a Doll'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A Wooden Cradle built by the owner (you can just cut a small hole in the log)

*   Dry grass

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A self-made doll (it is better to use rags from old but clean clothes of the inhabitants of the apartment as a material)

*   A Wooden Cradle built by the owner (you can just cut a small hole in the log)

*   Dry grass

 Warning: This Method of summoning a Brownie is quite laborious, but correct.  It is preferable to start taunting a Brownie during the full moon, but this condition is advisory in nature.

1\.  You need to find a quiet place in the apartment, put the cradle there and the doll there.  The bottom of the bed should be covered with dry grass. Once you've done this say:

"A brownie-brownie, a small child is waiting for you, does not want to sleep without you, sheds bitter tears, tosses and turns in the cradle, stretches with its arms.  Come to us, brownie-brownie, look after the baby and our apartment, and we will feed and water you for that, we will give you gifts."

The Conspiracy should be read every morning and evening until a new brownie gives a sign that he has come.  Usually, the spirit immediately starts its immediate duties, making noises and moving things in the process of work.  The doll CANNOT be touched, since it is under the care of the brownie.  Before moving it anywhere, say: 

"We do it for good, we don't do harm."

I have no idea what you're talking about but as a baker you cannot knit a doll for it to bring brownies to you that's stupid all you have to do is buy some brownie mix and make some brownies yourself

This spell is talking about a type of spiritual being, not the food.

Brownies (broonie, brunaidh or gruagach) are Scottish house fairys that clean and watch over your home in exchange for a bowl of milk or cream. They are known to pull pranks, be easily offended, and will leave if you gift them new clothes.

I have my doubts this actually works. You make your space friendly to fairys and Brownies usually appear. I have only heard of ways to repel Brownies, not summon them. From personal experience, they will find their way to you if your home has the right energy.
