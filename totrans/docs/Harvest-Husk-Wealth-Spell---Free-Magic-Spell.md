# Harvest Husk Wealth Spell

This is an easy money spell, but it will be more powerful if you can perform it in the fall when corn is in season. If not, any other time will be fine

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Harvest Husk Wealth Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   One full leaf of dried corn husk

*    A dollar bill

*    A piece of green ribbon or yarn

*    Patchouli oil

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   One full leaf of dried corn husk

*    A dollar bill

*    A piece of green ribbon or yarn

*    Patchouli oil

Flatten out the husk leaf and rub patchouli oil along the inside surface. As you work in the oil, repeat the following words:

With the power of harvest corn,
Bring me money, dusk till morn
Harvest wealth
Financial health
And now success is born.

Lay the dollar on the husk, and roll the two together into a tight tube. Tie it closed with the green ribbon, leaving a little extra ribbon for hanging. Hang it above a main door in your home (it doesn't have to actually dangle into the doorway) and wealth will soon follow.
