 Carve their name in the top of the candle,
write their name, what they did, and your intent on the paper. Charge it with your anger, call upon the energies of the tarot card, and the crystals to assist you. Think about your intent and light the candle after annointing it with chaos water. Light the paper on fire with the candle and burn it safely in a cauldron or small metal dish of your choosing (an altoids tin works if you fold the paper up) 
Collect the ash and add it to the chaos water for later use, burn the candle and think about your intent until the name in the top of the candle melts. 
Cleanse your space and yourself.
Your spell is complete.
