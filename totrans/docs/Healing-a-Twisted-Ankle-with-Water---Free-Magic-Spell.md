# Healing a Twisted Ankle with Water

  Rated 5/5 Stars

I've use it multiple times, my cousin is the one who showed it to me when I twisted my ankle very painfully.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Healing a Twisted Ankle with Water'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Dip your hands/fingers in the water and starting below the knee, lightly run your fingers down the leg to the ankle while also letting the water drip down.

Visualize the water droplets soaking up the pain and taking the pain away as it runs down off the leg. Have whoever you're doing this for visualize it as well.

Do this for a few minutes, until you both feel it has worked and the person with the twisted ankle feels no more pain. (It's taken me no more than a minute at most to perform this spell)

Dry the leg off by patting gently with the towel and carefully put weight back on the leg. If it doesn't hurt then it worked.

This is not exactly a mermaid spell, but you could make a chant asking a mermaid to help you heal to make it one. In its own, it is a very simple healing spell.
