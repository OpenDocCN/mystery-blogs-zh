# The Philosophy and Practices of an Earth Witch - Wise Witches and Witchcraft

> “Treat the Earth well: it was not given to you by your parents, it was loaned to you by your children. We do not inherit the Earth from our Ancestors, we borrow it from our Children. We are more than the sum of our knowledge, we are the products of our imagination.”
> **– Ancient Proverb**

There are two ways of thinking about the Earth Witch’s practices. First is the magick that she enacts specifically for the planet to facilitate its ongoing wellbeing. The second is magick that’s centered around natural objects. This article addresses the former — ideas about those spells, rituals, and other spiritual methods we devise specifically for [**Gaia**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witches-garden/goddess-gardens-gaia-earth-garden/).

## When you Mess up Clean Up

While most people would never think of just randomly tossing their trash on a friend’s lawn, for hundreds of years that’s pretty much what humankind has been doing to the earth. At some point we stopped thinking of the Earth as sacred and began treating it as our domain, not seeing the long-term effects of such neglect until recently. Nonetheless it seems that some of our wise ancestors left us clues as to how we should think about and treat the earth both substantively and spiritually. The Earth Witch or [**Green Witch**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/wicca-wiccan/types-of-wicca-green-wicca/) uses those concepts as a starting point for the way in which he not only weaves magic but also the way in which he lives.

**Earth-Minded Philosophy**

As early as the third century, the Greek philosopher Porphyry spoke about the trees having souls. Saint Anthony told us that nature was God’s “open book” and Saint Francis basically became the patron of ecologists through his ardent love and care for wildlife. It was he who spoke of Mother Earth as nourishing humans (and we suspect he meant more than our bodies!). And these people are not alone. Numerous well-respected figures, from Jesuit priests and European alchemists to nineteenth-century writers and artists like Henry David Thoreau, were trying to define this great gift. It just took us a while to really see and hear their messages.

**Protecting the Earth Legally & Religiously**

[wisew_rectangle_large align=”left”]In 1982 the United Nations created a special charter that lays out ways of safeguarding the environment. In 1983 and 1987, the religious sector followed suit when the World Council of Churches focused on creation’s integrity, and Pope John Paul told Catholics everywhere that human “dominion” over the Earth was not absolute and that we must use this treasure wisely. Sadly, even after the turn of the millennium, we find some of that focus blurred behind other social issues. As spiritual beings, however, we still need sound ethical standards for how we treat this world. Our children deserve a whole Earth, not whatever remnants we choose to leave behind.

**Activism**

While not everyone is a political activist, there are many small ways you can fight for our planet. Watch for companies who abuse her resources and boycott their products (hitting the pocketbook is often very successful). Also watch for those political figures who support ecological necessities like finding an alternative, clean fuel sources and vote for them. Beyond these kinds of things, don’t forget about the power in a Witch’s kit! Create spells, rituals, charms, and meditations that direct their energy back to she who sustains us all: The Earth.

## Earth Healing Magical Visualization, Charm, Spell, & Prayer

Speaking of creating magical energy for the Earth, here are some examples that you can try as they are or adapt them for more personal meaning:

**Pre-bed Visualization for Earth Healing**

If you are looking for a relatively easy way for directing energy toward Earth’s Healing this short bedtime [**visualization**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/prayers-meditations-visualizations/meditation-visualization-witchcraft-paganism-magic/) is a great starting point. As you close your eyes bring the image of the earth as it appears from space. Bath that sphere in blue-white light. The light should flicker with magical energy as it moves into the atmosphere cleaning up toxins in every corner of creation. There is inherent, simple beauty in this visualization. For one thing, it helps you really think of the planet as a wholly-connected living organism. It also acts as a medium through which you can direct positive spiritual energy. Last, it’s a pretty nice image to take with you into your [**dreams**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witch/dream-interpretation-for-wiccans-witches-and-pagans/).

**Earth Healing Seed Charm**

Component: Wildflower Seeds, Green Pouch
Timing: Full Moon, Thursday or Sunday

Let your seeds charge in the light of the sun at dawn (for a new beginning). Bundle them into your pouch saying:

*As these seeds to the winds
Let the healing magic begin.*

Carry the pouch with you and when you pass a spot in obvious need of healing, toss a few seeds repeating your incantation. Refill your pouch whenever it’s empty. [wisew_rectangle_large align=”right”]

**Earth Healing Spell**

This spell can easily become a mini-ritual just by calling in the Quarters for Sacred Space and potentially inviting a God or Goddess with strong Earth energies for aid.

Components: Clear quartz, Honey or Mead, a Shovel
Timing: Waxing Moon, Thursday or Saturday

Begin by charging the crystal in moonlight for four hours and sunlight for four hours. Four is the number associated with the Earth Element.

Take the stone somewhere that you consider sacred. You know that hush that falls over everything when the life-energy around you is truly Holy? That is the type of location to seek out.

Dig a hole in the earth large enough to house the crystal. Pour a dollop of honey or mead therein. This acts as an offering as well as a spell component since honey is very healthy and part of many folk remedials and healing spells.
Whisper an incantation into the stone. You can really say whatever you wish for protecting and renewing the land. Here’s one example:

*Let us never take more than we give.
Let us never destroy when we can create
Let there never be ugliness, let our hearts inspire beauty
Replace debris with purity
Replace misuse with restoration
Replace greed with replenishment
Let the Earth renew today and every day
So be it.*

As you recite the incantation envision the same vibrant white light filling the crystal as you imagined in your visualization. Gently tuck the crystal into the hole and cover it up. You can come back here any time and extend energy into the quartz so that it stays fresh and charged. You can also work rituals here or spend time in meditation.

**Earth Prayer**
While there are any number of prayers that you could use in your magical working, this one by
KiiskeeN’tum seems very suited to the goal of working closely with the Earth:

*Mother Earth hear your child, As I sit here on your lap of grass, I listen to the echoes of your voice In my brother, the Wind, As he blows from all corners and directions.
The soft and gentle raindrops are the Tears you cry for your children.*

Teach me the Lessons you offer: To nurture my children, as you nurture yours, To learn the Lessons of the Four Kingdoms, that make up this World of Physical Things, and To Learn to Walk the Path chosen so long ago.

Mother Earth, hear your child, Be a bond between the Worlds of Earth and Spirit. Let the Winds echo the Knowledge of the Grand-fathers.

Who await, unseen, yet visible if I only turn my eyes to their World.

Let me hear their Voices, in the Winds that Blow to the East.

From the East: I seek the Lessons of Childhood: To see with the trusting innocence of a small one, The Lessons of Spirit, Given in Love by our Creator.

From the South: to Learn the Ways of Questioning: The Fire and Independence of adolescence, The Truths, and how they help us Grow along this Path.

[wisew_rectangle_large align=”left”]From the West: where the Grand-fathers teach us Acceptance of Responsibility That come during the years of Marriage and Family.

That my own children grow Strong and True.

From the North: where the Elders, who by their long lives Have learned and stored Wisdom and Knowledge. And Learned to Walk in Balance and Harmony with our Mother, the Earth.

Mother Earth, hear your child. Hold my hand as I Walk my Path in this World. Guide me to the Lessons I seek, bring me closer to Our Creator, Until I return to the Western Direction, to once again Enter the World of Spirit, Where the Sacred Fire Awaits, and I re-join the Council of the Elders, In the Presence of the One Who-Created-All.

**Earth Gods and Goddesses**

Cultures around the world have stories of Divine Beings who rule over the Earth. You can certainly call on one of these Beings to whom you relate for extra support in your Earth spells and prayers. These include:

Bon Dea
Ceres
Cerunnos
Dagda
Fauna
Pan
Rhea

## Food for Thought:

In closing we’d like to share a few thoughts that may inspire ideas for your personal Earth healing approaches:

*   You cannot touch a blade of grass without affecting a star.
*   The same water that fell on Moses is still part of our water system today.
*   As you breathe right now, the molecules of air that everyone in the world has also taken into their vital systems within the last two weeks is part of that breath.
*   You must love something to make it whole. How much do we each love our world?

You need not be an Earth Witch to look at the world in which we live differently. Our world is a living, breathing entity worthy of respect. The more you treat the land as sacred, the more you build positive vibrations for the planet. One person, one moment at a time can make all the difference in… well… the World!
