This prayer is said to ask for her blessing.

Chant the following:

''Oh Great Spirit,
whose voice I hear in the winds,
and whose breath gives life to all the world,
hear me!

I come before you, one of your children,
I am small and weak.
I seek your strength and wisdom.
Let me walk in beauty and make my eyes ever
behold the red and purple sunset.

Make my hands respect the things you have made,
my ears sharp to hear your voice.
Make me wise, so that I may know the things
you have taught my People,
the lesson you have hidden in every leaf and rock.

I seek strength not to be superior to my brothers,
but to be able to fight my greatest enemy, myself.
Make me ever ready to come to you,
with clean hands and straight eyes,
so when life fades as a fading sunset,
my spirit may come to you without shame.''
