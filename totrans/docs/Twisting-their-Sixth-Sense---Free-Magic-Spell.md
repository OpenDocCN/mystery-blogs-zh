**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Concentration

*   An enchanted object(optional)

Hold your enchanted object in the palm of your left hand and empty your mind, visualizing only the person you wish to target.
Chant the following:

'Shadow spirits, come to me
Plague this person that I see
Watch them always, day and night
Don't release them from their plight
Make them feel your icy stare
Even if there's no one there'

This should be chanted at least 3 times.

NB: This spell will only last for about a week, so I have not included a reversal spell.

karma is right around the corner for those who use the gods for evil

Not everyone believes in a karmic system, nor do all witches work with or believe in deity.

well you're not wrong...regardless of what one believes in

What if you are using it for a good purpose?

Will it work I just cast it on a kid in my class

I believe this spell will work though never mind

Does this spell work?

I think it will. Some of these comments do agree in it's success, though I've learned not to trust other comments too much. I haven't tried it myself, so I wouldn't personally know.

Not sure exactly how this works. Perhaps it creates a servitor or egregore which follows the person? It might work well on people with good psychic skills or abilities. As for normal people, most ''normals'' usually have some kind of ability or psychic skill. So it should work for them, but not at the same strength as psychics.

I heard a few echoes of my voice, or possibly mimicking, as I chanted. Does this mean anything?

This requires an edit, but sounds plausible. This appears to be a jinx, not a sixth sense ability. Since you are directing this on someone, the object should either belong to them, or be a photo of them. Focus your intention on them, imagine exactly what you want to happen as clearly as possible. The chant should be repeated more than three times. Chants build energy. The more you chant, the stronger the spell.

If you hear voices in your head, and you are not clairaudient, this would indicate you are not directing the energy on your target. If your object is reflective, that would send the energy back. The other option could be, you accidentally summoned something. This chant calls on *shadow spirits*. If you do not work with spirits, or do not specify the spirit, you are open the door for anything to visit. If you do not have your protections up, the spirit might walk in and decide to target you instead because they do not work with you and you let them in. The other option could be you conjured a shadow person. That is very dangerous. A shadow person is a spiritual being who feeds on misfortune. They look like a shadow of a person that walks along your walls. Have your protections in place before trying this spell.

Thank you so much! That was very helpful. I think I may be clairaudient, however, so that's better than the other outcomes. But, it still feels like I did plenty of black magic on a certain group of people who have been harassing me, and it seems it's just backfired. I may just be new, but that slightly worries me...
