 Discord and unturned chaos turn,
Thou beautiful one adorned in the serpent consumed skin,
Who by slaying commanding the essence therein I call thee forth.Angel of the Bottomless Pit,
Never deformed yet terrible in appearance Armed with arrows dread;far striking,
Bakkhion,twofold and divine,power far diffused,and course oblique is thine.
In one hand stands forth the Golden Sword of Vengeance
in the other the Silver-Bow of plague and death.
Open the pit and send forth pestilence,let thy locusts consume

I curse thee.......in the name of Apollyon.....place thy mask of darkness
Upon thy beautiful face.....become the crooked angel of pestilence
...name...I curse your Eyes,may fog with shadows of your failure and regret,...name...I curse your mind that it may be tormented by the locusts-daimons of the underworld,....name...I curse your limbs that they may ache with old age yet so early,...name...I send forth Apollyon's arrow to your heart to make it a home for worms and decay,...name...I offer you and sacrifice you in the name of
Apollyon,that you may go forth to the bottomless pit in darkness.

Burn or stab the image repeatedly.Make offering to Apollyon Far Striker.The offering should be buried in the ground.Always give thanks too the gods.

Why would someone ever want to summon that creature, he solely represents death and destruction and is said to be more powerful than the devil himself

I would assume by the invocation that it is to lay curse and misfortune onto someone. Moral philosophies aside, Apollo could certainly fit the bill for desired outcomes. No justice or vengeance in this formula, just a desire to see someone bound to weakness, failure, and to be blinded from foresight.
