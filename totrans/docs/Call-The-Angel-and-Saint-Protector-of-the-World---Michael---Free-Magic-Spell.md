PROTECTION SPELL

This is a spell to protect a person from the criticism and hate of another.
This spell can be done during any phase of the moon. You must have something
that is connected to the person, like a piece of handwriting, a picture, hair,
etc. Place this in a container, and set it aflame.

While it is burning, chant:

''Away from me
Away from me
Away from me
Away from me
So Mote It Be.''
