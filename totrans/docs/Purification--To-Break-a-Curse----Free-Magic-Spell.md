 ## Casting Instructions for 'Purification (To Break a Curse)'

*   13 candles (white)

*   1 cup sea salt

*   1 tablespoon sage

*   1 tablespoon lavender

*   1 tablespoon chamomile

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   13 candles (white)

*   1 cup sea salt

*   1 tablespoon sage

*   1 tablespoon lavender

*   1 tablespoon chamomile

 On the night after the full moon and just before bed, light 13 candles, preferably white. Fill the tub up with hot water (as hot as you can stand to sit in). Add 1 cup sea salt, 1 tablespoon sage, 1 tablespoon lavender and 1 tablespoon chamomile. Turn off the water and let the bath steep in the herbs. Kneel or sit in front of the tub, in the nude, and repeat this incantation:

"What was done was done. Be it now undone. By the light of the full moon's wane: Cleanse my soul of taint and stain. Let now my hurtful spell reverse and lift from me this vicious curse. As I enter now this sacred space return my spirit to its grace".

Enter the bath and let the water cleanse away the effects of the curse. Use your hands to gather up the water and pour it 3 times of your head. Each time you do, repeat:

"Accept my apologies for what was done. Disperse my spell with the morning's sun".

Remain in the bath until the water cools. Drain the tub and rinse off. Snuff the candles and go to sleep. By dawn the curse will be broken and you will once again find that feeling of "blessedness" that you lost.

You should fill the tub with hot water and place the herbs in to steep like a tea. As the water cools, charge it with energy. When the water has cooled to a safe level, step in and soak in the water, imagining negative energy being washed off your skin and sitting like tar on top of the water. As you soak, say the chant and imagine a protective light of positive energy filling your body. When you feel ready, pull the plug, leave the tub, and put on fresh clothes.
