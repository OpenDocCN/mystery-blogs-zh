# The difference between a pentagram and a pentacle? - Witchy Wisdom - The Spells8 Forum

So many things to say on this subject.

First organized religions always take what they don’t see as traditional to them and make it a bad thing.

They take witchcraft, symbolism, numerology, sexuality, appearance and make it bad. If they don’t like it or understand it then it’s bad or evil.

Funny thing is that they themselves use the same practices in their own religions.

Crosses, stars, pentacles, etc are all used in just about every religion and the meaning of those symbols has been distorted over time to fit within their needs.

Take Christianity for an example.

Talking to a deity (God) through a burning bush, or through dreams, meditation. Praying to a deity (God) to ask for help and guidance. The use of astrology, numerology, the ritual of baptism, salvation, Communion.

These are no different than Witchcraft. Witches do the same thing but with more knowledge, understanding, and the hunger for learning.

Satanism has many forms 99% do not worship Satan and actually believe he does not exist. They are more atheists than anything. LeVay used Satanism as a way to be sarcastic and was also controdicitary in his beliefs. A form of witchcraft was used in rituals, spells, etc.

My beliefs is that there is no right or wrong beliefs. Everyone has a right to follow their own path. It’s what you do with that path that dictates right from wrong.

We all have different gods and goddesses. Some chose Egyptian, some choose Celtic, some chose a single deity to be both make and female.

Back to symbols.

Pentalce, Pentagrams

These have been used through the years in just about every religion. The turning, placement, small changes are made to fit the religion.

My belief is that inverted or upright has its place. As above So Below. There is always an opposite. You can’t have good without bad. You can’t have left without right, you can’t have dark without light.

If you use that then an inverted pentagram is just the other side of the coin. Everyone has good and bad in them. We all have negative thoughts at times, we want for things we can’t afford it have.

It’s a fact of life. Now taking those thoughts and acting on them is what makes it bad. But! Is bad always wrong? What defines bad or evil?

That’s all in the mind of the person. Yes there are things that we all know are evil and wrong. Murder is one. I won’t list the rest because we all know the big ones.

Telling someone off because you’re angry in traffic, using curse words. I wouldn’t consider them wrong or evil but more of a negative expression. Something people can learn from and correct if they wanted to. I myself am known to let someone know when they drive bad and almost wreck me. Am I wrong for it, who knows but it was my way of letting someone know they were careless.

Anyway kind of ranting, it’s early lol.

I don’t see any reason someone can’t use both upright or inverted in practice. I have practitioners who use inverted to remind them that there is bad and to embrace that fact to better themselves because the world is not all roses.

We deal with negativity on a daily basis. Being in a inter racial marriage, having a third person in our marriage, practicing witchcraft, covered in tattoos. Instead of being angry we try to educate as best we can. Sometimes it’s just pointless and we walk away.

The point is right or wrong is sometimes just what you make of it. If you are happy, and what you use or practice helps you and others, then that’s all that matters. No one else can live your life, and you can’t live others.

If you are not out purposely hurting others and commiting crimes then it’s your life to live.

No one here will judge you for your own personal beliefs, use of symbols, or the way you practice.
