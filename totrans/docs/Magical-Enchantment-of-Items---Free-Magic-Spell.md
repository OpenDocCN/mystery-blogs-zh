**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A Fairy House or Fairy Altar

*   milk

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A Fairy House or Fairy Altar

*   milk

*   honey

*   bent and used iron items

*   Flowers such as: Violets, Roses, Lavender, Marigolds, Sunflowers and Tulips

*   Sparkly or shiny object such as a ring, necklace, or dagger

 First thing you need to do is

*   Build them a Fairy house. If not, build an altar. In this case having one or the other is crucial. You can put the fairy house inside your home or outside the home as mentioned earlier.
*   Place the offerings inside (natural and sweet tasting foods like milk and honey, bent and used iron items etc.)
*   Add colorful fairies inside the house such as Violets, Roses, Lavender, Marigolds, Sunflowers and Tulips
*   Add the sparkly and shiny object you want fairies to enchant (ring, necklace, dagger..)

With those offerings in place, whisper the following verse:

Little fairies with tiny feet
Play in this garden – but leave it neat
Little fairies with hands so sweet
I leave this offering – for you to eat
Little fairies, if this garden is neat
I’ll leave more offerings at your tiny feet.

Little folk of flashing wing,
little folk of dancing feet,
hear my words to you and bring
blessings with you when we meet.
please bless this ( insert objects you want enchanted name )
with your Power and Protection
so mote it be

Leave the object with the fairy house and the offerings.

Continue to leave little fairy treats about once a month. This spell is best done at dusk as fairies are usually asleep in the day and dancing at night.

Traditionally within faery related folklore iron is said to repel the fae. It is largely debated on why this is. One theory suggests fae may have an aversion to conductive items. I lean toward the protective properties of iron itself. Old folklore involving other protective iron made charms.

Yea I found it kind of odd that the ritual claimed that iron could be an offering to the Fey. I found the ritual online and thought that it would be a good edition to our spell book, but thanks for pointing that out.

Sometimes old, bent, used iron items can be seen as a gesture of good will. A thing broken or bent is rendered without use, comparable to bending a dead warriors sword before he is buried with it. (A dual meaning as it is now useless for revenge, and symbolic of instigating peace)

I have been working on a theory of iron and why it is hated. In old myths the fae came to the world, as the Tuatha de dancing, who warned against and defeated the fomorri by using creative nature and magic against the fomorian's more destructive natural elements.

Then man came and warned with the Tuatha, defeating them and driving them to the otherworld with iron weapons and armor, refined nature resilient against natural elements and magic. Which led to man taking over, in effect, because of superior technology.

So essentially my theory is that iron doesn't directly harm the fae, but it represents a superior weapon that creates a significant advantage. And so is feared. Akin to walking into a feudal hall for a round of trade negotiations, and presenting the group with an assault rifle. They are going to fear and, by default, mistrust you for the threat you pose.

But bring the same weapon with you, with them understanding what it is, then disassemble it in front of them and lay the pieces on the table. You are actively representing yourself as a non-threat. Making yourself willfully unarmed and vulnerable. An honorable gesture of wanting to act in good faith and from equal footing.

Ugh, sorry for the extra post. Darn autocorrect will forever be my bane. Tuatha de dancing should be Tuatha de danann.

Before, i thought: could we convert our'very long comment'in a forum or Discussion, to our articles, so we can still see it in the future?

Architecture; would be a neat idea. But the closest available method would be to make a forum post and reference where the conversation started, along with a copy of the URL for people to be able to look up where the topic came from.

Spirit76, I really enjoy your theory. From my understanding, iron was the churches answer to keeping the fae away. They had to show the people that their god was the most powerful. Their iron gates and crosses were determined to keep ''evil'' fairys away. I have asked the fae in the past with a variety of answers, the most common being ''how dare you ask'' so I have not asked in a long time. I feel it does hurt them to some degree, but I think it is more of an insult from centuries ago they have yet to forgive.

While some fae might appreciate a well maintained garden with a few treats for them, the majority do not. Plant a garden and decorate it, avoiding iron obviously, but building them a house and leaving offerings can be viewed as insulting. If you are in your garden and you brought lunch, leaving some is fine, but do not say it is an offering to the fae. Leave it on a rock, or pour it on the ground, as a gift to the land and the creatures who live on it. Once you get to know a fairy you can you discuss gifts, and even then I would research the species first. Some are repelled by gifts and it is how you remove them from your home. Fairy's are not all tiny children dancing around with butterfly wings. They can be very dangerous if you are not careful. Do your research on ancient fairy lore before attempting to build a fairy garden for them.

Thanks for the tips, I am relatively new to fairy magick, and I found this ritual online, so I figured it would be a good edition to the Spell book. Is it okay if I message you when I have questions about the Fey?

You are welcome to ask, but be aware I am oathbound so I cannot reveal certain answers.
