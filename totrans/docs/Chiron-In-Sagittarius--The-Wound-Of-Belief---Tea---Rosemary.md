# Chiron In Sagittarius: The Wound Of Belief | Tea & Rosemary

Chiron in the natal chart shows us our deepest, darkest wounds. Chiron in Sagittarius is an especially tricky placement because it’s all about our beliefs and our sense of meaning.

Almost any Chiron placement is impossible to escape. Unlike Saturn, Chiron will show up over and over, because Chiron isn’t a restriction but is instead a wound that needs healing. The only way you’ll notice it is if the wound is right in your face.

Because our Chiron signs can make our lives *so* painful, I recommend figuring yours out and working on it as soon as possible. All Chiron signs have some really great qualities if we’re able to work through the pain of the wound.

## The Chiron In Sagittarius Wound

The Chiron in Sagittarius wound is a trauma to your belief and sense of meaning. You have been wounded (in a past life or in childhood) in a way that makes it *really* difficult for you to truly believe in anything.

Even though you’re probably very good at *logically* thinking about beliefs, you might feel like you’re on a never-ending search to actually discover your own. Nothing ever feels permanent; you just don’t know what the *purpose* of life really is, no matter how hard you try.

The Chiron in Sagittarius wound is all about disconnection. You feel disconnected from your beliefs, yet you don’t even know what they really are. You just can’t figure out what it “all means.”

You might feel like life is totally meaningless and pointless, or instead you may *think* there is a “point” to life, but you just can’t figure out what it is.

## How The Chironic Wound Will Show Itself

The Chiron in Sagittarius wound can show up in a lot of different ways (depending on the house, the aspects, and the rest of your chart), but there are a few key pointers that you’ll usually see in anyone’s chart with this placement.

*This can manifest in a few different ways.*

In the first scenario, you might avoid thinking about a higher power. You feel that life is meaningless and you just can’t find purpose in any of it, so you choose to simply ignore it.

You may shut off a part of your nature in order to stop “big picture thinking” from happening. You may also feel bitter that there “isn’t” anything out there. This is the atheist who is angry at God for *not existing.*

Alternatively, you go to *any* lengths in order to find meaning. You might rely on others for answers and information, but you can never really use the information that you *do* get constructively. You might feel like nothing assimilates for you.

Sometimes, these people spend their entire lives searching for the answer. Other times, they become fanatical about religion or other belief systems, even though they don’t feel that any one system answers all of their questions deep down.

I find that people with Chiron in Sagittarius typically don’t like to be boxed in or tied down, especially in the area of the house that Chiron sits in. This is usually because they already feel boxed in by the “meaning” of life, so they can’t handle any more restrictions from outside sources.

## Where Does The Chiron In Sagittarius Wound Come From?

Typically, the Chiron in Sagittarius wound comes from a past life trauma that caused you to *stop* believing in whatever it is you felt passionately about.

This could be quite literally any kind of trauma. Whatever happened to you, the key issue is that you *thought* that the trauma happened because God, the Universe, or your belief system in general wasn’t there for you. You felt that you were left alone, so it must not be real.

Alternatively, you might have been *taught* during your childhood that there is nothing out there or that you can’t rely on beliefs or religion. You might have searched for something without ever finding it.

## How to Heal Chiron in Sagittarius

To heal Chiron in Sagittarius, you must first recognize that you’re searching for meaning through philosophy or religion, when really what you seek is a connection with your Higher Self.

Contrary to the title, your Higher Self isn’t far away and above, but within you.

You struggle to assimilate your beliefs not because belief systems aren’t real, but because the pieces of your own self are not yet assimilated.

I recommend that you work on assimilating yourself through Inner Child and Higher Self work. You have many different parts of you that feel separate but can come together with a bit of work.

The other thing that may help is to recognize that life is a *journey.* Our purpose on Earth is not to reach a destination, but to continue to learn until we grow old.

Even if your Chiron takes you on a lifelong journey to find out what *is* real out there, it’s okay. Learning to recognize that the journey is beautiful will help you to accept your Chiron while you work on your trauma.
