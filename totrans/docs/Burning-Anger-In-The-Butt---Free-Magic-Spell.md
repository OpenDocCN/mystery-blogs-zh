**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Fire-Proof Container

Relax as much as you can. Light the candle and place it on a table. Put the heat proof container nearby. It should be large enough to hold a piece of burning paper. Sit at the table and take the piece of paper and pencil in your hand and write a letter about how your feeling. Write about why you are feeling that way. Pour all your heart and soul into writing this. Be very specific and focus on the feeling while you are writing this letter. If someone/something caused you to feel this way, you may start it out with Dear So-and-So if you so wish. After you have completed the letter (it can be longer then 1 piece of paper) take it and catch it on fire with the candle. Put it in the heatproof container and gaze into the flames. See all your hurt, anger, sorrow, etc. being burned up by the cleansing flames. Visualize this until there are no longer any flames or glowing embers left. Repeat with 2nd paper if the letter is longer than 1 piece of paper. Remember to take your time when writing the letter. There is no rush. :) Snuff the candle when finished.
