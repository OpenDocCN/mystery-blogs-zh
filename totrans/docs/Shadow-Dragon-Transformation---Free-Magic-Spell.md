"Shadows,shadows enter me, bend, twist, conjure. I wish for your power to enter me, bend you at will. My loyal servant of Darkness. Dragons,Dragons, make me what I'm meant to be. With wings large enough for air, and scales no softer than steel, a powerful body no less than 200 feet tall, with jagged horned and well earned fangs, a proud dragon shall soar the skies.

Servants of Darkness and dragons flying high, take my wish, shout it, grant it, for by the time I'm done, I will soar with you as an immortal dragon of darkness. The shadows I shall bend, and even the kings will fear my name, this spell is binding, more binding than the promise of a hero! So hear my plea, for this is my wish, so mote it be!"

After you cast the spell, as of now, there is no way to turn back to human.

you cannot physically transform into a Dragon. even if you choose to work with Dragons, if you just want power, they will ignore you.

Ya, this spell does not work at all. If it does work, you CAN turn back into a human and never turn into a dragon ever again.

You cannot physically transform.
