someone try it I may want to do this

magick doesn't contradict nature, you cannot physically transform into a snake. try it yourself and see.

It does not work, YIFANXU0428\. As Nekoshema said, Real Magic is a force of nature and it does not contradict it, ergo, no snake transformations.

You cannot physically transform into a snake. This is real life, not Harry Potter.

Yeah I agree with Nekoshema and Tadashi on this one. Magic can not contradict the laws of man and morph you into a animal. Maybe your astral form but not your physical form. As Tadashi said ''This is not Harry Potter''
