Cleanse your ritual space and cast your circle, focusing especially on protection. Place the candle in the center of your pentacle. If you do not have an altar pentacle, you can draw one on a piece of paper or carve it into the candle. Light the candle and say:
''I call on powers far and near
To banish whats not welcome here.
By this candle, with this charm,
I banish all that would cause harm.
This I ask, this charge I lay.
Send unwanted things away.''
As you speak, imagine all negativity fleeing from you. Visualize the circle of light from the candle expanding and driving out anything negative. When you feel ready, pinch out the candle and end the ritual.
