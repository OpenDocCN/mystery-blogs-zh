# Powerful Wiccan Herbs and Herbal Magic for Beginners - Craft of Wicca

> 来源：[https://craftofwicca.com/powerful-wiccan-herbs-and-herbal-magic/#0001-01-01](https://craftofwicca.com/powerful-wiccan-herbs-and-herbal-magic/#0001-01-01)

Do you practice Wicca? If so, you may be interested in incorporating some of these powerful Wiccan herbs into your rituals, spells, teas, and infusions.

 Each of these herbs has its own unique properties and can be used for protection, healing, and other purposes. So, if you’re looking to add a little extra magic to your life, read on!

 ## The Basics of Herbal Magic

To me, herbal magic has 2 basic forms:

 Scented magic takes the form of essential oils, infusions, or incense. This type of use of Wiccan herbs will play a background role in the spell. You will prepare this ahead of time and then use the scent to enhance your magic.

 Ingested herbal magic takes the form of teas, food, or any other way you’d like to ingest the herb. This type of use of Wiccan herbs will be the primary focus of the spell. Your magic with the herbs will happen at the time of the spell, for example, making a love tea, which can then be drunk at any time afterward to complete the spell.

 In both cases, the basics are the same. You will find an herb or two that has natural properties to enhance the purpose of the spell.

It shouldn’t be surprising that herbs have natural properties from sleep enhancement to psychedelic—from immune system protection to enhancing fertility or love.

 These properties have been used since ancient times, and even in modern times, medical research often looks to these natural substances to find a new medicine. Science constantly confirms these powerful properties, which is part of what makes them so great to use in magic.

 Once you’ve determined the herb with the natural property you need, you will draw energy from yourself or the earth and say some words to direct that energy into the herb at the time of the spell.

Let’s get to some of the common herbs and their natural properties.

 ## Herbs for Protection

There are many different herbs that can be used for protection in Wicca. Some of the most popular ones include:

*   mugwort
*   lavender
*   rosemary
*   cedar

Each herb has its own unique properties and can be used in different ways. Mugwort, for example, can be burned as an incense to create a protective shield around your home, or it can be added to a bath to wash away negative energy.

 Lavender is often used to attract positive energy and ward off evil spirits. Rosemary is said to promote courage and strength, while cedar is thought to protect against negative thoughts and influences.

Check out my article on [DIY Wiccan Incense](https://craftofwicca.com/diy-wicca-making-incense/) from kitchen scraps. One of the key ingredients in making your own incense is a burning agent. Cedar is very cheap (and if you can identify trees, sometimes free!) and makes a great burning agent.

My favorite herbal protection spell is to make incense out of cedar.

 ## Herbs for Healing

There are a number of Wiccan herbs that can be used for healing. Some of the most popular ones include

 *   lavender
*   chamomile
*   rosemary
*   sage
*   echinacea
*   ginger
*   St. John’s wart

Each of these herbs has its own unique properties and benefits. Lavender, for example, is known for its soothing and calming effects, while chamomile is often used to help with sleep problems and insomnia.

 Echinacea is for colds and wounds. Ginger is for nausea. St. John’s wart is for depression.

If you’re looking for an easy way to incorporate Wiccan herbs into your healing practice, try making a tea using some of your favorite herbs.

Healing spells are probably the simplest of any herbal magic because most of the work is in finding the herb that has the natural healing property. The spell itself adds energy and potency to the effect, but you can also just steep the herb in hot water to get an effect as well.

 Once the spell is complete, you can drink it or give it to someone else as medicine.

## Herbs for Prosperity

When it comes to herbs for prosperity, you can’t go wrong with any of the following:

Basil is known to promote financial security, while cilantro is said to bring in wealth and abundance. Dill is thought to attract money and increase profits, and parsley is believed to promote business growth.

Prosperity magic can take a much different form than the others here. You can add dried forms of these herbs to a prosperity [charm bag](https://craftofwicca.com/wiccan-charm-bag-recipes-spells/), for instance.

 You could also smudge dried forms of these herbs to anything in your prosperity spell to add potency or even just leave the herb on your altar.

 Burying these herbs can be a part of your spell. Remember, I advocate making your own spells. They are always more powerful this way.

Add any of these herbs to your spells or incenses, or brew them into a tea to increase your prosperity.

## Herbs for Love

There are many herbs that can be used for love spells and rituals. Some of the most popular include:

 *   rose petals
*   lavender
*   jasmine
*   honeysuckle

You should learn to identify honeysuckle. It grows naturally all over the place around where I live, so it is free to collect. Foraging for Wiccan herbs is a hobby I’ve come to greatly enjoy.

These herbs are associated with love, passion, and romance, and can be used to attract new love, deepen existing relationships, or heal a broken heart.

 If you’re looking to add a little love magic to your life, try using some of these herbs in your next spell or ritual. They can help to amplify your intentions and bring positive energy into your relationship.

The easiest form of love herbal magic is to make tea, especially if you have an opportunity to serve tea to the person you want to love you back.

## Herbs for Psychic Development

So you’re interested in Wiccan herbs and want to know which ones can help with psychic development? Here are some of the most powerful herbs for this purpose:

 *   Angelica
*   Basil
*   Calendula
*   Cedar
*   Chamomile
*   Clover
*   Fern
*   Lavender
*   Mugwort
*   Nutmeg
*   Patchouli
*   Rosemary
*   Thyme

You may notice a bunch of repeats on here, but that is simply because many herbs have multiple uses. My favorite way to use these is to find one that I particularly like as a tea (lavender for me), and then make that tea daily.

Make sure to check that the herb is safe to ingest first! For instance, do not ingest patchouli.

 The daily ingestion of one of these will raise your psychic abilities and natural magical power. You could also use an essential oil form to scent the room in which you do tarot readings, divination, or simply where you sleep.

## Herbs For Care and Feeding of Your Familiar

If you’re a Wiccan, you may be interested in using herbs to care for and feed your familiar. There are many different herbs that can be used for this purpose, each with its own unique properties.

Here are a few of the most popular herbs for familiars.

 Basil is said to promote strength, courage, and vitality, and can be used to help protect your familiar from harm.

Rosemary is known for its protective properties and is said to keep negative energy away from your familiar.

Thyme is said to encourage wisdom and insight and can be used to help your familiar understand your thoughts and intentions.

 ## Herbs for Purification

There are many different herbs that can be used in Wicca for protection, healing, and other purposes. Here are some of the most powerful herbs for purification:

Basil is a great herb for banishing negative energy and promoting positive vibes. It can also be used to help protect against physical harm.

 Cedar is another powerful purifying herb that can be used to cleanse the spirit, mind, and body. It can also help to ward off negative spirits and energies.

 Peppermint is a great choice for purifying the home or workspace. It helps to clear away negative energy and promote a sense of freshness and clarity.

Sage is the traditional smudge stick for cleansing and purification before a ritual or spell.

## Herbs for Cleansing

There are a number of herbs that can be used for cleansing the body and mind. Here are a few of the most powerful ones.

 Basil is great for removing negative energy and restoring balance.

Cedarwood can be used to rid a space of negative energy, and can also be burned as incense for spiritual purification.

 Lavender is a well-known relaxant and antidepressant and can be used to calm the mind and soothe emotions.

 Parsley is a natural detoxifier that helps rid the body of harmful toxins.

## Consecration of Wiccan Herbs

When consecrating your herbs, you are essentially dedicating them to a specific purpose. There are many ways to consecrate herbs, but here are three simple methods to get you started.

The first way is to pass your herbs through the smoke of a burning sage bundle. This will cleanse and purify them, and prepare them for their new purpose.

 Another way to consecrate your herbs is to mix them with water and bless them with a positive intention. This can be done by either saying a prayer or using visualization techniques.

 The final way to consecrate your herbs is to charge them with energy using your own personal power. You can do this by holding them in your hands and visualizing a bright light surrounding them.

## Herbs for Warding

There are many different herbs that can be used for protection in Wicca, each with its own unique properties. Here are ten of the most powerful herbs for warding off negative energies and protecting yourself from harm

 *   Rosemary
*   Lavender
*   Rue
*   Basil
*   Sage
*   Cedar
*   Thyme
*   Dragon’s blood resin
*   Lodestone
*   Jet

## Herbs for Justice

When it comes to herbs for justice, there are a few that Wiccans often use.

These include:

 *   mugwort
*   St. John’s wort
*   rosemary

All of these herbs are said to help protect the user from harm, as well as promote positive outcomes in legal situations. Mugwort is thought to be especially helpful in this regard, as it’s said to increase psychic powers and help with divination.

## Conclusion

There are many different types of Wiccan herbs that can be used for a variety of purposes. Some of these herbs are for protection, some are for healing, and others can be used for a variety of other purposes.

 If you’re looking to use Wiccan herbs for any purpose, it’s important to do your research and learn about the different properties and effects of each herb.

 With the right knowledge, you can use these herbs to empower yourself and your practice.

Get creative! I’m always thinking of new ways to incorporate herbs into my practice and then recording the spells and results in my Book of Shadows.
