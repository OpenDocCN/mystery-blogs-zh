 **How to make you own Annabelle type doll. (untested, but should work.)**

This teaches you how to create a killer doll like seen in the film Annabelle. Warning: This doll (if you decide to proceed with this) is a weapon made by my race, the yuk, and one that is designed for covert assassination. You must put into circulation of it after a week as it activates a week after your creation of it. You must set the target(s) and deploy it by then...or the doll targets you. At which point, it will kill you off in a period of three days. Note: the doll takes a month to reach each target, and takes a period of three days to assassinate each target. And it assassinates each target by cause of accident(s).

**Note: **

If you are lazy, or do not know how to sew, you can simply buy a doll provided the doll is 13 inches high. and the doll in question must have a height of 13 inches. But the hair (or top of the head if it is a bald plushy) must be dyed completely red with the blood dye you shall be taught how to make.

------------------------

**1.** sew together your doll, and make it 13 inches in height, however, do not add the string or hair to do doll just yet.

**2.** prepare the dye. take a Table-spoon of your own blood, and two table-spoons of water, mix together until both are well blended.

**3.** soke the string or hair you have in the dye, and leave overnight. It should by completely red by morning.

**4.** add the now dyed string or hair to the top of the head of your doll, and form the scalp.

**5.** Capture a demon using your best method of doing such.

**6.** Force the demon into your doll, and bind the demon to the doll by this spell:  "Onto you, I bind this to you. I make it so, so mote it so."

**7\. Wait a day.**

**8. **Time to set your target(s) Ex: "Target 1 is Alfred E. Newman. Birthday Second of November, 1983"

**9. **Deploy your doll by either giving it to goodwill, or tossing it into the year of the home some little girl resides.

Annabelle is a real doll that has a demon residing inside her. The movie glorifies the tale. This spell will not work, but even if it did, do not make a demonic doll.

I wonder if that demon ever gets bored. Being stuck in a doll doesn't sound fun.

The demon is really evil, based on what I've heard, and is meant to always be kept in sacred glass in the Warren's room of the supernatural (where they store everything from past supernatural encounters). Not every entity is evil, but Annabelle definitely is. A guy in a motorcycle mocked the entity, and three hours later, he died of a car crash, I think. Anyway, you probably won't be able to make a doll like Annabelle. It would take a lot of power and energy to bind an entity that's so powerful.
