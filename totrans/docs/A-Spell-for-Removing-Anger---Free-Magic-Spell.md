# A Spell for Removing Anger

This is a quick and simple mantra which can be recited without setting up a proper ritual. It can be used for yourself or for other people. You are advised to add a very simple gesture to this spell  take a stone, and envision the anger you want to remove flowing into this stone. Feel the energy of the anger pulsate through you and into the stone. When you feel that you have transferred the anger into the stone, throw it away  preferably into a body of water where it can be cleansed, such as a stream, a river or lake.
