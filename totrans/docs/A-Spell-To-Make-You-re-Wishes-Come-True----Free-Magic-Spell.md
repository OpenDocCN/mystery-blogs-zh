is this really gonna work??

If it doesn¬ít work why does it has 5stars on it ü§î

the ranking system is broken, once a spell has a 5 star vote it can't go down, plus the creator can vote for their spell as many times as they want as well as their friends [and if they create multiple accounts] it's a popularity vote, not an accuracy vote
