Rub each candle with the oil and say :

No evil or negativity shall enter here.'

Picture a white light around you and as it increases to full intensity, picture it surrounding your home and work place/ school. Now say :

' Psychic vampires in the night
Psychic vampires who destroy my life
Destroy no more of what i achieve
Destroy no more of what i receive
Negativity is not welcome
Evil is not welcome
In me, around me or the people I love.'

Repeat this 3 times, then allow the incense and candles to burn themselves out.

You can use this as a protection against psi vampires. If you do not have sea water, simply mix salt into a glass of water. You should also wear a protection charm and learn how to shield if you are being targeted by someone.
