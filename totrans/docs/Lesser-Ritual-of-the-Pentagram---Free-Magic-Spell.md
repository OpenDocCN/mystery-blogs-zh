> 来源：[https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/banishing_spells/6742/page.html#0001-01-01](https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/banishing_spells/6742/page.html#0001-01-01)

The element which is getting invoked or banished depends solely on the way that you trace the pentagram
the way to trace them correcponding with the element is as follows:

*Air
Invoking - top right to top left coner
Banishing - top left to top right corner
*Fire
Invoking - top middle to bottom right corner
Banishing - bottom right to top middle corner
*Water
Invoking - top left to top right corner
Banishing - top right to top left corner
*Earth
Invoking - top middle to bottom left corner
Banishing - bottom left to top middle corner

First take the steel dagger in your hand (you can use your right index finger instead of a dagger)
Face EAST

Perform the Qabalistic Cross as follows:
Imagine, at the first word intoned, a brilliant white light descend from above.

Touch the forehead and vibrate

> ATEH

Imagine that same brilliant white light form a 6 inch diameter sphere just above the crown of your head.

Touch the middle of the solar plexus and vibrate

> MALKUTH

Imagine a shaft of light descending from the Crown Sphere and descend to the feet where another 6 inch sphere expands just under your feet.

Touch the right shoulder and vibrate

> VE-GEVURAH

Imagine a 6 inch sphere of brilliant white light appear just next to the right shoulder.

Touch the left shoulder and vibrate

> VE-GEDULAH

Imagine a shaft of light emerge from the right Sphere and cross your breast to expand and form another Sphere at your left shoulder.

Clasp the hands before you and vibrate

> LE-OLAHM

At this point imagine clearly the cross of light as it extends through your body.

Hands as before, with the dagger between the fingers, point up, vibrate

> AMEN

Note: Any image or figure traced in the air with the finger, dagger or other magical instrument, is to be imagined in brilliant scintillating white Light. In more advanced working, other colors may be used. Make sure that all images drawn are correct, as brilliant as possible, and complete. The beginning and end of a drawn Pentagram must come completely together.

Draw, in the air facing EAST, a Pentagram (it's tracing wau depends which elemt you wish to invoke or banish), and bringing the point of the dagger to the center of the Pentagram, vibrate the Name

> Y-H-V-H

(pronounced YAHD-HEY-VAU-HEY)

Imagine that your voice carries forward to the very limits of the universe.

Without moving the dagger (or finger) in any other direction, trace a semicircle before you as you turn toward the SOUTH. Again trace the Pentagram, bring the dagger/finger to the center of it, and vibrate the Name

> ADONI

,

Again, trace the semicircle with the dagger to the WEST, trace the Pentagram, bringing the dagger/finger to the center, and vibrate the Name

> EHYEH

,

Then, turn towards the NORTH, while tracing the circle, trace the Pentagram, bring the point of the dagger to the center and vibrate the Name

> AGLA

, (can be pronounced either AH-GAH-LAH or ATAH GIBOR LE-OLAHM ADONAI)

Return to the EAST, completing tracing the circle of brilliant white Light, bringing the dagger point to the center of the EAST Pentagram.

Extend the arms in the form of a cross, say:

> BEFORE ME (then vibrate)
> 
> > RAPHAEL
> 
> Imagine a scintillating brilliant white Archangel in front of you and facing you. In his/her right hand is a magical Sword held with the point upright. The background is a pale, pure, bright yellow. Cherubs can be imagined near the Archangel. Imagine a gentle, refreshing breeze, cleansing and purifying the air.
> 
> Then, say:
> 
> > BEHIND ME
> 
> (then vibrate)
> 
> > GABRIEL
> 
> Imagine a scintillating brilliant white Archangel behind you and facing you, holding in their right hand an exquisite silver Chalice. He/she is standing on a Cerulean-blue ocean and dolphins or mermaids are nearby. Imagine feeling the mist and cool spray of the ocean breeze.
> 
> Then, say:
> 
> > AT MY RIGHT HAND
> 
> (then vibrate)
> 
> > MICHAEL
> 
> (pronounced MEE-CHYE-EHL)
> 
> Imagine a scintillating brilliant white Archangel at your right, facing you, and holding in their right hand a transparent scarlet red Wand with a scintillate pure diamond top. Waves of scarlet, red-orange and orange fire in the background. Also, SEKHMET, with a scarlet disk above her head, emerald green Uraeus, scarlet dress from just below breasts, tight-fitting, down to her ankles, is in the flames. She holds, in her left hand, a scarlet-red lotus wand. In her right hand, she holds an emerald-green ankh. Small black salamanders can be seen moving among the flames. Imagine you feel the heat and power emanating from the SOUTH.
> 
> Then, say:
> 
> > AT MY LEFT HAND
> 
> (then vibrate)
> 
> > URIEL
> 
> Imagine a scintillating brilliant white Archangel at your left, facing you, and holding between their hands a Disk with a scintillating white Pentagram in the center. The ground is russet-brown, the leaves of the trees are olive-green, there are black shadows from the trees in a number of places, and the light is citrine (light yellow-green.) Feel the solidity of the Earth, and imagine the odor of the leaves and muskiness of the ground.
> 
> Now, say:
> 
> > ABOUT ME FLAMES THE PENTAGRAMS, AND IN THE COLUMN SHINES THE SIX-RAYED STAR
> 
> .
> 
> Imagine the complete circle of brilliant white light at whose quadrants are the 4 Pentagrams. At the center is the Cabbalistic Cross of Light extended through one's body.
> 
> Then you shall repeat the Qabalistic cross, as done in the beginning of the ritual, and, according to some occultists, stamp your right foot at the conclusion of the complete operation. The Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is performed preliminary to any magical operation and precedes the Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.
> 
> Note: The subject of the vibration of Names of Power is discussed at length in other sources. The Names should be pronounced inwardly in the breath, vibrating it as much as possible and feeling that the whole body throbs with the sound and sends out a wave of vibration directed to the ends of the Earth, according to Regardie. Time and continuous practice of the ritual, an invoking ritual, in the morning and a banishing ritual, in the evening, are standard recommendations, and will produce the desired result. There is no particular frequency or degree of volume that is suitable for every individual. Each person must practice to find the resonant vibration that will work for him/her. Some benefit can be obtained by listening to the chants of Tibetan Monks that can be found on cassette and CD. Other occultists assert that definite somatic effects will manifest when the vibrated Names are performed correctly, such as tingling in certain areas of the body. I believe it is important to vibrate the Names at the same time one imagines the Name in scintillate white Light, rushing upward through the body and outwards toward the end of the Universe in the particular direction one is working with. It is important to pronounce the Names correctly and clearly and, according to Traditional Jewish sources, never pronounce the Names casually, but only in Holy or Theurgic Work. One is admonished to NEVER lower the hand or Magical Instrument while tracing the Circle or at any other time, unless specifically instructed to do so. It is designed to use the banishing variation of the ritual after it's invoking variation.
