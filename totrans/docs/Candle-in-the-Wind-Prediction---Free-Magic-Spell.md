 Find a night when there is no moonlight shining. Sit down on the bare earth and stick your white candle down in the ground. Feel free to go outside earlier and sit upon the earth for 5-10 minutes or so. This allows you to just relax your mind and feel the earths energy all around you. right when it turns 11:10 PM, speak aloud your wish so the earth and wind will hear you. Let the earth and wind decide the wish prediction in complete silence until the next minute comes. Right when it turns 11:11 PM, light the white candle. Focus on the candles light and your wish. If the wind. Doesn't blow out the candle by 11:13 PM, then your wish will come true. If the wind does blow out the candle by 11:13 PM, it is a sign from the wind that your wish will not come true. No matter the outcome, be sure to thank the wind for its answer because it knows best.
