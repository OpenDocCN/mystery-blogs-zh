**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Agate, amber, or peridot

If you are unsure when the Day of Jupiter is, a Thursday will work just as well. Though, it is optional. The conjuration will just have a higher success rate on these days.

Start by applying the coconut, jasmine, lotus, ylang-ylang, or maple scents to yourself or the room you are working in (Incense or oils, though real pieces of coconut shavings or maple syrup will work)

Sit in a chair or on the ground comfortably with your eyes closed. Your offering (Agate, Amber, Peridot, ect) should be within your palms. How you interact with Chamuel now, is up to your personal self. If you are clairvoyant, you will see him within your mind's eye. If clairaudient, you will hear his riddle-ridden voice. Clairsentient, you will feel his meditative energies.
