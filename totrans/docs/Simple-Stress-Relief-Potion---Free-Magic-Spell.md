I think you meant ''diabetes potion'' yeesh. A warm glass of milk can help. A warm glass of milk sweetened with a little lavender sugar would be also helpful. Chamomile tea is very soothing. Sugar combined with sugar will probably result in more stress since you will be energetic.

Lavender tea is also good for you health-wise. Say like you are experiencing problems sleeping. This calms you down. I don't really prefer drinks because it doesn't calm me down as well. Maybe a nice relaxing bath with some Epsom bath salts will work since it does for me. Idk.
