## Is Today Your Birthday?

Do you know your definition of success? Do you know your path to fame and fortune? If you have not yet thought it through then you need to, because what occurs over the next few months will help you turn dreams into realities. You must have a plan.

### AQUARIUS

You will need to deal swiftly and sternly with someone who tries to muscle in on your territory today. Don’t listen to their lies and excuses – make sure they know you are not amused and simply won’t stand for it. Be firm. In fact, be furious.

### PISCES

Minor setbacks are likely today but they won’t add more than a few minutes to your journey or a few dollars to your bill, so take them in your stride. And if something, or someone, goes out of your life, wave it, or them, a fond farewell.

### ARIES

You may be tempted to take a hard line on a controversial issue but don’t come on too strong. The last thing you want is for others to see you as some kind of extremist. Sometimes the middle of the road is the safest place to be!

### TAURUS

The more someone talks today the more carefully you must investigate their claims. Chances are they are talking fast in an effort to bamboozle you so you don’t see they have no real idea what they are going on about. Don’t be fooled.

### GEMINI

As Mercury, your ruler and planet of the mind, moves in your favor today you will be receptive to new ideas. Remember though that just because an idea is new does not mean it is good. Check, double check and then triple check all the facts.

### CANCER

You have everything you need to make a great job of a difficult task, so get on with it and show the world what you are capable of. Anyone who doubts your ability will soon see you are a force to be reckoned with – a force of nature no less!

### LEO

You may be tempted to make criticisms of a personal nature today, especially if people you have to deal with are deliberately obstructive. That will only inflame the situation. Stay calm and let them see you won’t be riled. The crisis will pass.

### VIRGO

You cannot choose to hide from a problem. If you try you will only make the problem bigger over time. The only way you are going to solve your current dilemma is by getting directly involved. Make it your mission to make things right.

### LIBRA

Try not to get worked up about situations that mean nothing in the greater scheme of things. The planets indicate they will work themselves out in the end, so why worry? Stay true to your essential Libra nature: relax and take life in your stride.

### SCORPIO

You will be on your toes from first thing in the morning until last thing at night today, and that’s good. The planets suggest that you need to be busy and you need to push yourself closer to your physical and emotional limits – though not beyond them!

### SAGITTARIUS

No matter how committed you may be to an idea, a cause or a belief, you still have to accept that not everyone is going to see things the same way as you. By all means be outspoken today but temper it with understanding and humility.

### CAPRICORN

You must avoid making promises that are likely to tie you down, personally, professionally and

financially. There are only so many hours in a day and you have enough on your plate as it is without taking on more time-consuming commitments.
