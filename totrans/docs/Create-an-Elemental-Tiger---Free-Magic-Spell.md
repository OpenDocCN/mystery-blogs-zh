**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Ruler(Needs to have 12 in.) or a tape measure

 Read the following before you get started.

Draw what your tiger will look like. Color your tiger according to its element or just color your dragon then find out its element by its color. Draw you next to your tiger. Write down your height next to you. Color yourself (optional)

Make lines to the top of your body according to your height. (example: five feet. Draw five equal lines.) Now continue to make your tigers height. Underline the heights of you and your tiger.

Fold paper hamburger style. So you cant see your drawing. Fold it only once. Now write its info with a pencil on either side. (Name, Fur color, tail, Accessories, strength, behavior, abilities, element, breed, eyes, what it eats, etc.)

Fold paper hamburger style again so you can't see the words. Now write this and say it as you write it allowed: "(its element) tiger of mine, come to me, by egg of (its element again). I summon the newborn mythical creature. So mote it be". ("So mote it be" should be written as big as you can.)

Now fold it hamburger style so you can't see the words. Make a pentagram on one side. Fold it once more. Now every night for three nights, before you sleep, chant: "God/ Goddesses, grant my dream tiger in the real world from egg to end. Then, chant: (its element) tiger of mine, come to me, by egg of (its element again). I summon the newborn mythical creature. So mote it be". ("So mote it be" should be written as big as you can.)

Kiss the paper after you chanted and put it under your pillow. As you fall asleep, dream of you and your tiger coming together. If you stop in the middle, just simply read what you have. You need actual belief in this or else you will not get an egg.
