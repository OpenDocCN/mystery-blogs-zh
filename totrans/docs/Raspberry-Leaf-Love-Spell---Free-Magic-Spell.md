**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Raspberry Leaf Tea (loose leafs available at most health food stores)

*   Lavender Oil

*   3 Floating Candles

*   Bowl

*   Lock of your Hair

*   Piece of your Clothing

 Timing

This spell must be performed three nights in a row. Begin two nights before the full moon. On the third night you perform the spell, the moon should be full. The spell is far less potent if performed during any other time. This spell is also best executed outside under the light of the moon and barefoot (so that you are firmly connected to Mother Earth).

Procedure

Begin by preparing the tea. Next, fill the bowl with water and add 3 drops of lavender oil. Place the candles in the bowl and light them. Cut off a lock of your hair, add it to the bowl and place the bowl on the ground. Take three sips of the raspberry tea. Place the tea on the ground next to the bowl. Walk around the bowl seven times, repeating softly to yourself the name of the one you love. Take three more sips of tea. Walk around the bowl another seven times repeating **"I (your name) desire (your love's name) love".** Blow out the candles. Cover the bowl with your piece of clothing. Finish the rest of the tea before you go to sleep.

Repeat this ritual on the second and third night. On the third night, the night of the full moon, bury your lock of hair. Pour the water from the bowl onto the bare earth over it. Wear the piece of clothing while you finish the tea. Give the candles to a close friend for safekeeping.

This is a powerful spell. Do not practice it lightly!
