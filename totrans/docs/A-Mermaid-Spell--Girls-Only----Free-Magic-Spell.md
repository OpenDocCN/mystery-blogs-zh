Take the blue candle and place it in front of you, take the red candle and place it on the right side of you, take the white candle and place it behind you, and take the green candle and place it on the left side of you. Next, light the candles. Take the perfume or body mist and spray some on you, it does not matter where you spray it, nor how much. Take the necklace and put it on. Make sure that there is ocean sound playing in the background. Chant this five times: Goddess of the Sea, oh, hear my plea! Send a Mermaid Tail to Me! Make all the boys fall for Me! Send Water, Fire, Air and Earth control to this body! Make me smell like the perfume I always wanted! Oh, Goddess of the Sea, will you hear my plea? After you chant the spell, blow out the candles in order (blow the blue out first, blow the red out second, blow the white out third, and blow the green out fourth) Do not touch water for the rest of the day. That morning, you should have your mermaid tail. Happy Swimming!

You cannot become a mermaid.

You may not believe in mermaids but some people do.

I never said I did not believe in mermaids, I was stating a fact about Magic; You can not physically shapeshift. No amount of belief will change facts.

Tadashi is correct, Magik cannot defy the laws of physics.

Okay look, maybe your mom will buy you a mermaid tail for your birthday but that does not mean your a mermaid, you will forever be a human, h a p p y s w i m m i n g .

You need belief for spells to work

You also need the spell to be physically possible. No matter how much one believes, you can't become a mermaid. (Ignoring the fact that there are plenty of paths and individuals that use things other than belief to make their spells effective.)

I don't have candles

You can substitute candles. The spell outline claims each candle represents an element, so you could swap it with another representation. It could be coloured objects like beads or cloth [yellow=air red=fire blue=water green=earth] or you could use other representations [feather=air spicy food=fire water=water salt=earth]

You do not need candles, for this is a fake spell. You cannot physically become a mermaid.
