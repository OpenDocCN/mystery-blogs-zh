*   Pillar candle (St. Michael)

*   A stick or skewer to puncture the candle

*   White taper candle (optional)

 If you have a pillar candle, you're going to poke 4 holes into the top. Try to make sure they are across from each other forming a square - *this represents the 4 elements* . Do this **counter-clockwise** . As you do this, you are removing any negative energy from the candle. Make sure the holes are big enough to fit herbs into. Next, put in your herbs first in each hole **clockwise** . If you have any oils, put 3 drops of each oil in each hole **clockwise** - *the 3 drops represent the Holy Trinity* . If you have a white tapered candle, drip the wax into each hole **clockwise** until they are all sealed. As you do that, say,

> ***"As I will it, so mote it be."***

Light the candle and make sure that it burns all the way to the bottom. Once this is done, you have been uncrossed. If it doesn't burn all the way down, then make another candle. Repeat this until a candle burns down completely. This will keep you undo and protect you from crossings.

Note: If you don't have a pillar candle rub the ingrediants on the outside of the candle.

Simple and effective, next time you think someone's cast on you, use this.

May I change the incantation? I mean that's too short, maybe? Gonna mix it up with other spell?

Since the ''So mote it be'' is basically standalone here, should my typical replacement of ''As above, so below, as within, so without, as the universe, so the soul''? I understand them to have the same meaning, but sometimes I think I don't understand ''So mote it be''.

You can tweak any chant to suit your needs. If ''So mote it be'' doesn't resonate, you can go with anything you consider signifies ending a spell [I usually use ''So shall it be.'' No real reason. I think I watched The Craft one too many times. Sometimes, I'll just clap my hands to signal the end of a casting]
