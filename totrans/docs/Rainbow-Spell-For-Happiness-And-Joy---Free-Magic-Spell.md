# Rainbow Spell For Happiness And Joy

ou Will Need: 7 Candles, 7 Ribbons and 7 Flowers, in each case one in each color of the rainbow. The rainbow colors also represent the old planets of the Zodiac: Red for Mars, Orange for Sun, Yellow for Moon, Green for Mercury, Blue for Venus, Indigo for Jupiter and Violet for Saturn. Tie each candle at the base with its matching colored ribbon. In each of seven rooms in your house, or seven places in one room if you live somewhere smaller, place one candle with its matching flower in a stem vase, to make a simple yet colorful alter. Open all the windows and ask for nature's blessings: promise to honor nature more attentively in the future, by leaving out crumbs for the birds, growing more plants and flowers, not killing creatures who come inside and recycling as much as you can for the sake of the environment. Promise, too, to try t0 smile more and not to criticize others too much. Light your candles in the order of the Rainbow colors (as above) and feel the color of each light burning into you. Sit in the middle of the room (or house) and surround yourself mentally with the swirling light of every colors. After one hour, extinguish the candles and untie the ribbons, then wind them loosely together into a braid. Repeat this procedure for six more nights, undoing the ribbons from the braid, and retying them them each time. At the end of the week, when the flowers will have wilted and the candles burnt down, take the ribbons and weave them into a tidy braid. This will become your most powerful talisman, and will always attract Rainbow colors into your life. Recharge the braid at an open window on one day of every month, and always keep it in a special place.
