**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 White Candle

*   1 Black Candle

*   1 Amythest

 Take a white and black candle for balance. These will be the energies you are using and focusing on. Energies from the night and day. Use also a stone to bring about emotions for the energies to get into. Preferably an Amythest. Have also an herb you use for cleansing. Light both candles and sit the stone in between and your herb ready to ignite.
Say,

"Divine powers of night and day
I invoke thee now, Come this way
Into my home, into my space
Purify all beings and things
Push out the bad, bring in the light
To ease our bodies from everlasting plights
Cleanse the emotions of the living that dwell
Rid us of the past, so that it away will sail.
So mote it be."

Ignite your herb
