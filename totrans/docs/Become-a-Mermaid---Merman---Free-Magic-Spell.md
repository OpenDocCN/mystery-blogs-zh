You cannot become a mermaid.

Am I wrong for saying this but mermaids aren't real

It's your opinion and judging by the current evidence, it's fine to conclude that. [just be prepared to defend your opinion when nay-sayers come calling. And trust me, they will]

This is not a love spell.

that kinda hurts my feelings because your saying it not real and i belive in them

I did not say mermaids were not real, I said this spell was not real. Physical transformation is not possible with Real Magik. Mermaids are not physical beings, they are spiritual.
