# Draconic Elemental Charging of Blades

  Rated 5/5 Stars

The purpose of this ritual is to charge a ritual blade with the elemental forces of nature

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Normal altar equipment

*   Blade to be charged

## Casting Instructions for 'Draconic Elemental Charging of Blades'

Step 1: take the blade to be charged to a location where it will not be disturbed. If you trust the blade will come to no harm, sink it 3-6 inches into the ground (if you don't have an area of ground you can safely use, the blade can be placed in a large pot of soil) and pour a circle of salt around it approximately 12 inches in diameter and say:

In the name(s) of (personal deity), I ask the Dragons of the Elements to touch this blade and infuse it with elemental power! May all the forces of power and justice, as unstoppable as this storm, be drawn into this blade.

Step 2: Call upon the Guardian Dragons of each Gate to individually touch the blade with elemental force. If you have regular Gate guardians and you know their names (or the names they use when working with you) then call their names at the beginning of each invocation.

Great Dragon of the East, and all the Dragons of Air, riders of the storm winds, weavers of Wisdom, make this blade straight and true for the honor and glory of my Gods, my Dragon friends and my Clan!

Great Dragon of the South, and all the Dragons of Fire, whose power is manifested by the lightening bolt, hold fast the power of transformation within this blade that it may better aid me in my service to my Gods, my Dragon friends, and my Clan!

Great Dragon of the West, and all the Dragons of Water, you who swim the ocean currents and bring the cleansing rains, rinse away all doubt and uncertainty of purpose from this steel and s/he who wields it that both may be as unstoppable as the raging flood in defense of justice and the innocent, for my Gods, my dragon friends, and my Clan!

Great Dragon of the North, and all the Dragons of Earth, shakers and shapers of the World, keepers of mystery and secrets, keep strong this blade and s/he who wields it that I may be able to see into the heart of mystery and with it's aid discern the truth in any situation for the glory of my Gods, my Dragon friends and my Clan!

Step 3: Ask for the blessings of the Gods by saying:

(Name(s) of deity) , I ask that You pour forth Your blessings upon this blade, and that You touch it with Your powers, that it may be a worthy magical weapon, aiding me as I work in Your service.

Step 4: Go back indoors if you wish, or remain outside, until the storm has passed. Meditate on the desired effects of the ritual for at least 10-15 minutes. When the storm is over give thanks to the Gods and the Dragons for their assistance. Take up the Blade and immediately give it a thorough cleaning and oiling

This can work, but if you work with Dragons and not a specific deity you can just skip the part with the deity because Dragon Magick is a path working with Dragons, no deities involved [unless you choose to include deities in your path] Dragons can bless your tools if you ask them.

If you are blessing the item like an athame to be used in Magikal rituals, this should work. If you are hoping for a flaming dragon sword, no.
