# Anna Maria's Weight Loss Spell

  Rated 5/5 Stars

Anna maria's note: This is a spell to help you lose weight. Results may take some time to show, and you also need to make some practical effort to help your spell. No weight loss spell works if you eat a liter of ice cream daily. We can do this much for the Gods, right?

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Anna Maria's Weight Loss Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Small Yellow Candle

*   Paper or a small plate on which will the candle burn.

*   Waxing Moon

*   Night, when you can see the Moon

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Waxing Moon

*   Night, when you can see the Moon

It is best to do this spell outdoors where you can see the Moon, but the open window will do too.

Take the candle and point it to the sky, imagining it as a link between the Moon and you. Tell it that its' purpose is to help you lose weight. Inscribe it with your wish, preferably in your own language. You can write in runes or another alphabet you like, or add symbols that remind you of thin woman or man etc. meditate a bit on your wish to be thin and imagine how you make efforts to lose weight (excercise, diet) and imagine yourself looking great. then say:

''Tonight I come to you young Moon
Help my efforts to not be in vain
help me now to loose my burden
may I lose so you may gain. ''

The remains of the spell throw away. They represent what 'melted' off you.

By inscribe it with your wish do you mean literally carve into the candle?

Yeah, that's what it means :) You'll find with many different spells you'll be asked to carve into a candle you'll be using during the spell.

This could work. As mentioned, eating healthy and exercising will make the spell work better than if you simply say it and wait to see results as you relax on the couch with some ice cream.

This appears to be a working weight loss spell. As the author mentioned, you will need to put forth mundane effort. Weight loss spells help with cravings, motivation, and seeing results sooner. Weight loss spells do not make you a size two instantly without effort.
