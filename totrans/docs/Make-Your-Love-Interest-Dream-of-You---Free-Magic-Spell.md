# Make Your Love Interest Dream of You

This will make your love interest (crush, SO, ex) have either a romantic or an erotic dream centered around you. In my experience, this spell works in roughly three weeks' time but it may be different for every person.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Make Your Love Interest Dream of You'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Red candle (optional - for an erotic dream)

*   Pink candle (optional - for a romantic dream)

*   White candle (optional - substitute for red or pink if you don't have them)

*   Red wine (optional)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Red candle (optional - for an erotic dream)

*   Pink candle (optional - for a romantic dream)

*   White candle (optional - substitute for red or pink if you don't have them)

*   Red wine (optional)

 1\. Cast this spell right before you go to sleep.

2\. Light up the candle, place it on the surface in front of you, and hold your palms around the candle at a safe distance. Close your eyes and feel the warmth of your passion fill your body. When your chest heats up, visualize the dream you want your love interest to see you in.

3\. Chant the following:

O [person's name], may what you see

In your sweetest dreams be me.

Want me, crave me every night.

Feeling this you cannot fight.

Think of me, dream only me.

It's my will, so mote it be.

4\. If you're of legal drinking age and don't have any conflicting conditions, drink the red wine and feel it fill you with warmth and power. Feel the power flow from you to your love interest, wrapping them up in your passion. 

5\. To help this spell manifest, you may want to text your love interest a short goodnight message right after the casting.

Can you replace the red wine with something else?

Pomegranate juice [or just red juice]

You could use a drink that has an aphrodisiac effect, such as raspberry, damiana, rose petals, etc. :)

What does **hold your palms around the candle at a safe distance mean?** Does it mean hold the candle? Hold my palms together with the candle in the middle like I'm hugging the candle? Or simply hold my hands in front of the candle? Thank you, and blessings!

I believe they want you to charge the candle with magickal energy. You can hold the candle, but once the candle is lit, cup your hands around the candle a few inches away [so you're not burned] and visualize/feel the energy travelling down your arms, leaving your hands, and pooling in the candle.
