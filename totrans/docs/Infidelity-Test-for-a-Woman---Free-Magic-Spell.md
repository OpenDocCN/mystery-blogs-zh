 ## Casting Instructions for 'Infidelity Test for a Woman'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Plastic wrap

*   1 string that has been bound around a whole chicken

*   40 twist ties

*   1 gold and diamond anklet

 Wrap the anklet in plastic wrap. Make two strings of 20 twist ties each. Braid them with the string from the chicken, starting with the string in the middle. Bind your gift with the braid. Watch closely as she opens it.

If she breaks the string, she will not be faithful. If she tears the plastic wrap, she will break your heart. When the anklet is revealed, if she puts it on herself, she is selfish in bed or hard to satisfy. If she asks you to help, you shall both be happy and faithful.

Please don't just rely on this. It might not be accurate.

Firstly, this is fake. Secondly, this would be a form of divination. Thirdly, do not waste your time on this nonsense. There are better, and actual working, spells to choose from. If you suspect cheating, just talk to your partner.
