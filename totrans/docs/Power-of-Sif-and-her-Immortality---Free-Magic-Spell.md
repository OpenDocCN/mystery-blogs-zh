You cannot gain a Gods powers, this is real life, not The Craft.

You cant get God Powers Magic doesnt work like this-

Gotta admit, when first reading the title I thought of the great grey wolf Sif from Dark Souls. I may just play a few too many video-games.

That said, as others have already stated a spell such as this would fail to provide the desired results. Or any results for that matter. This kind of effort just doesn't lie in the purview, or purpose, of magic.

Now then, I had best put together a swift apology to Sif for considering her as an angry wolf wielding a very big sword.
