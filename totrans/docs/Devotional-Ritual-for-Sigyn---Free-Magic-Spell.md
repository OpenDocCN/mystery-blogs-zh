**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A large bowl

*   Altar space

*   Food (your choice)

*   Drink (your choice)

*   2 candles

*   Incense

 Begin by setting up an altar dedicated to Sigyn. Place a large bowl in the center of the altar. Put one candle on the left side of this bowl, and another candle on the right side. Light both candles while reciting the following prayer:

"Sigyn, beloved wife of Loki, mother of Narvi and Vali, Lady of the Gentleness, Lady of the Staying Power. I hail you. Grant me Your courage, which is that of an open yet invincible heart. Grant me Your humility, which is that of mindful devotion to Your love. Grant me above all that I may be of service to You, Your husband, Your children, and to all Gods who might have use of me. Hail, Sigyn".

Take a portion of food and drink (ideally a portion of a meal you had intended on eating) and offer it to Sigyn on the altar, while saying "For Your time in the cave, when You starved and went malnourished in duty to love. May it nourish You". Take the bowl in both  hands and lift it above your head, "May I hold this bowl in Your stead, Lady. May I take Your place in the cave tonight, for a few brief moments". Hold the bowl above your head for a determined amount of time (as long as you feel right) to symbolize what Sigyn did for Loki.

When finished, snuff out the candles and light an incense. Allow the incense to burn out as an offering. Leave the food on the altar until the following morning.
