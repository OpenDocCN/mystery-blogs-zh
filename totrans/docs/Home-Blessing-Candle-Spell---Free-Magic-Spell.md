**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 blue or purple candles

*   3 sticks of incense in:

*   sandalwood

*   frankincense

*   rosemary

*   3 copper pennies

*   A bell

The candles need to be large enough that a penny will fit in the candle holder under them. Set the candles up in a even triangle, and put one penny in each candle holder, under the candle.

Light one candle and say ''Bring me hope'', then light the sandalwood incense. Ring the bell.

Light the next candle and say ''Bring me peace'', then light the frankincense incense. Ring the bell.

Light the last candle and say ''Bring me good fortune'', and light the rosemary incense. Ring the bell one last time.

Set the incense burners within the candle triangle and let everything burn for at least an hour. An afternoon is better to really get the energy of the incense flowing in the house, but it isn't necessary. Snuff out the candles when you are done.
