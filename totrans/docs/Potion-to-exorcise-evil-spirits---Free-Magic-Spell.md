 boil the water, and add the dead leaves to it, as if you're making tea. Stir it with the bramble, if a thorn falls into the water it'll be even more powerful. DONT ACTUALLY DRINK THE WATER, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF LEAF YOU GRABBED. Use the same bramble as a wand when exorcising evil spirits, or use it to brush the water in haunted places. As the water dries, the evil is dispelled.
