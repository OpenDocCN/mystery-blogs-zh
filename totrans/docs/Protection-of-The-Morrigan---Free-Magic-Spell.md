# Protection of The Morrigan

A devotional protection spell to The Morrigan.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Protection of The Morrigan'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Protection reiki candle from crystal journey candles

*   Native Spirit Incense, Raven Spirit

*   Lighter

*   Peacock ore, chalcopyrite.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Protection reiki candle from crystal journey candles

*   Native Spirit Incense, Raven Spirit

*   Lighter

*   Peacock ore, chalcopyrite.

 **On your altar:**

Place your peacock ore away from your candle as to not wet the stone at all with any wax, as getting this stone wet is possibly dangerous. 

Place your incense within a holder and light it. I use these particular candles and incense along with work with The Morrigan as intuitively I feel they represent the goddess well.

**Chant:**

"My Morrigan, I give to you this flame and ask for your protection. May your wings find me safe, and ever protected."

Relax now and enjoy your ritual. Allow the candle to burn down until you are comfortable with snuffing it out. Enjoy the incense, and let yourself relax.
