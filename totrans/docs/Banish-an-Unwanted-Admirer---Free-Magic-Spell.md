Have an unwanted admirer?? Want rid of them forever?? Then this is the perfect spell for you.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Banish an Unwanted Admirer'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Vervain leaves

*   Matches/lighter

*   A well-stoked fire

*   Waning moon

*   Outdoors

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Vervain leaves

*   Matches/lighter

*   A well-stoked fire

*   Waning moon

*   Outdoors

Cast this spell three days or nights in a row when the Moon is waning. If you can't get your hands on fresh vervain leaves, use the dried ones that should be available at a local herbalist. You'll need about a handful of either. The spell is best cast outside. If this is not possible, it can be done indoors, but as it involves a fire, it must be done with great care.
Consecrate the wood or coal before lighting the fire. When it is burning fiercely, throw the vervain on to the flames, calling out the name of the person you want out of your life as loudly and with as much passion as you can muster. Follow the name with these words, which should also be said with passion:

I need you not.
I want you not.
Leave my life now
And come back never.
And it harm none, so be it.

Spend a minute or two visualising the person's face in the fire's smoke and watch it waft away from you - forever.
