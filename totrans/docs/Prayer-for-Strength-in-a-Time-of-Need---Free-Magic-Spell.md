**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   focus

*   space

*   something to offer

 To begin, I recommend that you meditate until you are focused, however, this is not required. Lower yourself to your knees, in a bowing position, and chant calmly focusing on your words and them reaching the deity your are praying to.

"Gods and Goddesses hear my call. I fear for my safety and beg on my knees, oh help me to protect myself and my home grant me the power. I need to be known. Oh help me please. I offer (Something decent) in return for your deeds."

This spell can be modified in many ways, if you wish it. You may work in a specified power so you know what your getting or you cant trust them to decide.

It might work, but in a dangerous situation, I do not think you want to say a long chant. I would consider grounding your energy, making yourself invisible, and stealth yourself out of the situation. Please note, when I say ''invisible'' it will not be physical, invisibility spells make people overlook you by grounding your energy. If you wish to test this chant, I would do so before a competition over waiting until you are in danger.
