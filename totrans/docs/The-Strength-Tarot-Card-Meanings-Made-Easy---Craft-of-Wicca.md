## Classical Strength Card Tarot Interpretation

The classical meaning of The Strength tarot card can be seen in the Rider-Waite deck.

 The lion is a sign of bravery, passion, and desire, all of which are essential human emotions for survival. However, if these emotions are not suppressed, they might lead to our demise.

 When the card Strength comes in a tarot reading, it indicates our own strength. This might apply to our bodily strength or, more typically, our spiritual and mental strength.

Strength’s tarot meaning exudes a powerful, supporting spirit that assures you that you are capable of accomplishing your goals. You have the innate power to endure whatever is currently holding you back or bringing you pain and unhappiness.

 The woman is dressed in a white robe to signify her spiritual purity, as well as a belt and crown of flowers to represent nature’s fullest, most beautiful manifestation. Over her head is an infinity sign, indicating her limitless potential and knowledge.

 ### Upright Strength Card Meaning

The upright Strength card has a straightforward meaning:

**The upright Strength card represents that during times of danger and difficulty, you have inner strength and courage. It demonstrates your capacity to remain calm and powerful even when your life is in a state of turmoil. This is accomplished not by attempting to control the other person, but rather via soft nudging, support, and empathy.**

Your inner power provides you the confidence to face any new anxieties, problems, or concerns. Feel the fear, but go ahead with it.

 If you’ve gone through a difficult period and are feeling burned out or worried, the Strength card advises you to discover the strength inside yourself to endure.

 You have what it takes to bring this scenario through to completion. You’re a devoted friend and steadfast supporter, always eager to step up and be there when others are in need, and you may also feel obliged to hold space for someone who requires your strength and support.

In romance, it might also signal the start of a relationship with someone with a bit of a crazy side. This might be a thrilling possibility, but if this individual is very wild, you may feel compelled to tame them.

 In a professional setting, Strength signifies that the moment has come to conquer your emotions and go forward. You have the abilities and the potential; all you need to do now is be courageous and believe in yourself. Don’t let fear of failure or humiliation keep you from pursuing your goals and realizing your full potential.

The meaning is easy to remember by just reading some of the upright card keywords off of the symbols:

 *   Lion = taming through calm
*   White robe = Spiritual purity
*   Infinity = Infinite knowledge leading to strength
*   Belt = Natural world

In terms of health, the Strength Tarot Card is a fantastic card to have. It’s typically a sign of good or improved health and feeling as though you’re in top shape.

It also depicts the heart and soul regaining their equilibrium. Now is an excellent moment to make healthy lifestyle adjustments, particularly ones that ask you to use greater self-control.

 ### Reversed Strength Card Meaning

Reversed, Strength has the opposite meaning:

 **The Strength card reversed indicates vulnerability, self-doubt, frailty, low self-esteem, low confidence, and a sense of inadequacy. You might be lethargic, especially if you’ve been devoting yourself to helping others or pushing yourself to reach a goal. **

Strength Reversed is an opportunity to take stock of your energy levels and recover them temporarily by relaxing and retreating. It’s critical that you look after yourself so that you may look after others.

 It shows that you are allowing fear, worry, or poor self-esteem to paralyze you rather than a lack of strength. You must summon your inner drive and self-belief now more than ever to get yourself out of your current circumstances.

 You have the strength to overcome your challenges. You’ve just lost contact with it, and the resulting separation makes you feel weak, vulnerable, and insecure. Concentrate on the positive, avoid those who make you feel insecure, and hang out with people who encourage you.

When Strength is reversed in a love tarot reading, it might indicate a degree of codependency in your connection. This might be due to insecurity, which makes it hard for you and your lover to be more self-reliant and follow your own interests. Being full-fledged persons with your own lives adds to your partnership, not subtracts from it.

 In terms of career and money, the reversed meaning of the Strength Tarot is analogous to the upright reading in that it shows that in order to advance in your work, you must be bold and have self-confidence.

 It indicates that you have been allowing fear and worry to drag you down. If you let it, your fear of failure may paralyze you. Let rid of your self-doubt; it’s not good for you. You are more capable, skilled, and capable than you realize.

## Modern Interpretations

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, and so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation for the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question differs. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

 We’ll use a different deck for every one of these. Today’s is Shadowscapes.

This card emphasizes the taming aspect. The woman isn’t just fighting with the lion’s mouth, she seems to have full control of all of nature. The animals respect her, and the lion holds a sphere for her.

 The posture is much nobler. She has command and looks out over her domain confidently and calmly. Remember that your strength doesn’t always have to mean constantly exerting control. Take time to enjoy that you have control of many aspects of your life.

She is on a bridge, and this shows that maybe you are crossing into a new area of your life. You’ve conquered and gotten control of the current situation, and it is time to continue into a new domain.

## The Strength Tarot in Context

Context matters a lot when reading the cards. Here are some particularly strong things to look out for when the Strength card appears in these contexts.

 *   Past: You’ve overcome some difficulties and are ready to move on.
*   Present: You have the strength to control the situation, but kindness may be the answer.
*   Future: Gaining control is within your grasp. Look for inner strength.

For other types of readings:

*   Hobbies: Don’t let anxiety or humiliation keep you from pursuing your goals and realizing your full potential.
*   Love: You’re beginning to regain control, and whatever issues you’ve had in the past have pushed you closer.
*   Work: You may make significant progress in your work if you can control your animalistic inclinations, such as rage, desire, and passion.
*   Finance: Make daring purchases, possibly putting your money toward something you’ve long wanted.
