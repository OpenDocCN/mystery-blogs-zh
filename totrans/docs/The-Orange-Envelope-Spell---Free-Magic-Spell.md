~ Hold the leaf in your power hand:

Green; the colour of Nature, this leaf i did pluck
And as this leaf is green, please bring me luck.
And harm none, so mote it be.

~ With the leaf still in your power hand, pick up the flower in the same hand:

Yellow flower in Earth did grow,
On me, please, good luck bestow.
And harm none, so mote it be.

~ Now the blue flower while still holding the leaf and yellow flower:

Colour of Spirit at your behest
I ask by this spell that i be blessed.
And harm none, so mote it be.

~ Place the three in the bowl, and as sprinkling the dirt over them, say:

As I sprinkled with Mother's soil
May I remember that I still
Must work hard and I must toil
if I am to have my will.
And harm none, so mote it be.

~ Focus on the bowl and repeat the last invocation twice more, seeing yourself gaining luck. once you feel it is fully charged, pour the contents in the orange envelope and place it somewhere where it will not be disturbed. Whenever you feel you need more luck, take it out, hold it between your hands [like you're praying] and focus on the luck aiding you. Be sure to thanks the deities for the luck you have gained from this spell.

Are there any naturally occurring blue flowers?

Cornflowers are naturally blue, there are likely many others depending on what grows in your local areas.

I've used forget-me-nots in the past and it worked fine.
