## Tools and equipment needed

[Natural witch](https://www.magickandwitchcraft.com/post/green-witch) or green witch practices will often require tools and equipment that you may not have access to. Fortunately, making your own herbal sprays is easy and accessible to anyone who can find the right ingredients. While you can certainly make the spray ingredients ahead of time, it’s best to have them on hand ready to use as needed.

#### You will need:

*   **A glass or stainless steel bottle with spray head** - Make sure the bottle you use is glass or stainless steel. Plastic bottles will not only leach chemicals into the herbs, but can be also negatively effected by exposure to pure essential oils.

*   **A funnel** - If you don’t already own one, make sure you get a funnel that’s large enough to hold your ingredients. A smaller funnel will make the process much more frustrating.

*   **A dropper** - Helps with the right dosages of essential oils, if you are using them.

*   **A scale** - If you can’t measure anything accurately, you will waste ingredients. A scale allows you to weigh out ingredients accurately, so there’s no guesswork involved. Alternatively you can use measuring cups.

*   **An appropriate sized bowl** - The bowl you use will depend on the recipe.

*   **Herbs and Essential oils**

> **Special Tip** : Instead of using normal water you can cold-infuse your herbs overnight in moon water. This is especial great for meditation and relaxation sprays.
