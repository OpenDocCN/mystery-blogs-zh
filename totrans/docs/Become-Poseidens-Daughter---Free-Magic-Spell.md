Haha, this chant is funny. But I don't believe you can transform into another being like a Mermaid. Also if anything were to happen at all based on how the Greek Pantheon normally rolls, he would probably just try to get in your pants. So maybe you can give birth to a Mermaid daughter...or a fish, or squid...or horse. Idk whatever feels like popping out really considering the options of what this pantheon has produced so far.

You cannot become a mermaid. You can work with Poseidon and dedicate yourself to him, but you will not become a mermaid as a result.
