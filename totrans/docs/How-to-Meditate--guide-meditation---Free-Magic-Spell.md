**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your Mind

*   A Deep Breath before you begin

Find a comfortable spot, indoors or outdoors(preferably one more quiet). Sit with your legs crossed and put your hands in your lap. Now close your eyes and visualize a blank space. Feel a breeze come by you. In this stage,you are Open-Minded. Be careful here as bad spirits can try to intimidate you. This will break your relaxation. If you open your eyes if you are insecure, close them back and feel positive energy flow trough you by taking a few deep breaths.

In this next stage, it is going to take all concentration. You will be meditating ! I reccomend you be meditating COMPLETELY as I told for at least 1 minute or more. The calmer you are the better.

The time you need to meditate depends on your level of anger or fustration.
