does this really work?

This is a fake spell, vampires in this way are not real and you cannot become a different creature with magick or awaken a mythical creature inside yourself, it simply isn't how it works.

how long do i have to wait

Madisyn, vampire spells do not work and will never work, vampires do not exist and you cannot become one with or without magick (unless you are just playing dress up). You are human and will always be. No matter how long you wait, you will not become one.

You are human, you cannot become a vampire. Vampires as seen in popular culture are not physical beings, ergo you are not one.

Are there any side effects?

considering that vampire spells don't work since you can't become a vampire, I'd say the only side effect would probably be the energy of the spell having nowhere to go and hanging around.

First off, nice to see another Genshin fan [love Itto] But, to answer your question, no. As Draq said, vampire spells aren't real [specifically spells claiming to turn you into a physical blood-sucking vampire] Side effects from these spells are usually psychosomatic [placebo effect] or the result of charging a bunch of energy that has nowhere to go [because you can't physically transform] and the energy just bounces around your home for a while, effecting you, making you feel sick/unwell, until the energy fades away. You might want to look into psi vampires. You can also try working with astral vampires, deities associated with vampires, using vampire imagery in your craft, or working with blood magick [but be careful with blood magick. Not because it's powerful and taboo, but because you could get an infection. Use a diabetic needle to prick your finger and only use a drop. You don't need a lot of blood, and you should NEVER slice your hand open for a spell]
