**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Sage Smudge Sticks

*   Salt

*   Brass or Silver bell

*   Feather

*   White Vinegar

 Start by opening all windows and doors in your home to allow fresh air in, and to get the stale air out. Now, wash down your walls with white vinegar. When you are finished, light sage smudge sticks and, using the feather, waft the incense smoke throughout your home; moving in a clockwise motion through your residence. 

Use the bell to do the same, ringing it while you move throughout your home. All the while, visualizing your actions ridding your home of negative and/or parasitic energies. Finally, sprinkle the salt around your home and then sweep it and the last of the negativity out of your home.
