## What is a Tarot Journal?

A tarot journal is a personal record or diary to document one’s experience with tarot readings.

 It is a way to reflect on and document the meaning and significance of the tarot cards that are drawn during a reading. You use it to record insights and observations about the process of reading the tarot.

To use a tarot journal, you can begin by setting aside a specific time and place for your tarot readings. You might choose to do a daily or weekly tarot reading, or you might do a reading only when you are seeking guidance or clarity on a particular issue.

 Before you begin your tarot reading, it can be helpful to set an intention or ask a specific question that you would like the tarot to help you with. This could be something general, like seeking guidance on a particular decision, or something more specific, like trying to understand your feelings about a particular relationship.

 As you draw and interpret the tarot cards, you can use your tarot journal to record your thoughts and observations about each card and its meaning. You can also write down any insights or revelations that come to you during the reading.

 After you have completed your tarot reading, you can review your journal entries and reflect on the guidance and insights that you received from the tarot. You may find it helpful to revisit your journal entries from previous readings and see how the advice and insights you received then have played out in your life.

Using a tarot journal can be a helpful way to deepen your understanding of the tarot and to track your personal growth and development over time. It can also be a useful tool for exploring your own thoughts and feelings and for gaining clarity and insight into various aspects of your life.
