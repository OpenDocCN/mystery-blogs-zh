# Herbs For Protection: The 35 Best Herbs To Keep Negative Spirits Away | Tea & Rosemary

> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/herbs-for-protection/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/herbs-for-protection/#0001-01-01)

For beginner *and* advanced witches, protection spells should always be #1.

There are so many elements to protection spell work, including wards, bindings, banishing, etc. It can be really helpful to know what protection *herbs* are strong and what purposes each herb is used for, especially in a pinch.

I find that learning about herbs can be kind of difficult unless you have a clear focus. Today, I’ll be talking about all of my favorite herbs for protection *and* the various ways to use them.

Hopefully, this post will help you when you’re in a pinch. You can stockpile some of these herbs and use them if you encounter negative entities or when you need to cleanse.

*Here are my 35+ favorite herbs for protection!*

## How To Use Herbs For Protection:

I’ll talk more specifically about how to use each herb for protection in the list below, however most herbs can be used in a few basic ways.

**Make A Wash:** You can create a “potion” using water and the herb to wash your hands in. I keep these washes handy and use them before doing spell work. This wash can also be used for your floor, home, or anything else that needs cleansing.

**Brew A Tea:** If the herb is safe to consume, brew a tea then drink it to protect your body and your energy. Make sure that you infuse the tea with your specific intention to activate the properties of the protection herb.

**In The Bath:** Again, make sure to check that the herb can be safely exposed to your skin. Once you are aware of the safety of the herb, drop some into your bath and do a protection cleansing. Bath spells are super easy and effective, so I use bath cleansings quite often.

**Hang Dried Herbs: **You can simply hang a bundle of dried herbs over any doorway or window that you want to protect. I hang spiritual protection herbs over my bed to keep entities away while I’m dreaming, and I also have a small bundle in my car for protection while traveling.

## The Best Protection Herbs:

Here are my favorite herbs for protection with information on the specific protective properties and ways to use each herb.

## 35\. Rosemary

If I had to choose, I would say that rosemary is one of my all-time top herbs for protection. Rosemary is *so* strong and requires very little activation.

Rosemary is specifically one of the best protection herbs for *purification* purposes. If you need to cleanse something, burn rosemary in the air, or keep a small satchel of rosemary around your home. You can also brew a potion (even just water and rosemary works well) to cleanse your hands before performing a ritual.

## 34\. Salt

Though salt isn’t technically an herb, I had to include it high up on this list of protection herbs because salt is simply one of the best substances *ever* if you’re in need of serious protection. 

A bowl of salt, left out, will automatically cleanse any room. I keep salt handy during all my rituals. You can also sprinkle salt in the corners of your home or across the doorway for strong physical wards, or you can cleanse your tools in it.

Salt is one of the best protection herbs for *all* types of protection and cleansing. However, I find that it works especially well for spiritual/energetic cleansing.

If you’re in a pickle, salt can be used as an *offensive* means of protection. Throw salt on the ritual or item that is causing problems and the energy will be forced to dissipate. 

## 33\. Rose

Rose isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you’re looking for protection herbs, but it’s surprisingly effective.

The idea is that, because the thorns on the rose protect the flower, the flower will then transfer this protection to you or your spell work. Therefore, roses can be used for *any* type of protection because the power of the rose is mainly metaphorical.

I especially enjoy using rose petals in satchels, but I also make rose tea from time to time or even use the thorns after I get a bouquet of roses.

## 32\. Dragon’s Blood

Dragon’s blood is actually resin from a tropical palm tree. It’s surprisingly popular in the witchcraft community because it has so many uses, including strong protective powers.

I find that dragon’s blood is especially useful if you need to ward off psychic attacks. You can burn dragon’s blood incense or put some of the resin in a protection pouch. It will also cleanse or clear any space.

## 31\. Thorns

Though “thorns” aren’t actually an herb, you can source them on the stems of various flowers. I find that thorns are super useful in protection spells because of the metaphorical meaning.

A thorn quite literally protects the flower or plant from animals. When you use thorns in a spell, this power will be transferred to you or your spell. 

Place thorns in a satchel or spell jar or use them in a tea, depending on the type of flower that you source your thorns from.

## 30\. Mint

Mint is a truly versatile herb. It’s also one of the best herbs for protection. I specifically use mint as a *home* protective herb.

Hang bundles of mint around your door/windows, brew a home protection potion, use it in a spell jar, or even add it to your food or drink.

## 29\. Rue

Because rue is super easy to grow, it’s also one of the most perfect protection herbs to use when you’re in a pinch. I always have some dried rue hanging around. 

I find that rue is one of the best herbs for protection when you *specifically* need to banish. For example, I will sometimes incorporate rue into my [freezer spells](https://teaandrosemarycom.bigscoots-staging.com/how-to-cast-freezer-spell/). 

You can utilize rue to banish actual people, spiritual entities, or even bad habits. Rue can also be used in cord cutting spells.

## 28\. Dill

Dill is one of the most useful protection herbs if you need to keep dark forces at bay. Negative entities, leeches, and energetic vampires can all be banished using dill.

However, dill is also said to stimulate lust, so I don’t recommend using it as a *physical* protection herb if you’re heading to a crowded location.

## 27\. Mistletoe

Although mistletoe has many uses, it’s specifically one of the best herbs for protection when you need to *physically* protect yourself or your home.

Hang mistletoe over your door to ward off unwanted intruders or wear mistletoe on your person as a preventative measure. Mistletoe can also be used in ritual baths, though it *is* a poisonous herb, so you shouldn’t ingest it.

## 26\. Oak

Throughout history, the oak tree became a symbol of protection. The tree is strong and sturdy, so oak will provide the sort of protection that lasts over time.

Oak is one of my favorite protection herbs to use for bath/cleansing spells. It also works quite well in a jar spell or satchel. You can even use oak if you enjoy arts and crafts, because it’s easy to create an incognito piece that hangs on your wall for decor but also protects your home.

You can utilize oak leaves, bark, acorns, or even the dirt from under the tree to harness the protective properties of oak.

## 25\. Black Pepper

Red pepper is more commonly used in witchcraft, but I personally *love* black pepper. It’s one of my favorite protection herbs when I want to energetically protect my home or my body.

Black pepper is especially useful for warding against the evil eye. In fact, it will sometimes return the evil eye to the sender. I use black pepper in spell jars or satchels, but it can honestly be useful in just about any type of protection spell.

Overall, black pepper works best to keep negative energy, curses, and malevolent spirits from harming you.

## 24\. Red Pepper

If you’re looking for protection herbs that are quick and effective, you may want to consider using red pepper. After all, red pepper is super popular in the witchcraft community for a reason!

You can use red pepper flakes, chili powder, cayenne pepper, or whole chili peppers. In many cultures, a bundle of chili peppers is hung over the door to ward off intruders.

I find that red pepper can be used to protect against energy/entities *and* physical harm. It’s one of the strongest herbs for protection that works *extremely* quickly. 

Red pepper *can* be aggressive offensively and may return negative energy or even physical force to the sender, so don’t use it on anyone you want to stay close to.

## 23\. Garlic

Vampire legends are definitely based on some truths: garlic is one of the most *potent* protection herbs. However, garlic can be used against basically anyone, not just vampires.

In witchcraft, garlic is used for spiritual protection, exorcism, the repulsion of vampires (energetic or otherwise), and protection against negative magic.

It can be used for both spiritual and physical purposes. Garlic even kills off disease, so it’s one of the best herbs for protection against illness.

## 22\. Agrimony

If you need to utilize protection herbs in your warding spells then agrimony should be your #1 choice. Just sprinkling the herb around any area will instantly create a ward.

I specifically use agrimony to ward against the Fae (if necessary), entities, or evil spirits. It’s easy enough to sprinkle some agrimony under my doormat. Agrimony provides an extra layer of warding that makes me feel more comfortable, plus it *really* works!

## 21\. Birch

Throughout history, birch was seen as a symbol of protection. Whether you simply plant the tree itself outside your front door or utilize birch as one of your go-to protection herbs, birch is extremely effective.

I use birch for general protection. It’s both spiritual and physical. Birch is said to protect against lightening, storms, and the evil eye; I’ve found this to be true, but it also works in just about any protection spell or even in a bath.

Lastly, birch is purifying, so it’s a great protection herb to use as a cleanser.

## 20\. Angelica

Known as the Angels’ herb of protection, Angelica is a powerful substance that can help you call upon the power of the angels. Use this for just about any situation.

You can grow angelica in your garden, place it around your house, or use it during spell work. However, make sure that you have good intentions when using angelica. Angels live by a strict moral code and won’t help you if you intend to curse or hurt anyone.

## 19\. Hawthorne

A sacred Celtic herb, hawthorne is one of the most historical herbs for protection on this list. It has been used in folk magic for centuries.

Hawthorne is specifically helpful when you need to ward off ghosts. It was also used by the ancient Romans to protect a baby from evil spirits and negativity. However, it is sacred to the Fae, so be careful if you happen upon a patch of Hawthorne in nature – don’t disturb the plant unless you have permission.

## 18\. Aloe Vera

Though aloe vera is known as a health-related herb, it’s also one of the best herbs for protection. Aloe very tends to protect from most physical accidents and acts as a quick antidote to many illnesses or injuries.

Some witches also use aloe vera to protect against negative energy or the evil eye, specifically in spell jars or baths.

## 17\. Elder

In centuries past, elder was often grown in a ring around one’s property as a means of protection. Even if you aren’t able to actually grow elder bushes around your house (though it’s a cool idea!), elder can still work as one of the protection herbs that you employ in your spells.

[Hedge witches](https://teaandrosemarycom.bigscoots-staging.com/hedge-witch/) love elder because it quite literally creates a hedge or barrier. Elder keeps the good spirits in and the negative entities out, so it does the discernment work for you.

## 16\. Ash

Because ash isn’t traditionally known as one of the stronger protection herbs, it isn’t usually seen on this sort of list. However, I wanted to include ash because I think it’s of the *best* herbs for protection, specifically during travel.

Simply make a pouch filled with ash or include ash in your travel jar safety spell.

Ash is also useful for safety from the water and prevents drowning.

## 15\. Bay Leaf

In folk magic, a bay leaf is a type of catch-all. The bay leaf is a really powerful herb that works for so many types of spells!

However, I find that bay leaf is specifically one of the most powerful herbs for protection. You can put it under your pillow to ward off bad dreams, wear it on your person for physical cleansing, make a wash with bay leaves, or place the leaves throughout your home to strengthen your wards.

When in doubt, I always slip a bay leaf into my protection spells.

## 14\. Pine

I *love* pine trees. I grew up in a home that was surrounded by massive, old pine trees, but I never realized that the trees themselves are what gave me such a sense of security.

Pine is one of the most well-rounded herbs for protection. There’s a reason that most floor wash recipes include pine!

You can make various washes with pine (for your floor, bath, hands, etc.) or you can brew a pine needle tea for good health. If you’d rather burn the needles, you can use the smoke to drive away evil spirits.

Pine is also one of the best protection herbs to ward against physical illness. During the holidays, I place pinecones all over my house and keep out sickness as well as negativity and evil spirits.

## 13\. Frankincense

One of the most purifying protection herbs on this list is Frankincense. It’s used in so many religious homes of worship for a reason!

Frankincense is actually linked to the sun, so when you burn or utilize this protection herb, you’re essentially calling upon sun gods. 

I like to burn incense in my home to cleanse my space, but you can also use the powder in spell jars or satchels. 

## 12\. Lily

Centuries ago, witches grew lily in their gardens to keep negative spirits away. Plus, lily is easily one of the prettiest herbs for protection!

Kept in a satchel or on your person, lily will protect you against the evil eye. It’s also effective as a tool to break spells or curses cast on you, especially love spells. The tiger lily is especially aggressive magically. 

## 11\. Eucalyptus

Eucalyptus is a highly healing herb, but it’s also one of the most positive herbs for protection. When you use eucalyptus, you’ll purify your space *and* heal your energy or body all at once.

I tend to use eucalyptus when I’m performing gentler protection spells. For example, a daily cleansing with eucalyptus will softly rid your aura of negative energy, but you won’t feel drained after. It’s also great for bath spells.

However, you’ll want to pick something stronger for a cleansing if you have a serious problem with an entity or spirit.

## 10\. Valerian

Valerian is another catch-all herb that can be used for protection spells. It’s great for baths or washes because it has strong cleansing properties.

My favorite way to use Valerian is to calm emotions. If someone is upset or a situation feels out of control or scary, valerian will quickly calm everyone down. You can also wear it on your person to calm those around you.

## 9\. Cactus

One of my favorite protection herbs for banishing is cactus. Simply having a cactus in your home or garden (especially by your door) creates an automatic ward that repels intruders.

Cactus is also great for banishing spells. You can make a satchel or bag filled with cactus and other banishing herbs then bury it. Otherwise, place cactus in the four corners of your home for extra protection on the daily.

## 8\. Vervain

Vervain isn’t just used in the Vampire Diaries. It’s actually a real protection herb that’s used quite often in the witch community.

Although vervain was most traditionally used to protect people and their homes against lightening and storms, this herb is highly cleansing, too. Use it in baths, floor washes, spell jars, or simply in your home to cleanse and purify the energy.

I also like to put vervain near my bed as a cleanser for unwanted entities and spirits that flock while I’m dreaming. It’s one of the best protection herbs to prevent nightmares. Vervain is also one of the best herbs to use for protection [during Samhain.](https://teaandrosemary.com/samhain-rituals-traditions-ways-to-celebrate/)

## 7\. Parsley

Parsley is a strong cleansing herb that will remove most curses and hexes. It will also cleanse negativity in general.

I like to carry parsley on me to ward against any negativity or the evil eye. It’s also an effective ward against illness. It can be placed in a satchel or used in an oil.

Parsley is one of the edible protection herbs on this list, so it can be used in food, tea, or other concoctions! It’s a largely protective herb that has many uses, both spiritual and physical.

## 6\. St. John’s Wort

Generally, St. John’s Wort is used to prevent against *all* forms of dark magic. This means that it will repel curses sent towards you, but it can also protect from unintended consequences from your own spells.

This protection herb is also useful for warding against bad spirits and for banishing all evil entities. Try burning this herb during a banishing spell.

If you wear St. John’s Wort on you, then your *own* convictions will be strengthened while your opponent will grow weaker.

Lastly, St. John’s Wort is said to protect against fire, lightening, and other natural disasters.

## 5\. Flax Seed

Although flax seed isn’t one of the most common herbs for protection, I find that it’s very effective. You can mix it with red pepper to create a strong ward for you home.

Alternatively, you can sprinkle flax seed in just about anything, such as your bag, your shoes, your closet, your car, or anything else that needs a bit of protection. Flax seed offers physical protection, so I like to use it when I’m traveling or going somewhere.

## 4\. Willow

Every part of the willow tree is used for protection. A willow is graceful yet sturdy, so it’s a wonderful herb for protection because the properties don’t *seem* obvious, yet the energy of the willow is strong over time.

The willow tree is associated with the divine feminine. You can call upon various benevolent female goddesses using an offering of willow.

Willow can also be used to give yourself strength when you feel that you’re lacking. This is one of the protection herbs that *feels* subtle, yet willow can help to create changes in your life so that you’re safer and more energetically focused in general.

## 3\. Red Clover

Typically, red clover is one of the main protection herbs used for warding domestic animals. If you want to protect your pet, start with red clover!

This herb is also helpful if you need to remove negative spirits around your home.

## 2\. Sandalwood

One of the best protection herbs for clearing negativity is sandalwood. It both protects and heals, so I tend to include sandalwood in most of my protection spells.

You can scatter or burn sandalwood in your home to clear it of negative energy, or you can use sandalwood in a spell jar, satchel, or potion.

## 1\. Vinegar

Although vinegar can’t technically be classified as an herb, I had to include it with these other protection herbs because vinegar is *so* powerful.

Make a floor wash with vinegar for cleansing, use a few drops in your bath, or employ vinegar in any other potion or spell. Vinegar is especially useful for cleansing, banishing, binding, and as a preventative measure to avoid evil.
