## Casting Instructions for 'Multiple Baby Conceiving Spells'

Spell to Give Birth to a Healthy Baby

If you are worried that your unborn child may be ill or be born with an inherited problem, cut an apple in half. Take one half and rub the fruit over your belly. Envision any sickness being drawn out of your womb and out of your child, and into the fruit. When you are done, bury that tainted half an apple in the ground, away from your baby's nursery window. Then go wash up, you are probably all sticky.

If a tree grows from the seeds left in the buried apple, this is an indication that your child will be very strongly linked to the element of Earth, and will never know hunger.

Eat the remaining half while envisioning your baby being born happy and healthy. You may wish to light a green, pine-scented candle while doing this. Green candles are great for healing spells, and pine is associated with Earth and fertility. If you are allergic or can't eat apples, throw it out, but take the time to do the visualization.

(The apple doesn't have to be green. I just used a picture of green apples.)

Spell to Conceive a Son

During your most fertile time arrange three candles in a triangle. At the top should be a yellow one (Sun), to the left a green one (Earth) and to the right a blue one (Rain). These are the symbols of the Father. Take a dried Oak Leaf and in red ink write the following: ''Sow in my womb a son as tall and healthy as the mighty Oak''. Place the leaf in the center of the triangle. Next, place an acorn on top of the leaf, repeating the following:

''From this seed is born the Sacred Oak
From this union is born my beloved Son''

Visualize a tree growing, from the first shoots pushing through lush soil, the slender sapling, all the way up until the tree stands strong and proud. Its leafy arms spread above you. Hold this image in your mind for a few minutes. Picture the leaves rustling with the breeze, the sun shining through here and there. Now, picture an infant lying at the base of the tree, gently cradled in the protruding roots. Picture him as you would like your son to be, happy, healthy, smiling. Hold this image for a few moments.

When you are ready, take the acorn and place it under the mattress before making love. Let the candles burn down. Each night before attempting to conceive, repeat, using new candles but the same leaf and acorn.

Keep in mind, this spell increases the likelihood of conceiving the gender you seek. This means you may not conceive at all if the potential child was of the opposite gender! So think long and hard about using this spell.

Spell to Conceive a Daughter

During your most fertile time arrange three candles in a triangle. At the top should be a silver one (Moon), to the left a brown one (Earth) and to the right a blue one (Water). These are the symbols of the Mother. Take a rose (blossom only) and place it in the center of the triangle. Using a thorn from the rose stem, prick your finger and squeeze three drops of blood on top of the bloom. Repeating the following:

''Sweet as the rose may be, and as strong as the thorn
From this union of flesh and spirit, my daughter is born''

Visualize a rose bush growing and flowering before you. Its blossoms smell sweet and the thorns are proof that woman is both beautiful and powerful. Soft and strong. Hold this image in your mind for a few minutes. Picture the leaves rustling with the breeze, butterflies drifting around the blooms. Now, picture an infant lying at the base of the bush, gently cradled by the curling stems and buds. Picture her as you would like your daughter to be, happy, healthy, smiling. Hold this image for a few moments.

When you are ready, take the rose and place it under the mattress before making love. Let the candles burn down. Each night before attempting to conceive, repeat using new candles and a new rose blossom.

Keep in mind, this spell increases the likelihood of conceiving the gender you seek. This means you may not conceive at all if the potential child was of the opposite gender! So think long and hard about using this spell.

Spell to Improve Chances of Conceiving a Child

Fill a warm (not too hot) bath and add 3 drops of lemon oil, 3 drops of orange oil and 3 drops of lime oil. Take turns bathing one another thoroughly (no soap, just a clean cloth and the scented water), until the water cools. About 30 minutes. After you have bathed and before love making, each of you should drink a half a cup (4 oz.) of caffeinated coffee or tea. Caffeine improves sperm motility in males and studies have shown women who drink this amount of caffeinated tea each day improve chances to conceive up to 200%.

After making love, the male should place several pillows under the woman's hips, tipping her pelvis up and back. This makes it easier for the sperm to travel to the ovum. To help alleviate the discomfort this awkward position can cause, he should remain with her and massage her feet and calves. This stimulates blood circulation through out the body including the womb. This position should be held for 30 minutes.
