> “Fluorite, the stone of focus and decision making”

Hi and welcome to Wicca Now. As you may already know, Wicca Now is a site where Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/), this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or this article on [turquoise](https://wiccanow.com/turquoise-the-beautiful-stone/). Today I thought we’d focus on another beautiful crystal, namely Fluorite.

## About Fluorite

Its colour can range from transparent to almost all shades of the colour spectrum and it has a vitreous lustre. Most types of fluorite exhibit strong fluorescence and some types will even glow in the dark when heated.
