# Herb Bundles for Purification

Instructions for making your own herbal bundles to burn for purification of yourself and your space.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Herb Bundles for Purification'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Garden snips 

*   3 Stalks of fresh basil

*   3 stalks of fresh  sage

*   Twine 

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Garden snips 

*   3 Stalks of fresh basil

*   3 stalks of fresh  sage

*   Twine 

 Cut the stems of the plants so that they are all equal in length. Take the base of the stems and carefully tie them together with twine. Hold the stalks of the herbs upside down and slowly tie them together, spacing the tied portions about an inch apart in length. Continue wrapping the string around the length of the leaves until the entire bundle is wrapped in the string. Wrap the string around the bundle in a criss-crossing pattern. Don’t tie it too tightly, you don’t want to cut off portions of the leaves or stalks. You want it just tight enough that the plants stay snug in the bundle you’ve made.

Once you are done, hang the bundle up to dry. It usually takes about a week or two, depending on the moisture of the plant. Make sure they are stored in a cool, dry place with proper airflow or the bundles will mold, and you don’t want that. 

When dried, the bundle can now be burned during smudging ceremonies or when cleansing space for ritual and spell work. 

**Safety Note:** Some plants can produce toxic fumes when burned so be sure you have researched the herb you are working with to be sure that it is safe to burn.
