Coming Night please hear my plight
Bring coldness and bury friendship's light

Let all ties break and end.
So Mote it Be

For how long do you pour vinegar on the lemons and repeat the spell? A day? One week? A month even? Also what does bury the lemons in the earth where the sun rises and sets on them?
