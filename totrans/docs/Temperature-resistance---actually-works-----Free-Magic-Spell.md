While you can use energy work to help you feel hot or cold in certain situations, it is an energy technique, not a spell. This spell probably will not work for most people outside of a placebo.

A placebo is something that tricks your mind into believing something is real. Your mind then tells your body it is real, and your body reacts physically to the influence of the brain. Sugar pills have been given to people, told they were actually medicine, and improvements in the persons health has been documented.

So you're saying it won't work for most people so you're telling us that it can kind of work ? or you saying that the spell works like placebo?

This spell does not work as outlined. This spell can trick people and create a placebo effect. Energy work is not a spell. You need to know how to control and direct energy for spells to work. Think of it like a spell called ''running spell'' and the instructions were ''walk fast.'' Yeah, that is how running works. When you charge energy, you can feel warm. When you ground energy, you can feel cold. This is not a spell, this is the nature of Magikal energy.
