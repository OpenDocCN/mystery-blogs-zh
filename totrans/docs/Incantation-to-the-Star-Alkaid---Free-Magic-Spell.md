*   Equipment: A censer with hot coals in it.

*   Vestments: A white robe with a blue hood.

 Constellation:

  Go out at night when the star Alkaid is in the tenth house. Bring as much fortune as you can to the tenth house and the ascendant, and let the lord of the ascendant and the lord of the tenth house look on the ascendant with an aspect of friendship; and let them be free from all misfortunes and well-placed in their dignities, and let them aspect each other.

Fume: 

Mix the storax, the aloes, and the spikenard together, two ounces each, and one ounce of the bone, pounded.  Mix with the finest old wine, and form the mixture into lozenges, which store for a later time.

Spell: 

Put some of the pills on the coals in the censer.  As the smoke rises, face toward that part of the heavens where Alkaid is, and say: 

"Baneful thou turnest, Benethnays.  The Bear shakes thee from her shaking tail, her anger upon thee.  Go proud, Benethnays!  Thirst in thy wrath to strangle the foeman." 

Then cast yourself down upon the ground, and say and do these things many times, naming the one whom you wish to afflict and supplicating and calling upon the star.
