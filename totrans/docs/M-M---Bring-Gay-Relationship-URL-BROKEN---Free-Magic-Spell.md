# M/M - Bring Gay Relationship URL BROKEN

This spell will help a man find a man. However, the URL for sigils is no longer active. I am not sure on how to delete the spell.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'M/M - Bring Gay Relationship URL BROKEN'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Yourself, a pen or marker.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Yourself, a pen or marker.

 Draw this sigil  (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3IQMRPLm7GJsivG-uNqAqWmXI-VGVC7/view?usp=sharing)

on your palm and over your heart either with your finger or a marker. 

Draw this sigil ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBfFrHI9jLWmgOpIe79aHRrXcklEK7Qm/view?usp=sharing )

connecting the X sigil on your heart to the one on your palm. 

Finished Sigils should look like this (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pdXSah21wTVCeNVA1Hu3ARKmkzaVaovv/view?usp=sharing)

Since the sigils are inactive, you can repeat the spell three times while drawing a heart on your palm with a marker, your mind, or your finger. Keep drawing the heart as you repeat the spell. You can imagine how it would feel to have a partner. The hugs they will give you, kisses, etc. You can also think about what type of person (personality, religion, etc.) you want to attract.

**While drawing, chant aloud or in your head **

**" The perfect one, will I find, **

**May he sweet, May he kind, **

**Perfect, Special, In body and mind, **

**An it harm none, so mote it be" **

Repeat until you are finished drawing the sigils. 

You should do this at least once a week. This will help it grow stronger. 

Remember, you can not force someone to fall in love with you. But this will help you be more "attractive" and lighten the path to finding a love for you.

** I am unable to edit this spell. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS SPELL WORKS. PLEASE USE TO YOUR DISGRETION. **

* I am unaware if the shared photos of the sigils work. *

I cannot find out how to delete this spell, the sigil links are no longer active.

Since this is a sigil, you can design your own. Love spells do not have to be gender specific. You focus on your ideal partner when casting. Seems plausible, just needs an edit, and you should create you own sigil since sigils are personal.

Unfortunately spells cannot be deleted from this site.

I wasn't aware urls could be used when adding a spell. No? As Lark said spells currently can not be deleted.
