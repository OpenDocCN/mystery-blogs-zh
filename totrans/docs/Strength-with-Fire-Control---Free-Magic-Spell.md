Find a calm and empty place. Light your candle and keep your hands around the flame in a way by which you neither burn your hands nor your hands are to far from it. Empty your mind, calm your senses then focus on the flame. Forget everything and just focus on that flame. Slowly the flame would dim or flicker. This is just a start, the more you practise, the more strong you get at this. And practising this would make you feel stronger or more capable.

If this didn't work then message me.
