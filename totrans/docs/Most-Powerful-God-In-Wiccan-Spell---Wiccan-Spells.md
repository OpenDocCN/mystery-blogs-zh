### Polytheistic Beliefs

Wicca is a polytheistic religion, which means that practitioners believe in multiple deities. Unlike some other religions, Wiccans do not adhere to a strict hierarchy of gods.

These gods are often associated with different aspects of nature, such as the sun, moon, earth, or specific elements like fire or water.

### Personal Connection

Wiccans have the freedom to choose and work with specific gods that resonate with them personally. These deities serve as guides, mentors, and sources of spiritual energy in their magical practices. Some practitioners may connect with deities from ancient pantheons, such as the Greek or Norse gods, while others may prefer to work with gods and goddesses specific to Wicca.

### Invoking Deities in Spellcasting

In Wiccan spellcasting, invoking deities is a common practice. Wiccans believe that by respectfully calling upon a specific god or goddess, they can harness their energy and assistance to manifest their intentions.
