## Casting Instructions for 'Conjuration of the Black Hounds'

 Having abstained for three days from bathing (to protect you from the hounds), with the third new moon; you will be ready to conjure the black hounds. Let it be noted that once this spell is complete the first time, this abstinence will no longer be necessary, the hound will be bound to your service and thus can not harm you so long as you wield the blade.

In a red pigment, and using a brush made of human hair, write these names on one side of a blade: "Cerebus, Fenrir, Gwyllgi" and upon the other side: "te ligo canem nigrum" (I bind you, black hound) Having done this, take a bone and write: "Et regnum mortus vincent"  (may the kingdom of death come forth).

Having consecrated these items with their incantations and nine times having drawn the equal armed cross over the tools, they will be ready for the conjuration. Taking these things; ash of hound, war water and chalk down to a natural portal (being Crossroads, Cemeteries and Mausoleums), you can begin the summoning, but only should the time be between 12 AM and 3 PM, and no sun should be seen.

A circle of nine steps in diameter is drawn upon the floor, and within it they cast the Tridecagon. To the west is drawn a circle of Five steps, and within it a triangle, with a point facing east. On the outer borders of the triangle, the names again. Within the triangle, pour the ash of hound, hydrate it with war water, and animate it with blood (Iron in the blood to further push a mars alignment and to symbolically give life to the hounds).

Retiring back to the Tridecagon, take good care to raise the circle well, so that the hounds do not cause some great harm. Taking up the bone scepter, cry out thirteen times the first conjuration to the east: "I summon, conjure and evoke thee O raging hounds of the underworld, and adjure thee to come quickly, by the names of thy exalted and divine sires, by whom you were conceived in the cold darkness of death and to whom you are bound to serve: Fenrir, Gwyllgi, Cerebus to come forth and manifest thyself, To pact with me and obey my commands!" Set the sceptre down in the middle of the circle, and walk around it thrice clockwise and finishing in the west, facing out.

Say the second conjuration thrice: "I conjure and adjure you, dreadful hounds, by the servitude you owe to the names of your sires, from who's seed you were born in the cold expanses of death with ne'er a tit to suck. Come now savage and starved wolves on thy rotted paws and ancient bones, rise from the ashes and blood of resurrection and up from the gaping maws of the earth."

And when this is done, cross to the east and recites it thrice more. Raise the blade and plunge it into the earth, just beyond the circle and ask: "Would you, O' Cn Annwn, Speak, listen and obey, And swear that They who possess this blade And know thy name, May conjure you up from the gates of death?" And the beast will take the blade by the handle and say: "I swear on this blade My servitude unto you Who knows my name __ And holds this blade If you swear Your essence To nourish me at every call We have a deal" And you must say: "I swear" And the hounds will dissipate. And should you strike the blade into the ground with the scepter as a hammer and call it's name with every strike, so long as the sun has gone, they will come to you.
