Face the dark spirit, concentrate extremely hard. Then, put the Orbem Potentia in front of you and put all of your good energy into the orb. Finally, chant the words ''Cum orbe potestas tene brarum eieci te usque in finem'' with determination and continuously hold it still putting your energy in the Orbem Potentia until the energy stops coming out and the spirit explodes or vaporizes. If this works, congratulations you're the chosen one.
