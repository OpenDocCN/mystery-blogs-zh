# First Date Confidence Charm

How many times have you been asked out on a date? If the answer is not very many, which is probably the case as Wiccans are known to be solitary people, then you probably get nervous during those first dates that you go on, which can cause problems for getting a second date. First date jitters can cause you to stutter over the simplest words, be unable to perform the simplest tasks properly. And make you knock things over. If you are one of those people who literally freeze up in a nerve wracking situation, the awkward silences can be what get you. That is where a confidence charm comes into play. However, any confidence charm could cause issues, as some may cause you to talk too much, to boast a lot, or to become obnoxious almost. So you need one that is geared towards a first date. That is where this charm comes into play. You don't need anything special, as this is just a simple charm. However, if you feel you need a little boost, you can smell some crushed borage to give you a confidence boost on top of the charm. Only for a short second though, because too much will become overbearing. This charm is not permanent, so you want to do it, just before your date, and if the date goes on for more than an hour, then you may want to reapply so to speak. If you are not ready to let your date in on your Wiccan secret, excuse yourself to the restroom, and you can do it in the mirror there.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

 Just before your date, go into your bathroom, or any room with a mirror. If
you have your borage, take three good whiffs of it now. Then look yourself
in the eye in the mirror and say:
" I call upon your forces three.
Let me see the worth of me.
Confidence is what I seek.
I am strong, I am not meek."
Say this three times in the mirror, and then go enjoy your date. If you feel
yourself start to loose confidence, say the charm again in a mirror, doesn't
matter if it is a big mirror or pocket sized mirror. You may want to practice
this a few times before your date as well, that way you are sure that it will
work well, and that you got it right.
