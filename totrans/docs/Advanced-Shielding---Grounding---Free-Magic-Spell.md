# Advanced Shielding & Grounding

  Rated 5/5 Stars

Advanced shielding and grounding. A major help in banishing spells or removing a binding.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Advanced Shielding & Grounding'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**I don't think shielding should be that difficult. You will need a good imagination and visualize what I am going to tell you. I recommend making shields that surround you like a impenetrable bubble. They can be any color you want, be creative. 

I'm not sure how this will work for you but there will be two layers of shielding. The outter layer will simply protect you and prevent any thing from entering, while destroying it with its energy. If something breaks in, the second layer will protect you and will also repeal the energy and bounce it back to whoever sent it. 

Shield your thoughts as well as blocking others from harming or influencing you badly in any way. If you think that as the purpose of your shield, then it will do so. The shield of the mind is created by a strong and happy memory. Think of the happiest moment in your life and imagine your mind and body being strengthened by it and helping you in casting the banishing spell or removing a binding.

When shielding, believe that you are the master of your body, will yourself to do the banishing spell, and know that no outside force can break your defenses or curse you ever again. 

The shielding will take energy from you depending on how effective it is and how much energy you have. So rather than giving energy from yourself, do grounding. Imagine yourself being stabilized and the energy of nature coming to you from below your feet and making you able to stand your ground and strengthen you. This will help you. 

When you finish grounding, thank the nature for helping you.

This requires an edit, but it does work. For those who cannot visualize, think of being safe. This could be a memory, it could even be a scene in a movie. You should charge energy into your body and push it outward to surround you in a protective bubble. You should feel the energy filling your body, and you should have a sense of safety when you shield. You will need to reflect on your shield throughout the day when you begin shielding to reinforce it. As you improve on this daily practice, you will only need to cast once a day.

When shielding, it is helpful to also keep the image you hold simple. For example instead of trying to imagine the details of some form or armor, or layers of shields etc simply recognize yourself as radiant light.

Indeed. It does not have to be elaborate. However, some people lack the ability to visualize a picture. Some simply need practice, but for others their mind simply cannot form picture perfect images no matter how much practice. For them, using a physical picture, a scene from a movie, or reading something that makes them feel safe would work better. It does not have to be the bubble most authors encourage, but as long as they feel the energy, then focus on something safe, it should work.

I agree. This is also when it could also help to have or make some sort of talisman. It could be a personal religious symbol, a charm with significant personal meaning, or even a silver pendant or other representation of an object that represents strength, authority, or safety.

Perhaps a pentagram or cross, or a moon pendant, a dragon or other power-creature, a feather, bullet, anything that speaks to the person and means ''I'm keeping you safe''. ...It isn't ideal to be depending on an external focus (because what if you lose it?) But it is a good place to start while you learn and get better at the practice.
