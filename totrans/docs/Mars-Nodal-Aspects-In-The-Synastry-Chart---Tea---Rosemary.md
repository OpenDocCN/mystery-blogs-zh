> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/mars-nodal-aspects-synastry/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/mars-nodal-aspects-synastry/#0001-01-01)

In the synastry chart, Mars aspects to the North Node indicate that the Mars person is pushing the Nodal person to change and grow. This can be beneficial or difficult, as sometimes Mars is very aggressive.

When Mars aspects the South Node in the synastry chart, this most likely indicates that there is leftover tension from a past life due to a war or fight. This energy will play out again in the current lifetime.

At their best, the North Node person can be an inspiration to the Mars person, helping them to focus and take action in a way that is constructive. Meanwhile, the Mars person can illuminate the North Node person’s path to soul growth and push them to take action in order to get there.

## Mars Conjunct North Node Synastry (Opposition South Node)

If you have the Mars conjunct North North synastry aspect, you also have the Mars opposition South Node aspect. 

The Mars conjunct North Node synastry aspect indicates that there is a strong sense of magnetism in the relationship. You probably had a deep attraction that felt different from other relationships. Sometimes, this attraction can be very sexual with Mars in the mix.

This will be a fated relationship. In fact, the Mars conjunct North Node synastry aspect means that the relationship is karmic and truly meant to be. Regardless of how the relationship ends, both partners will be left with strong feelings from the relationship and will grow and change.

With the Mars conjunct North Node synastry aspect, the Mars person’s drive helps to remind the North Node person of their purpose. The energy of Mars pushes the North Node person to act and change in order to real their ultimate goal. They will also illuminate important life lessons that the North Node person needs to learn in order to do this.

Mars gives determination and courage to the nodal person. They show them what’s wrong with their South Node qualities and what they need to change, and they give the nodal person the inspiration to actually make these changes.

In the beginning, the fire that the Mars person lights can seem fascinating to the North Node person. However, over time, they may balk when they realize that being around the Mars person is a lot of *work*.

Any planet in aspect to the North Node always feels a bit uncomfortable, because the North Node person has to confront the qualities that they currently *lack* over and over. If the North Node person is able to handle this, then the relationship can be really progressive and healing. 

However, Mars can be very pushy with the North Node. After all, Mars is a planet of action! It will take a super evolved North Node person to really make this relationship work, as they will be triggered constantly by the Mars individual.

## Mars Trine North Node Synastry (Sextile South Node)

If you have the Mars trine North North synastry aspect, you most likely also have the Mars sextile South Node aspect, though this isn’t always the case.

When you first meet with the Mars trine North Node synastry aspect, you may feel a strong attraction right away. The North Node person in particular will feel a strong attraction for the Mars individual. 

This relationship seems karmically destined to both people. They each have qualities that the other wishes to emulate and find each other captivating.

In the Mars trine North Node synastry relationship, the Mars person will push the North Node person towards the qualities that they need to achieve. Unlike the conjunction, this will not be too hard; the progress will simply seem natural. The energy doesn’t feel too intense.

Simply being around the Mars person helps the North Node person learn and grow. This Mars trine North Node synastry relationship will also enable the North Node person to see the qualities of their *South Node* that they want to release.

The North Node person can similarly help the Mars person learn how to appropriately channel their energy and direct their drive towards something specific, instead of allowing the energy to scatter.

In the Mars trine North Node synastry relationship, both people motivate each other to take action and challenge the status quo. Depending on other aspects, this can be an easy and beneficial relationship to both parties!

## Mars Sextile North Node Synastry (Trine South Node)

If you have the Mars sextile North North synastry aspect, you most likely also have the Mars trine South Node aspect, though this isn’t always the case.

With the Mars sextile North Node synastry aspect, the Mars person has the *opportunity* to push the North Node person and help them grow. The Mars individual is equipped with the qualities to enhance the North Node person’s soul growth, but they must choose to make this happen.

The Mars person probably won’t know *exactly* how to motivate the North Node person at first. During the relationship, they can really enhance the soul growth of the Nodal person if they choose to take the intiative and ask those hard questions.

However, the Mars sextile North Node synastry aspect doesn’t mean that the Mars person *has* to push the North Node person towards growth. They can choose to ignore the difficult soul and emotional work. If they choose to embrace this aspect, then the relationship can deepen over time.

Being around the Mars person will energize the Nodal person and make them want to change for the better. Again, the Nodal person has to actively *try* to learn and change, as this Mars sextile North Node synastry aspect isn’t totally natural.

The Mars person must be careful that they push the Nodal person towards growth without overpowering them or trying to enforce their own will. The Mars individual must help the Nodal person heal from past life trauma and move forward without casting judgment on the situation.

Meanwhile, the North Node person can show the Mars person how to effectively channel their energy and make things happen.

## Mars Opposition North Node Synastry (Conjunct South Node)

If you have the Mars opposition North North synastry aspect, you also have the Mars conjunct South Node synastry aspect. 

With Mars conjunct South Node in synastry, the couple feels an intense pull right away. The physical chemistry is especially strong and may even be animalistic. 

If an instant physical attraction exists, this indicates that the couple are sexual partners from a past life. They will recognize each other on an energetic level when they first meet.

Alternatively, the Mars conjunct South Node synastry aspect can indicate that the couple was either competitions or partners in battle during a past life.

In either scenario, the South Node person usually *gave* a lot to the Mars person during that past life. The Mars person probably took more than their share, or they were violent or abusive towards the South Node person. In some way, there is an unhealed wound, even if there is a lot of chemistry, too.

Residual anger tends to pop up with the Mars conjunct South Node synastry aspect. Usually, the South Node person feels oppressed around Mars, even if there’s no logical reason for these emotions. The Mars person might feel like the South Node person wants payback when they haven’t done anything.

How the Mars conjunct South Node synastry relationship progresses will depend on the evolvement and emotional intelligence of both partners. Mars can be quite supportive of the South Node person and can push them to evolve towards the North Node, or they can fall back into those old patterns of violence, abuse, competition, or anger.

Meanwhile, the South Node person can be incredibly attracted to the Mars person and can learn to forgive past hurts. However, if the South Node person isn’t *ready* to do this emotional work, then they may be passive aggressive or even aggressive towards Mars. In some cases, the abuse can flip in this lifetime, with the Nodal person acting as the perpetrator and the Mars individual playing the victim.

If you have the Mars conjunct South Node synastry aspect, it’s important that you learn to coexist without a strong sense of competition. In this relationship, competition will be your downfall. Work together instead of taking offense and attacking each other over perceived slights.

The Mars person must allow the Nodal person to grow and change, while the Nodal person must learn to see Mars for who they truly are, not just to look at what Mars can do for/against them.

The Mars opposition North Node synastry aspect can certainly work in any relationship, but it will take a lot of effort from both parties to heal the wounds of the past. 

In order to learn more about the specific wounds of this past life, look at the house and sign that the Mars conjunct South Node synastry aspect sits in.

## Mars Square North Node Synastry (Square South Node)

If you have the Mars square North North synastry aspect, you most likely also have the Mars square South Node aspect, though this isn’t always the case.

The Mars square North Node synastry aspect means that the couple knew each other in a past life, but they skipped the issues that they were supposed to address. In this life, they will be forced to address the problems between them in a more harsh and constant way.

When the Mars square North Node synastry couple first meets, they may feel intrigued by each other. They want to know more about each other, but there is also a rough energy between them and a sense of friction. This is usually what creates the attraction.

The couple perpetuated a war between them in a past life, and this energy still exists now. The relationship can be filled with power struggles, aggression, and anger.

Sometimes, Mars square North Node means that the couple is always competing against each other instead of being on the same side. They may try to one-up each other, win fights, or control each other. This dynamic simply feels natural because of the energy between them from their past life.

However, the Mars square North Node synastry relationship can block the couple from evolving if they can’t work through their issues. They may feel like they are triggered by the other person over and over, and that it’s impossible to truly make peace.

The way that the Mars person exerts their energy triggers the Nodal person, because it reminds them of how that energy was directed *against* them in this past life. In fact, the Mars person will trigger emotion issues as well as issues relating to the Nodal person’s sense of self.

Meanwhile, the Nodal person can feel held back from reaching their soul’s purpose. Something about this relationship makes them feel that they can never evolve around the Mars person.

Over time, the Mars person may want to impress the Nodal person or somehow work things out, but their efforts are in vain. Typically, the Mars person fails to see what the Nodal person really needs to evolve, so they give them all of the wrong things. For example, Mars may buy the Nodal person gifts instead of attempting to connect emotionally.

The Mars conjunct North Node synastry relationship *can* work if both people are willing to put the effort in. The Mars person must learn how to focus on themselves and build their own self-confidence without resorting to aggressive, competition, or games. They must stop trying to win the love of the Nodal person and start to realize that the Nodal person must *choose* to love them.

Meanwhile, the Nodal person must let go of their need to win against the Mars person. They are usually the ones who “lost” to Mars in a past lifetime, so now they may be obsessed with winning to try and even the scales. Over time, they will realize that this game of competition doesn’t truly change the energy.

The Nodal person must learn how to win for themselves, not *against* someone else. They must forgive their partner for past hurts and learn how to be on the same side as a couple.

Ultimately, the Mars square North Node synastry aspect means that there is an issue of competition in the relationship. The couple must learn to compete against themselves to be a better version of their soul, and to be united as a couple.
