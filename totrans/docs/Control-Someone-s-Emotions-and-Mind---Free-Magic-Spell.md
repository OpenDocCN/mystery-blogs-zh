# Control Someone's Emotions and Mind

Take over someones thoughts and feelings easily. But with a price. It works best with a Negative intent.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Control Someone's Emotions and Mind'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your Blood.

*   A animal such as a Snake, Spider, Scorpion, Centipede.

*   A victim.

*   A knife.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your Blood.

*   A animal such as a Snake, Spider, Scorpion, Centipede.

*   A victim.

*   A knife.

 This spell will cost you. You will need to cut yourself with a knife that is clean. Let your blood poor into any container or bowl you have, on the stroke of midnight. Now let that pool of blood sit while you make your cost, in order for everything to work. Take any of the animals you choose and take The eyes out from the snake, if you chose the spider take The body without the its head, if you chose the scorpion take its legs off, and if you chose the Centipede take off its front and back antennas.

Now you either, swallow the eyes of the Snake, or the body of the Spider, the legs of the Scorpion, and last it would be that you would swallow the antennas of the Centipede. This may give you a stronger connection to these animals, or they may change you into a monster.. But the MOST important part. Taking over the person.. You will have to get them to consume the blood of yours raw

Putting it in hot tea is an exception. When they have Finished consuming your blood..you wait. You wait until the EXACT next stroke of midnight, and chant " Let my soul, DNA mix, and merge with the Animal I have chosen to protect and change my soul. Make me stronger and make anything that has had a taste of my blood to bow against a will they no longer have."

Now wait once again. The person will start acting off. That's good. It means the blood is surging still within them changing their own body, and bending their own wills to feel. You have made them bind to you, gave a spiritual cost that may protect your soul or change it, and you are now a Puppeteer.

I feel I could die or this could work, but I do not want to test it to find out.

This is fake. You cannot control anothers emotions. While some believe in telepathy, it would be a skill you would practice, not by cutting yourself and eating snake eyes. The procedure is wrong. While using a drop of blood or animal parts in a spell are real in certain paths, how this spell describes the process is not how you work with animal parts. Not to mention tricking someone into consuming your blood is unhealthy, immoral and I think could be a legal issue. Overall fake and potentially dangerous.
