  Rated 5/5 Stars

Something I came up with after meditation...

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Smooth stone

*   Bundle of small twigs

*   glue

*   Feathers

*   Seashell

*   hemp

*   Wand

*   Sage/Sandalwood incense

*   Voice

*   5 white candles

*   Blessed/Holy water

*   Cotton filled bowl

*   Mint Leaves

*   matches, lighter, etc..

## Casting Instructions for 'How to Make a Protective Amulet'

Find a smooth stone and a bundle of thin twigs. Pierce a hole through the stone, and glue the sticks onto it in the shape of a pentacle. Then, find a sea shell and three feathers. Like the stone, create a small hole at the top of the seashell. String these onto a hemp cord, or something natural. You can attach the feathers to the back of the seashell to ensure that they do not disappear. Then cast a protective circle around you and the amulet and burn sage or sage incense to clear the air. Sandalwood incense works as well.
Point your wand at the amulet. Repeat these words three times,

''Oh mighty earth,
Protect me as your child.
Oh soaring wind,
I summon thee to my trials.

Through the two,
I'll become
Safe within their arms.
None shall cross
the circles I've wrought
To do me harm.

Oh crashing water,
Save me from the slaughter!
Oh flaming fire,
I am the Sun's sweet daughter.

Through the two,
I'll become
safe within their arms.
None shall cross
The circles I've wrought
To do me harm.

By three above
And none below,
I protect this,
Demons woe.''

This should keep evil spirits and evil mortals away from you or the object you place this around. To banish evil away before you bind this to you, of even before you protect the Amulet, do this:
Cast a circle, and burn five white candles in the shape of a pentacle. In the center of the circle, burn either Sage, of Sandalwood incense. Sprinkle holy water in the corners of the room, as well as down, the drains of the room. Put a bowl of cotton in the center of the room. Point towards this while you chant.
Place Mint leaves around yourself, and say,

''I banish thee Evil ones,
Hearts so corrupt and rotten.

Never come here again,
I send thee to the cotton.

Dispose of your horrid ways,
And then perhaps you can stay.

But until Your true conversion,
This spell shall only slay.

Demons be wary
in this sacred space,

I have many friends here,
With Love and grace.''

Now, take the bowl of cotton outside, and burn it safely. This will banish the evil caught inside.

Now to bind the Amulet to you,
THIS HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF YOUR BIRTHDAY.
Place the Amulet with something you sleep with, something you eat, and a picture of yourself. Point your wand at the Amulet and say,

''Like me, you're an (Ares, leo, cancer..etc...)
(Something about your sign: leo: Bright as the sun)
You hold my spirit,
Magic as one.
Without me you'll end,
together we'll rise.
The bubbles will brood,
Unclouding our eyes.
With love and trust,
I bind thee to me,
And as I will,
So mote it be!''
