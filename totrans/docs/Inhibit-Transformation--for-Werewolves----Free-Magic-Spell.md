 Hold the gem and chant facing the sun:

"Wolves of the Elements, I call your might
I will transform within the night
As the full moon will be shining bright
But I must keep my form from human sight
Let the moon touch my skin
Without awakening the beast within
I need to hold my (animal) form in
But my magical strength is thin
Allow me to resist the primal light
That changes werebeasts in the night
As I have things to do tonight
Where my form may come under human sight.
Hide the moon away from me
I do not want humans to see
Just for one night, seal the (animal) in me
This is my will, so mote it be!"

(You can replace 'wolves of the element's with your god/dess)

Physical transformation is not real. Real Magic does not defy nature. This does not work.
