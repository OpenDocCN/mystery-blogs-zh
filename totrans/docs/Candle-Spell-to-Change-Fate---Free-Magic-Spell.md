**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A special candle

*   A pentacle with corresponding symbols

 Set up altar with the four candles in each corner, and in the center put the pentacle and the
wishing candle over it. Wait to do the spell until the full moon, and then make sure you do it
at night and where the stars are in full view.

On the new moon, look unto the sky for the 7 brightest stars. Hold up a lighter and say/chant: "I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish this night. For change of ______ this night I ask, and by the flame, I ask it last. Seven brightest stars in the sky, light the flame I hold high."

With this light your lighter, light the wishing candle, and light the little candles in it's flame.
Now go about business as usual.

This may set intention and help you create change in your life, but without putting in the effort to achieve the goal, this will not work. We can wake up any day and choose to change. It is the daily work that this spell will help us with.
