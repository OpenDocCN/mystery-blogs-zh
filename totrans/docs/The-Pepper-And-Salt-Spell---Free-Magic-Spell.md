**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A salt shaker

*   A pepper shaker

*   One metre of pink ribbon

As you consecrate the objects think of one of the condiments as being masculine and the other as feminine. Then tie the female object to one end of the ribbon and the male one to the other end. As you are doing this say:
''Ribbon of love, as I bind thee
Please let true love find me.
And it harm none, so be it.''
The next morning, untie the salt and pepper, then retie them a little closer to each other, repeating the incantation. Do this each day for seven days, timing it so that by the seventh day the two are touching. Now bind them together, repeat the incantation and leave them until the night of the full Moon by which time either someone should have entered your life, or someone you already know will have you in their thoughts. They may not declare themselves right away, but they will eventually.
