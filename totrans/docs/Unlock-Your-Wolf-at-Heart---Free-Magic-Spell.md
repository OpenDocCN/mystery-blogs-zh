You are human. If you wish to use this or a similar ritual to connect with spirits, or go on a spiritual journey, it might serve to gain enlightenment on your path. If you are expecting to say this and have a wolf spirit you can change into at will, it will not happen, Real Magic does not work that way.

Then how does real magick work?

Real Magic is a neutral energy found in nature that brings natural change. On the physical plane, it is ruled by nature, and does not contradict it. Spells focus this energy, charge it with our intentions, and set it on a desired path. If this change is unnatural, it will not work. If you are interested in working with wolves, research animal spirits and totems as well as the culture and religion this concept comes from. Research deities associated with wolves, perhaps even astral projection as it is believed they are astral spirits similar to fairys who can help on your path. As far as what you saw in movies; flying brooms, physical transformation, sparks flying out of wands, none of that is real.

you dont need a spell to ''unlock'' your wolf side. Check out being a therian instead, because its quite similar. You dont need magic to embrace who you are.
