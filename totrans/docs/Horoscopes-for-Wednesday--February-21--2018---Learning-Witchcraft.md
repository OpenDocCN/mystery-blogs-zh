## Is Today Your Birthday?

Venus, planet of personal love, joins forces with Neptune, planet of universal love, on your birthday, so the focus of the next 12 months will be on breaking down barriers and building bridges to people in all walks of life. Be a force for good in the world.

### AQUARIUS

Open your heart to those who are trying to reach out to you. Let them know that you share their feelings. You don’t need fame or fortune to light up your life, you need people around you who love you for what you are, and always will.

### PISCES

What is your number one passion? That is what you should be working on. With so much cosmic activity in your sign you have every right and reason to believe that your dreams will come true – but you’ve got to go after them with conscious intent.

### ARIES

You don’t need to pay attention to what other people say you should be doing. The more they try to tell you that you are on the wrong track today the more certain you can be that you are doing everything right. So keep doing it.

### TAURUS

Your life is governed by a cosmic plan and if you listen to what your inner voice tells you and align yourself with that plan you will find both emotional happiness and material success in the days ahead. Never doubt what comes from the heart.

### GEMINI

Someone in a position of power has become a bit of a role model for you of late but don’t fall into the trap of thinking they can do no wrong. Everyone is human, no matter how successful they may be, and humans always make mistakes.

### CANCER

It’s time to get involved again with something you put on the back burner a few months ago. Let your sense of adventure guide you and don’t listen to those who urge caution. You don’t need caution Cancer, you need action, and plenty of it!

### LEO

You know that someone is keeping things from you but you can’t work out what they are. According to the planets they are deliberately being vague and obstructive because they know it annoys you. Maybe you should act as if you don’t care.

### VIRGO

You seem to be flavor of the month with just about everyone at the moment and that’s nice, but don’t take other people’s regard for you for granted. As with all relationships, romantic and platonic, you need to bring something to the feast too.

### LIBRA

You cannot escape your problems by retreating into your shell or focusing exclusively on your work. A relationship issue of some sort demands to be dealt with today, because if you keep ignoring it then it could easily become a fixture in your life.

### SCORPIO

Try to avoid getting too emotional. You may have good reason to believe that you have been betrayed but if you let your feelings guide you there will be no going back. There is still time to resolve the situation without resorting to confrontation.

### SAGITTARIUS

If a friend or family member tries to dissuade you from taking a certain course of action you would be wise to listen to what they say. You may still decide to push ahead but at least you will do so knowing what obstacles lie ahead.

### CAPRICORN

Travel and social activities are under excellent stars, so you can expect some pleasant trips and encounters over the next few days. You can also expect to have your mind broadened in ways you did not know were possible. It’s never too late to learn.
