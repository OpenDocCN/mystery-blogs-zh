Let I become a demon after my life"

Do not cut yourself. Even if this spell worked, which it does not, you do not need to cut yourself to get a pool of blood. You could get an infection. Take a sterile needle, prick your finger, use a few drops. Those few drops have more than enough power in them. You do not need to sign your name in blood. Furthermore, nobody knows for certain what happens after death, but if reincarnation is real, the majority of people belief you do not get much, if any, of a say in where/when/what you are reincarnated as. Perhaps you are reborn as a demon, or maybe your actions in this life result in you coming back as a newt. Once you cross the veil, then things will become clear. Until then, you cannot determine what your next life will become.
