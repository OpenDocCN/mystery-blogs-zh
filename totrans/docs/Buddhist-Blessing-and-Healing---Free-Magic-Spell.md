# Buddhist Blessing and Healing

This is a spell (actually more of a prayer) that is used for blessing or healing. It can be used on yourself or on others.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Buddhist Blessing and Healing'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 white candle

*   1 red candle

*   1 light blue candle

*   Incense (any)

*   Buddhist statue(recommended)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 white candle

*   1 red candle

*   1 light blue candle

*   Incense (any)

*   Buddhist statue(recommended)

 First, you have to have a clear area (clutter free). If you are using the ingredients, have the statue on a raised platform (table) and place the candles around it; white in front, red to the left, and light blue to the right. Then place the incense in front of the white candle. Just before you start the prayer/spell, light the candles from left to right, lighting the incense last.
If you are not using the ingredients, just do this next part here:

"Just as the soft rains fill the streams, pour into the rivers and join together in the oceans, so may the power of every moment of your goodness flow forth to awaken and heal all beings, those here now, those gone before, those yet to come."

"By the power of every moment of your goodness... May your heart's wishes be soon fulfilled, as completely shining as the bright full moon, as magically as by a wish-fulfilling gem. May all dangers be averted and all disease be gone."

It may take a while to take effect, but afterwards you should feel good and light. Im sorry if it doesn't work for you, but if it does, mail me the results.
