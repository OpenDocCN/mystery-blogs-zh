 You need to repeat this 7 times to work, this is very very powerful and it will bring season of rain and thunderstorms

You need to fast for 7 days, and cleanse yourself from all sinful doings then:

Make tall tube out of raw clay, fill it with bronze and iron shavings and wild pansy, around it build big campfire with oak wood on it, around the campfire, 5 meters away put 8 big stones, and on them 8 strong magnets.

When you set everything take two long but very thin wooden sticks that are bendable, face north light that campfire, then turn in a way you can walk between campfire and magnetic rocks in circles with your hands spread, holding those two thin sticks, one touching edge of campfire other those eight rocks as you pass and gently caress them. 

Make 7 counter clockwise circles and recite this for 7 times: "Yillen goselet beithir béim" (on gaelic it means rain showers, lightning strikes, its not magical mantra, its just that old languages are more in tune with nature, specially ones whose cultures lived by natures laws)

When you re done chanting and walking in circles, watch the campfire, **and most importantly make everything safe for yourself and your surroundings**, then most important thing to do is to burn those two sticks as a last fire! if you fail to do it, then no rain season for you.
