*   A bowl of water

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Alot of Sand

*   One long red candle

*   A bowl of water

First, find out if you are really cursed or just having a bad day/week.

Fill half your bowl with sand, and the other half with water. Take your candle and set it in the bowl to the bottom of the sand.

Before you go to bed set it on a nightstand or a table near your bed and stand over it. Make sure it is night. Light the candle and focus on the candle being your curse. When focused, speak:

A-kahn-a-la. Shook-oh-leh-me.
Yaa too High
Yaa too High
Yaa too High!

Go to sleep. When the candle dies' down enough it will hit the water and go out, letting that curse die with it.
