You do not need a spell to become ''more dark and twisted.'' Good and evil are moral choices, not a switch. Someone is not all good or all evil, it is about choice. Simply act in accordance with your morals and base them in opposition to the morals of society. You choose how to act. Others may influence you, but ultimately, you are responsible for your actions. It is nice to know now why you posted so many fake spells on the site Becca, you are evil! *thunder crashes in distance*
