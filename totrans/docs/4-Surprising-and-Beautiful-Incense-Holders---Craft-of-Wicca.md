Incense holders are things we often don’t think about. You probably have some uninspired slab of wood for your own.

 You know me. I love to make my own stuff. Most of the expensive products out there are not worth it. If you’re interested in making your own incense from kitchen scraps, I wrote a [DIY Wicca article](https://craftofwicca.com/diy-wicca-making-incense/) on it.

Still, every now and again I like to splurge and get something that will be truly beautiful and unique for my altar. This article will show you four surprising and beautiful incense holders that you may want to consider adding to your home.

 ## Frequently Asked Questions about Incense Holders

Before getting into the recommendations, let’s cover some of the common questions people have.

### What are incense holders called?

In the catholic tradition, incense holders are called **censers** or **thuribles**. This usually only refers to a holder that is an enclosed vessel dangling from a chain in which loose incense is burned on coals.

 In most cases, especially in Wicca, we just refer to them as incense holders.

 ### What kind of incense holder is best?

The best incense holder will depend on what you want to use it for. Stick, loose, and cone incense will each have a different type of holder that is best.

 When using a stick, any type that keeps the stick off the ground will work. Usually, you will want something open rather than enclosed for stick incense.

For cone incense, any holder that cannot catch on fire will work. Since cone incense is similar to stick, it is also common to have an open container as these burn slowly and regularly.

 For loose incense, you will want a material that can withstand high heat. It is common to use a brass holder, but glass or ceramic works well too. Loose incense is usually burned in an enclosed container because it emits more smoke.

 ### What are the holes in an incense box for?

The holes in an incense box are there simply to let out the aroma from the burning incense inside. The holes on the bottom of an incense holder are there to hold solid sticks of incense. There are sometimes multiple holes because people like to burn more than one stick at a time.

### Do you close the incense box?

If there is a lid, then yes, close the box! The scent will come out of the holes. If there are no holes, then you should not close the box. Not only will this trap the scent inside, but the box will fill with carbon dioxide and snuff out the burning incense.

 ## Recommended Incense Holders

### 1\. Ceramic Backflow Incense Holder Incense Burner Waterfall

If there’s one thing we know about incense, it’s that the smoke goes up as it burns.

 ***Or do we?***

This ceramic incense holder is known as a “backflow” incense holder. This means that the smoke flows in reverse through it.

 The backflow incense holder is a ceramic incense holder that is designed to prevent incense from spilling out of the holder.

The holder has a small hole in the top that allows the incense to flow out, but prevents it from flowing back in. This design is often used in Buddhist ceremonies, as it is believed to help keep the space clean and free from negative energy.

 This beautiful incense holder is elegant painted ceramic. It will both wow guests and enhance any private use: on an altar, the kitchen counter, or even at an outdoor ritual.

 The incense cone sits on at the top of it and as the smoke flows down, it gives the appearance of a flowing river down a mountain.

It is my top pick for a surprising and beautiful incense holder to add to your collection.

 ### 2\. Incense Smoke Waterfall

I’ll continue with the water theme because I find them so perfect when done well.

Here is another backflow incense holder that gives the impression of a waterfall through a quaint setting, complete with boat, bridge, and viewing gazebo.

The craftsmanship is excellent, though it is made of resin instead of ceramic, so it can come across as slightly cheaper than the mountain river holder above.

 It is a beautiful way to enjoy your favorite incense fragrance. This type of holder creates a waterfall of incense smoke that cascades down into a basin below. The smoke pools at the bottom, creating a fragrant atmosphere in your home.

 Remember, though, that backflow designs need a special incense cone that allows the smoke to flow at the bottom instead of the top.

 ### 3\. Lotus Incense Holder

Maybe you don’t want to deal with getting special backflow incense cones. Let’s move on to simple yet effective incense holders.

 I love this lotus holder because it looks exactly like the things I’d be putting on my altar anyway.

 It is simple and elegant and holds any incense stick. The intricate design is a wonderful addition to any room. The lotus flower is a symbol of purity and peace.

 I’d recommend this [lotus incense holder](https://amzn.to/317tLm2) for anyone not ready to take the plunge on a backflow holder or if you just want something *simple* and beautiful.

 It’s surprising because when people ask what it is when not in use and you tell them it’s an incense holder, they’ll say: *no way!*

 ### 4\. Ceramic Bowl Holder

This type of ceramic bowl holder is about as classic a holder as you can get, but it is still great.

 I just love the blue on this one with the ornamentation on the top. They come in a wide variety of colors.

 This will definitely go well in any situation, and the fact that it is so unobtrusive makes it perfect for professional settings.

 I like to use this one for tarot readings so that there are no other nearby objects distracting me or the person I’m reading for.

 Another reason this stands out is that it works with every type of incense imaginable: cones, sticks, coils, and even loose!

 It’s so rare to find incense holders that can work with loose incense.

Ceramic bowl incense holders are a beautiful way to add a touch of elegance to any room. They come in a variety of colors and designs and can be used to hold any type of incense. They are also a great way to display your incense collection.

 ## Final Thoughts

If you’re into experimenting with clever backflow designs, my top choice is the first listed incense holder here. For everyone else, one of the simple and beautiful other designs can also spruce up any space that uses incense.

 You could even consider these as gifts!

 Different people enjoy different things, so it makes sense that incense holders would be a popular gift. Whether someone enjoys the unique smell of jasmine or the calming effect of lavender, there is sure to be a holder that appeals to them.

 Plus, these holders make great additions to any room – they can be used to scent a whole room or just one specific area. So if you’re looking for a unique gift idea, consider giving an incense holder!
