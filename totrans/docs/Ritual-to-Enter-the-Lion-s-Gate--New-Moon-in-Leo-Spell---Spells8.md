### What is a Lion‚Äôs Gate portal?

A Lion‚Äôs Gate portal is an astrological phenomenon where 3 important celestial events take place:

1.  The star **Sirius** rises in the sky and becomes visible to us; üåü
2.  The **Sun** is in its home sign of **Leo**;
3.  The numerological significance of **8/8**.

**Sirius is the brightest star in the sky** and has been important to humanity since ancient Egypt, when it was equated to [**Goddess Isis**](https://spells8.com/lessons/isis-goddess-worship/), symbol of fertility.

The **Lion** was significant to ancient Egyptians who associated it with **the sun and the pharaoh**, the most powerful elements of life and death in ancient Egypt.

The **Number 8** is the number of infinity (the reason we included it in the name of our [website](https://spells8.com/about-us/)!), symbolizing the [8 lunar phases](https://spells8.com/lessons/moon-phases-spells/), the [8 Wiccan sabbats](https://spells8.com/magic/sabbats/), and all endless cycles.

Collectively these factors are about to vibrate together in a highly specific way to produce an especially lucky and fortunate day out of the year. By practicing a Lion‚Äôs Gate ritual, you are aligning yourself with the energetic potency of this day of expansive opportunities.
