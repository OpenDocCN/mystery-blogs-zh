 The undead (anything from a skeleton to a 1 hour old corpse) requires no direct link to the master after it is created. All you need is a quick but powerful burst of power directed by your words, and if you are powerful enough, you can raise several slaves. It is recommended that you have done several power gaining rituals if you plan to keep the slave long-term, as it will decay if you do not rejuvenate it's flesh (does not concern skeleton.)

Raise your hands above the corpses head and chest and say loudly:" licentia mihi vox , quod operor meus bidding huic vultus!"

And in 2-3 days it shall be up and about! If it does not work you are not powerful enough, it took my teacher over 300 years to gain such power.

You cannot bring someone back from the dead to be your undead slave. Furthermore, the persons ''teacher'' cannot be 300 years old since humans are mortal and cannot live that long. This entire thing is ridiculous and pure fantasy.

Couldnt the teacher have been a deity?

In regards to this spell, no. Deities are not dead, and you cannot revive them with a spell. A deity can help you on your path, but that is not how you work with them. You do not summon them, revive them, or cast a spell on them.
