 First things first, make sure you have everything set up in their room first. Night light should be plugged in at this point.

Now make sure they have a full stomach, and then run their bath water and put in three drops of Johnson and Johnson Bedtime Baby wash. Wash them up so they begin to get sleepy.

Next get them out and dry them off, and wrap them in their towel. Now rub them down with the Baby lotion, and get them dressed and lay them in bed.

Get your IPhone/IPod/IPad Tablet etc. Go to YouTube and type in 24 hours of Meditation music for children or you can even use 24 hours of Disney Piano Music.

Hook up the speaker and put it somewhere high enough so that they can still hear it.

i fail to see how this is a ''spell'' more ''good advice for a new parent'' you might wish to sing a lullaby but have the words be infused with your energy similar to a chant to wish the child a peaceful, long nights rest.

I wanna take it as more of like a joke- ''haha look it works like magic'' because I mean- sometimes it takes a miracle to chill a kid out

''Chill a kid out'' what are you talking about? This is a site for spells and magick and while mundane effort is important, this was promoted as a spell because it's posted in the spell category and called a ''spell'' in the title. I was explaining how it could work. Infusing a lullaby is one method of turning something mundane into a spell.

...I feel like this is some kind of joke or something. Well, the only magick inside is the magick of laughter. But still, pretty good advice.
