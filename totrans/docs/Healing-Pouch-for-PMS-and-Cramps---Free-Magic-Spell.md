# Healing Pouch for PMS and Cramps

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This a healing spell I made. It worked so well for me that I'd like to share it with you! It's a PMS and cramp healing pouch.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Healing Pouch for PMS and Cramps'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A small pouch

*   A pinch of lavender

*   A hematite gemstone

*   A white ribbon tied in a loop (for purity, and to allow healing energy to flow, but not stray)

*   A pen and a piece of paper

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A pinch of lavender

*   A hematite gemstone

*   A white ribbon tied in a loop (for purity, and to allow healing energy to flow, but not stray)

*   A pen and a piece of paper

First you must think about exactly what it is you wish to heal. Write it down using only positive language - so for instance, instead of writing ''I don't want to have period cramps'' write ''I want to be free of period cramps''.

Take the first letter of each word, removing any repeated letters (e.g. IWTBFOPC) and write them down on a small slip of paper. Fold this slip three times to symbolize healing-three-fold and place it, along with the ribbon, the lavender, and the hematite, into the pouch. Carry the pouch around with you until the end of your period and then dismantle it, giving the slip back to the earth, and keeping the other items for use in further spell work.
