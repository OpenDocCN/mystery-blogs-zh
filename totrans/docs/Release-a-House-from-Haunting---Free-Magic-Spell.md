**You will need the following items for this spell:**

 Focus on your will and chant the following:

"The presence that stands upon the stairs, the unseen hands that move the chairs, the lights that play across the wall, the stains that stay and plates that fall. The mist, the chill, the wandering scents. This gentle spell removes them hence.

Set a table neat, with cup and plate, and wine and meat. Invite the ghost to sit and feast, as any host should urge a guest. Presently, clear the meal away. Then open the door and softly say:

"Quick or dead, thou art fed. Cease to grieve and take thy leave"
