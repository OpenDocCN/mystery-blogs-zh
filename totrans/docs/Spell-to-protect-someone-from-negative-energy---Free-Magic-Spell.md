 Go into a quiet room. Make sure there are absolutely NO distractions at all. Turn off the lights. Sit in a spot on the floor and prop a pillow up against your back. Rest your hands on your knees and meditate. (for 2 mins.) Then close your eyes while picturing the person you want/need to protect. Now picture yourself helping them up from the ground in which they've fallen. Picture you taking them back home. Open you're eyes and say this spell 2x: In which is in desperate need ______ (their name) shall be protected by me. I cast this spell to make the things go away. Vanish. They no longer need to fear the other side of this road. Because it ends here. I am the one to protect thy, therefore SO MOTE IT BE! Soon enough it should work, have faith in the power within you. Believe you CAN do it because you really can.
