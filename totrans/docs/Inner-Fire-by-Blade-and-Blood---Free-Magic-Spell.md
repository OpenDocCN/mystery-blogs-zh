*   1 red candle

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 pentagram

*   1 pentacle

*   1 red candle

*   1 black candle

*   1 white candle

*   1 brown candle

*   1 other candle of a color of your own choosing

*   Your own blood

*   Silver blade

 To start things off, draw your pentagram on any suitable material. Next, draw your pentacle and something and place that in your pocket. Then place in order from left to right- the candles, the candle that you picked should end up at the lowest point of the pentagram. Next, cut yourself on the hand (or bicep) of the arm that you write with with the silver blade and let the blood drip from that hand onto the center of the pentagram. Then light the candles until some of the wax from each of the candles drip onto the pentagram.

After each of candles drip wax onto the pentagram, extinguish the candles. Leave every object involved in the spell-casting in their place until five moons have passed and then stand by the pentagrams and candles and chant the following incantation,"Sir Azazel, grant me the energy of one of your brethren so I may walk the path of shadows and keep both light and darkness in my mind, aura, and soul."

Once this is done, meditate under the largest tree that you can find underneath a body of water. If you are in the city, go to the most private secluded area (preferably near water and or trees) and concentrate in your mind the powers and abilities that you want to gain. Only do this for three hours. Keep a timer on yourself, no more certainly no less than the timed mentioned above.
