# Blood Wish Potion (OUTDATED)

I highly recommend you do not use this wish potion for things like people to get hexed or hurt, it's really likely to backfire and the outcome will land on you. Oh and most importantly... Be careful what you wish for. The effects of this ritual are permanent and can't be reversed.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Blood Wish Potion (OUTDATED)'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Moon Phases: for new beginnings use New Moon, use waning stage to get rid of something, use waxing stage to draw something to you~

*   Honey~ squeeze about 2 teaspoons to sweeten the outcome of the spell (if you're wishing for a lot)

*   1 drop of your blood~ (don't use menstrual blood, it's used in only love potions/spells)

*   Water~one or two spoonfuls should be enough

*   A mortar and a pestle~ to mix the contents together

*   Belief~an important component that bounds the potion together

 I suggest you clean your whole body, meditate for calmness, and ask your deity to bless the ritual to work.. Step 1: gather your ingredients Step 2: add water, honey and mix the components together clockwise Step 3: after doing mixing, take your hands around the mortar and draw energy from yourself (only good and positive energy) and bring it into the mixture. You may think about what you want Step 4: while bringing energy, say the following incantation ~Wishes all And wishes one What I ask for May it be done All I wish for May it please come true Here is an offering just for you~ Step 5: quickly add a drop of blood to the potion and mix it while still thinking about your wish Step 6: after done mixing, drink all of the potion quickly as if the blood will become toxic as your wish will become toxic as well. -Depending on what you wished for it can come true in either hours, days, weeks, or even maybe years... just be patient- If you attempt this ritual, email me your results~

what if you don't own a mortar and pestle?

Find another tool to mix with, as long its all mixed together well you should be good.

Can this be used more than once?

This doesnt work you cant change your appearance with magic

@jeffrey: make a new one with each spell. @black and Darkling: yes and no. you cannot say a chant and wake up a model, but you can say a chant, the energy shifts, and you have an easier time sticking to and achieving your goal.

i'm confused as to the nature of this, is it a blessing or curse? i can't tell, if it's a positive spell why bring up the blood making the potion toxic, if it's a curse the ingredients don't work with the intended energy. if it works for you i'm happy, but this whole thing seems flawed to me.

This spell is a bit wonky as I have made it during a phase of mine ! not bad for you to think of it as flawed but it has worked, I may need to change a few things though lol

With a bit of tweaking I could see this working for some cases, but the blood is a dangerous addition. Drinking blood is never a good idea, even just a drop of it. A drop wouldn't kill you or anything, but it could make someone sick, and if someone cast the spell often it could quickly become dangerous.

I honestly get it ! And thanks for the comment because idk what i was thinking with the blood tbh

Yes, I'm certainly passing no judgement on the blood, as I did similar things when I was younger lol, and because you seem receptive and understanding about criticism, which is great. I just wanted to point it out in case someone younger came along and thought it would be a good idea to drink a bunch of blood for a spell. I think the blood could certainly be helpful in connecting the wish to oneself as long as drinking it wasn't involved lol.
