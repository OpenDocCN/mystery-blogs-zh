# Refrigerator Binding Free weight loss

A symbolic binding (since you can't really tie your fridge closed) to help you improve your willpower and reduce snacking.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Refrigerator Binding Free weight loss'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your supplies for this free weight loss spell are:

*   A piece of black yarn, a few feet long

*   Black candle

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your supplies for this free weight loss spell are:

*   A piece of black yarn, a few feet long

*   Black candle

 Light the black candle while you concentrate on improving your willpower and motivation to lose weight. Think about that while you tie knots in the yarn, about every 4 to 5 inches along the length.

Once it's knotted, take the yarn to your refrigerator and wrap it around the door handle several times and knot it tightly. While you do this, repeat the following:

> I bind you cravings, to stay away
> I bind you cravings, to stay away
> I bind you cravings, to stay away
> I am stronger than you today

Leave the candle somewhere safe to burn out. Then every time to go to the fridge, let the yarn remind you of your goal. If you find you tend to snack from the cupboard, you can cast this spell with a cupboard door instead.

This seems plausible, but I would leave the knots in the freezer because the point is to freeze the habit. Removing it from the freezer could have the opposite effect. Another option is to bury the chord as the knots have bound the cravings. On top of the spell, remove any unhealthy foods from your house if possible. If your family is unsupportive or insist on keeping treats, place them in one cupboard and draw a sigil on the door so the cupboard is ''invisible'' to you.
