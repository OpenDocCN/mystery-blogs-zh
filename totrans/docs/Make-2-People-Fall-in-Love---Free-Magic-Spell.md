*   A bowl

*   Something to crush it and mix all together

*   Have a photo of the two people

 Light the candles and place the photos standing behind them. Have the paper laid out in front of you and draw a Pentagram it doesn't have to be perfect. Put the bowl on top of the Pentagram. Grab the sugar and cinnamon and put it inside the bowl, mix it around till it fully is, add the roses and mash them in there until their small and scattered. And start putting it into the vile. Chant:

"Goddess Aphrodite, hear my cry
Give these two people love at firts sight
Let them have strength and passion
Let them be protect with all your might
Let (name) and (name) be together
So mote it be"

When you are done put a drop of lavender and vanilla extract on top then close the vile. If you have a garden I prefer you burry it deep if you don't just hide it somewhere no one will ever find it.
