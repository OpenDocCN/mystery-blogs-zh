 ## Casting Instructions for 'How To Summon Bill Cipher'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A Picture Of Your Enemy

*   A Red Marker

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   8 Candles

*   A Picture Of Your Enemy

*   A Red Marker

 Walk outside, be relaxed. Set down the candles in a circle. Take the red marker and your enemies picture and cross out their eyes. Set it in the middle of the circle. Sit by the circle. Say these words:

"Triangulum, entangulum. meteforis dominus ventium. meteforis venetisarium" Your eyes will glow blue and the sky shall turn grey. You're in the mindscape!

Say this now!: "Asetnoheptus Asetnoheptus Asetnoheptus Asetnoheptus Asetnoheptus"
Now quick! Go inside for ten minutes and you will see a star floating towards you! It's small and slow. That is your Cipher. Ask him your age, if he replies in your head correctly, you have a Cipher.

Now To Make A Deal!: Just note you can make a deal once a month, anyways take caution when doing this just like humans, he can break his deals! Anyways ask him "Can I/We make a deal?" if he replies with yes you're good. List the items you would like, (Ex:Protection, Mind Reading, Teleporting) once you've listed them ask him "What would you like from this deal?" he will list items that he will like, if you do not like the first choice ask for another. His main three are sleep possession, able to read your mind and see your pat, or taking your soul!

Now once you've chosen tell him when it'll start and shake his hand.

Tips:
- If your in a group ask him to send what he's saying to group members
- Do not be scared he may be upset
- He has feelings and get sad
- He will rarely leave you

I have a TON of questions. 1\. Do i have to be outside or can i just run to another room? 2\. How small is the Cipher? 3\. Will the sky turn gray at night and how will i know ive successfully entered the mindscape? 4\. What do i do if he dosent show up but the sky is gray, he guesses incorrectly about my age or he dosent like the deal ive offered? Plz help me thank you!!!

Bill Cipher is a fantasy animated character from the show Gravity Falls. You can't physically summon a being that only exist in a television show.

oh my gods O_o i wish this was possible [yes i've seen the show! yes i know it's a bad idea, he's my favourite character so don't at me!] i would of done this already if it was possible. at bet you can make a thoughtform or servature like Bill, but it won't be him sadly [Remember the universe is a hologram, reality is an illusion, buy gold byeeee]

does this really work?

no. he's fictional, at best you can create a thoughtform to behave as Bill, but you can't summon him [which is a shame because he's such a delightful fello]
