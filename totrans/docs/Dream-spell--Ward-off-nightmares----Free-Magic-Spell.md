1\. With a pencil (must be sharpened), draw a small cloud in the middle of your paper. Then write down one secret and one happy memory from any time. Fold the paper and hide it where nobody can find it except you. (Everyone, even your pet(s)).
2\. Take a white candle and place it in the middle of your cloud. (Unfold the paper). Do not burn yet.
3\. Chant the following:

My dreams have taken over me,
Horrible dreams for me,
Gods of light and heaven thee,
Grant me my wish,
I wish for no more sorrow,
Please grant me happy dreams.

What counts as a mis-cast?:
1\. The paper is gone, someone finds the paper. Anything that has to do with where the paper is found.
2\. Your pencil breaks, or the candle is lit too early.

4\. Someone comes in the room you use the spell in.

This spell requires an edit. As is, I feel this would work more as a placebo. Take the paper, draw the cloud, write a happy memory or desire such as ''I will not have nightmares.'' That part of the spell is fine. You should fold the paper towards you because you want this to come to you. Hold the paper and imagine positive dreams. You could burn the paper, but safely. Use tweezers so as not to burn yourself, and place it in a fireproof container. You can keep water nearby as well as a lid to be safe. Do this on a flat surface with nothing flammable nearby. I suggest doing so outside. Once the paper is burned, the fire will go out. It will just be scary for a moment when the whole thing goes up in flames. If you do not wish to risk fire, I would place the paper in a white bag with a few crystals and/or herbs, and place it under or on your bed. This will create a protection charm for your dreams. Some items you could use include lavender, chamomile, pink Himalayan salt, anise, dandelion root, bay leaf, peppermint, rosemary, amethyst, black tourmaline, lapis lazuli, clear quartz and rose quartz. Finally, the chant requires work. You should state your intention, and if you wish to call on a deity, you can, but it can be as simple as ''Good dreams come to me, as I will it, so shall it be.''
