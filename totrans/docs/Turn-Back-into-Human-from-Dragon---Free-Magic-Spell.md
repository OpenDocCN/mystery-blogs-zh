# Turn Back into Human from Dragon

  Rated 5/5 Stars

The previous spell I made (dragon transformation) didn't have a cure to be a human again, so if you want this information, here it is.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Turn Back into Human from Dragon'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** You must relax your mind, and think of you being a human again. Think of you being the way your were when you were human. Feel your blood course through your body, your heart beating. Then imagine yourself changing back into your human form.

At the same time chant the following: "Humans, humans, humans, I wish to be a human. I would love and desire nothing more than to be who I used to be. God, let me change once again to who I was, who I truly am. A human is what I wish to be".

It should work within minutes or hours, like I said in my dragon transformation spell, it all depends on you.

you are human, you cannot transform into a Dragon, so this ''spell'' is pointless.

no one is actually human we all have magic inside of us we just have to believe

magick is a natural, neutral energy found within and around us, but as a species born on the physical plane, we are human. Dragons are astral beings. Since magick on the physical behaves differently than on the astral [it's ruled by nature on the physical and is limited by nature as a result] you cannot become a Dragon. You can work with them, but you can't transform into one.

As you will only every be human, this spell is superfluous.
