When it comes to altars, there‚Äôs no need to remain anchored to a fixed altar. While you may have a favorite sacred space, a fixed circle in which to carry out your spells, there is a wonderful option to consider for those traveling witch: **The Travel Altar**.

## The Traveling Witch‚Äôs Altar

**A travel altar or *portable altar*** is a small box, which can be made of wood, tin or even fabric, that contains , all that you deem necessary to practice when you cannot use your altar at home.

If you live on the road, travel frequently, or just take a vacation, these are some things you should add to your travel altar, and some inspiration for making your first portable altar:

### Container box

You want something enough to protect your sacred tools, but with a soft inside to absorb the shock of traveling. A good option could be that of a jewelry box. They come in all shapes and colors, and some have various small drawers and some padding.

### Candles

Tealight candles are small enough to carry in your travel box and will be useful for any quick spells while on the road. They are lightweight and don‚Äôt require a candle holder since they have their own aluminum container. How to use candles in your spells?

### Pentacle

You can draw it on paper, wood or stone, or you can bring a pentacle pendant which can also be your amulet for your travels. Many Wiccans use the [Pentacle](https://spells8.com/celtic-pentacle/) in their personal Craft as well as other [protection symbols](https://spells8.com/10-magical-symbols/).

### Other Items to Bring

Salt, water, oil, spices: you can put them in small glass bottles or ampoules. Some are very small and you can easily find them in craft and esoteric shops. For burning incense, cones can be the ideal solution since they are small and easy to carry.

There are many other [**Tools of the Witch**](https://spells8.com/topic/wiccan-witchcraft-tools/) such as an [athame](https://spells8.com/athame-uses-ritual-knife/), wand and cup, which you may choose to bring with you or not, depending on the circumstances and space they will take.

You can also include a few [Crystals for Protection](https://forum.spells8.com/t/crystals-for-protection/2433) in your small travel altar.

## Small Altar Ideas

As a traveling Witch, you can have many different travel altars with different purposes. For example, an altar dedicated to the [elements](https://spells8.com/four-directions-elemental-beings/), one for a [patron deity](https://spells8.com/lessons/finding-patron-deity/), or one to practice your [divinations](https://spells8.com/divination-methods/). This depends on your personal needs and how you are going to use it while traveling.

For all those young Wiccans and Pagans who cannot practice freely at home, you can keep a decorated box under your bed, in the bottom of the a drawer or above the wardrobe, to keep your small altar safe.

There will certainly be university students among the pagans who find themselves having to live in dorms, with very little privacy left for their spiritual practice.
