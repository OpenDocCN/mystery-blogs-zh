This is a rather simple cleansing. Take your time, relax, and feel the negative energy leaving your body [you should feel calm, content, and lighter by the end]

This should work. I dislike the complexity of the first chant, but that is a personal qualm. I believe chants should be simple to ensure repetition so you can enter a trance state. The second chant would do the trick.
