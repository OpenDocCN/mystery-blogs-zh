# Buddhist Protection Ritual

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This is a very powerful ritual with mudras that will banish demons. It will protect you and anyone can do it.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Buddhist Protection Ritual'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** First, clasp both palms and two middle finger tips touching each other. Both of the middle fingers should be slightly bent. Both of the thumbs erected and they are placed above the heart. Then chant for 7 times with that hand position or mudra:

"Namo ratna trayaya. Namah arya-valokite svaraya. Bodhisattva ya. Maha Sattva ya. Maha Karunikaya. Tadyata Om chakra-varti cintamani maha padme ruru. Krishna jvala akarsaya. Hum phat svaha."

This makes demons no longer be able to enter your body. Then, with the hand position, say:

"Om padma Cintamani Jvala Hum.
Om Varada Padme Hum."

Next, place your right hand on top of your left hand with your palm facing upwards. Then use the right hand's pinkie to hook the left hand thumb while the right hand's thumb hooks the left hand pinkie. Chant for 3 times:

"Om. Arya-avalokite svaraya Bodhisattva ya. Maha Sattvaya. Maha Karunikaya. Tadyatha. Om cinkali cinkali maha cinkali cinkalitali cin kalitara svaha."

Place the hand position or mudra you just made on your head. You can then release your hands.

I am not Buddhist so I cannot tell how effective this is, but I doubt it has enough strength to banish a demon. I feel the higher you are spiritually, the more powerful this ritual could be, but if you do not put energy into it and rush through the ritual, I doubt it will do anything. The key to these chants are repetition.
