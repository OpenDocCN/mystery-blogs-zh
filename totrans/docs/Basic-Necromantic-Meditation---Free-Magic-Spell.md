# Basic Necromantic Meditation

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This is how I personally meditate before doing necromancy. It will help tune your senses and tell spirits you're not there to harm them.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Basic Necromantic Meditation'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   7 black candles (optional)

*   Inverted pentagram amulet (optional)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   7 black candles (optional)

*   Inverted pentagram amulet (optional)

 Place the black candles in a circle around you if you are using the candles ( candles GREATLY help while they are not required if your a beginner please use the candles). Light the candles clockwise, sit in the middle of the dark room

Close your eyes and meditate but instead of clearing your mind picture the spirit you are trying to contact, if it is no one in peritcular just picture random spirit. Meditate this way for about 15 minutes. Blow put the candles in counter clockwise order.
