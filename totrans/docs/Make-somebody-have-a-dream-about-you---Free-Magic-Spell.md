# Make somebody have a dream about you

This is not my original spell, but many say it works

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Make somebody have a dream about you'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Wait until he/she is asleep. Then, think about him/her. What do they say often? Act like? Look like? 

Do this until you feel a tingle, like you have made a connection. Then play out a scene. Where are you? Your room? Your house? A garden? I do not suggest a haunted house. Haunted houses are usually not pleasant to dream about, nor that romantic. Have a normal conversation. Then you can do 1 of the 2\. You can kiss him/her, or you can hug him/her. Or both.
