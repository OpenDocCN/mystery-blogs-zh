Mars is your masculine side, your driving force, part of your sex drive, and how you’re motivated to make change in the world.

Your Mars shows how you obtain courage to act, what you’re passionate about, what you desire, and how you show aggression. Mars is all of the most base, animalistic feelings.

We need our Mars to push us towards what we’re passionate about and to be able to express ourselves in a truly authentic, visceral way.

At its worst, Mars makes us impulsive, reckless, or angry, but at its best, Mars can be a wonderful motivator and a great avenue to help us express ourselves. Though Mars in Gemini is typically mental, this placement does have a variety of types of energy because Gemini is so changeable.

## Mars in Gemini Characteristics

Mars in Gemini might not seem very chatty on first glance, but you’ll definitely see some of the characteristics pop up as you get to know them better.

Mars shows up in certain situations and is very dependent on the house. I’ve gone through Mars in Gemini in the houses below. Read through these characteristics, then see if the house alters them at all for you.

### Drive

When it comes to drive, Mars in Gemini people are interesting creatures. If you have Mars in Gemini, you probably thrive on change, but you’re easily bored.

You’re able to be *extremely* driven when you’re excited about something, but you need this boost of energy to get you going. If you’re not feeling the allure of something new, then you can easily slack off and become bored or even depressed.

In general, you thrive on change with Mars in Gemini. You’re dexterous and probably enjoy doing many different things.

You may even like to multi-task on some level. I find that many people with Mars in Gemini will listen to music or podcasts while they’re doing other things. These are the folks who always have something playing in the background.

People with Mars in Gemini are very good at speaking and writing. They have a compulsion to express themselves on both the physical world (with their words) as well as the digital one (through typing). Even if they’re not always perfect, what they say is often worth reading or listening to!

In general, to keep someone with Mars in Gemini engaged, there must be a sense of *variety.* When a Mars in Gemini person is bored, you can quite literally sense their exhaustion.

A bored Mars in Gemini mind can become quite erratic over time, so if you have this placement, it’s important that you exercise your mind in many different ways.

### Anger

Mars in Gemini is a warrior who doesn’t know the meaning of defeat. They will do anything to win, and words are their weapon! Their sharp tongue can cut someone’s reputation down with just one sentence, or they could stay quiet while cooking up more sarcastic remarks under your nose — all without looking like an aggressor (and thus avoiding conflict).

These savvy tactics make it difficult for you to trust that these witty folks won’t stab you in the back at any given opportunity.

Typically, words are *always* the weapon of the Mars in Gemini person, though you can look to specific aspects and houses to see exactly how this plays out.

The Mars in Gemini person may use words in a passive-aggressive manner by slandering someone behind their back, or they might just talk a fight to death in order to win. These people can be very aggressive when they feel like it.

Though Mars in Gemini people have *extremely* cunning minds, this can also be their downfall. They cam come up with logic that makes sense and argue their way out of anything, but it doesn’t mean that they’re actually right.

However, if you have Mars in Gemini, you probably *won’t* be aggressive as a fire sign Mars placement. You’re unlikely to hold onto an argument for a prolonged period of time (unless the houses/aspects say otherwise), but your words can be extremely cutting while you’re actually angry.

Be careful that you don’t generate conflict just because you’re bored or under-stimulated. Mars in Gemini people tend to lash out at others when they feel downtrodden and useless, even if the cause lies somewhere else.

### Career

Mars in Gemini may or may not impact a person’s career. Remember that Mars isn’t everything when it comes to how you feel about your job because there are many different factors at play beyond our personal desires.

People with this Mars placement *can* be known for their ability to multitask and juggle different things at once. They’re often naturally drawn towards cutting-edge careers such as those in the fashion industry, entertainment business, or sciences. Other career ideas include a media reporter, entrepreneur, manager for a fast-paced startup, etc.

Careers in communication can also be quite useful, since Mars in Gemini people love to work with words. You can look more at *how* you’ll be able to use words by analyzing the aspects and the house.

However, Mars in Gemini could also be a charming person who is skilled at talking your ear off. He or she will know how to get what s/he wants, but may not always do things ethically. 

When I think of Mars in Gemini, the image of the smooth-talking used car salesman comes to mind. With this placement, be careful that you provide as much as you receive (in monetary value or otherwise) so that your dealings remain fair energetically.

For more details about your career, I recommend that you look into your 10th house and aspects to your 10th house.

### Attraction

Although many planets contribute to the type of attraction that we feel for others as well as the attractive qualities that we give off, Mars is definitely a big factor.

People with Mars in Gemini are extremely social and outgoing. They enjoy talking to new people, so they’re always looking for the next interesting conversation.

Specifically, these folks are attracted to *interesting* minds. They may want someone who is fun to talk to, witty, or interesting in some way.

They will also notice another person’s level of confidence, social skills, body language, etc. Typically, people with Mars in Gemini enjoy being around others who are social and outgoing, if not super interesting or intelligent.

Depressed personalities definitely won’t do it for people with Mars in Gemini. They need someone who can actively stimulate their minds.

Sometimes, people with Mars in Gemini may even enjoy mind games during attraction. The chase can get them going.

They are usually attracted to stimulating conversation, jokes, open-mindedness, debates, thinking out of the box, people who enjoy trying new things, etc.

### Romance/Sex

People with Mars in Gemini enjoy romance as long as it’s new and fun. They probably tend to be romantic verbally rather than through actions.

Heavy emotions can be different for these folks. They *hate* irrational feelings and may avoid their own emotions instead of confronting them head-on.

In bed, people with Mars in Gemini probably enjoy using words or trying new things. Variety is key.

They are generally fun in bed, though you may find that it’s tough to connect with them on an intimate level, since they tend to stay on the mental plane. It can sometimes feel as though they’re not totally present during sex.

Mars in Gemini people may enjoy dirty talk or [Snap chat nudes](https://meetnfuck.com/snap-fuck.html). They get comfortable quite quickly, so variety is key. The *idea* of their partner must be sexy to them. If you’re looking for free sex cams, check these [free sites here](https://porninquirer.com/free-sex-cams/) first

## Mars in Gemini: Worst and Best Qualities

Every placement and sign has qualities that can be manifested positively *or* negatively. There is no better placement, and how you manifest these qualities depends on the planet they’re in and your own personal choices.

Here are some of the best and worst qualities of Mars in Gemini. Don’t forget that any of the so-called negative qualities can always be transmuted to something good! This is just to give you a starting place if you think you’d like to work on some of these qualities.

## Mars in Gemini: Male Vs Female

Mars and Venus will showcase different qualities for men and women depending on how they self-identify.

Generally, in a man, Mars will show *how he acts to attract,* whether consciously or subconsciously, and Venus will show *what kind of qualities he is attracted to.*

In a woman, Mars will show *what kind of qualities she is attracted to,* while Venus will show *how she acts to attract.*

Feel free to choose the label that works best for you in this context (being attracted to another person).

For example, sometimes a gay man will identify with the male archetype because he tends to be attracted to feminine qualities in other men, while other times a gay man will identify with the female archetype of his Mars because he is attracted the masculine qualities that his Mars gives off.

These archetypes aren’t used by everyone and definitely aren’t absolute. I’m a straight woman, but I find that sometimes the vibes from my Mars shows up when I’m flirting.

Take this all with a grain of salt: this is the traditional way of doing it. I don’t think it’s 100% accurate, but in my experience, there’s a good 80% of truth in these archetypes for the average person.

### The Male: Mars in Gemini

In a typical guy, Mars shows not only his drive, passion, anger, etc., but the vibes that he puts out to attract a partner (whether or not he even means to).

The Mars in Gemini man must learn how to live in reality and share his most authentic feelings, even if he needs to dissect them on a mental basis first.

## How to Master the Mars in Gemini Energy

With Mars in Gemini, you must learn how to stay on track and finish projects. You tend to be a bit scattered, but you do have the capacity to hunker down and get things done.

You need to learn how to settle into your body and *feel* your emotions rather than just thinking about them. You tend to ignore your body’s needs in favor of your mind, but with Mars in Gemini, you can certainly learn how to do both.

When it comes to relationships, it’s important that you find someone who can match your mental acuity. If your mind isn’t stimulated by a parter, you won’t truly feel fulfilled over the long haul.

However, you *also* must learn to actually commit to things, whether it be people, work, ideas, etc. Mars in Gemini makes you a bit flighty, but in order to find happiness, you must discover a way to keep variety in your life *and* be able to make a commitment to someone or something.
