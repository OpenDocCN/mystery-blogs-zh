 You can dip water (preferably full moon water) on photos of you and your beloved. You can set a candle in a bowl of water and allow it to burn until the water extinguishes it. You also may want to use incense for the spell. However you must visualize your beloved arriving from afar to find your love.

**Chant:**

"**Sacred water flow from me.
To dray him ever near.
As endless rivers run to sea.
His path to me is clear.**

**A lover that's true once here he'll find,
And know his journey's end.
And in his heart and soul and mind,
He'll know our lives should blend."**
