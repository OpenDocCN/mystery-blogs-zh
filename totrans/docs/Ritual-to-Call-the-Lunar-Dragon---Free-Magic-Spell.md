# Ritual to Call the Lunar Dragon

  Rated 5/5 Stars

The lunar ''dragon'' is actually many beings. We refer to them as one. They are of the universe, they have guided us with or without this ritual. This may not work for anyone else, but it should give you prophetic dreams and allow you to lucidly contact the beings that influence us (Golden Diamond*, Tiamat, Kiazor, The universe herself, ect.)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Ritual to Call the Lunar Dragon'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Moon water

*   Dragon's blood oil

*   Vanilla incense and extract.

*   Any of the following: Tourmaline, Ametrine, Amethyst, ect.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Moon water

*   Dragon's blood oil

*   Vanilla incense and extract.

*   Any of the following: Tourmaline, Ametrine, Amethyst, ect.

 Set up a space in a moon-lit room. Outside can work but can be dangerous in most neighborhoods. Make sure when you lay that the moon will hit your entire body. Take the moon water and anoint a clear crystal (Tourmaline works, Ametrine is great, amethyst, ect.). You'll want to drink a little bit (No more than five drops) of the vanilla extract, burn the incense, and take the Dragon's blood oil and draw two Dragon-like eyes on the back of your hands.

Set the crystal on your third eye and astral project. When you astral project, you should hear a loud roar. The moon should feel like it's drawing you in. Let it do so, and you should see one of the beings that make up the Lunar dragon in front of you. If you see one soul deity, then you are talking to all of them. You can ask them anything you need guidance with.

*If Golden Diamond appears, she will be very tall with long golden hair with metallic strands. She has golden eyes. But if she appears, contact us immediately. We will have much to discuss.

The last line is odd [it sounds like a Steven Universe warning] While I've never heard of a ''lunar Dragon'' this could work since you're summoning an astral Dragon then projecting to meet with them. [it's just the last bit that makes me think it's fake] Try it and see if it works.

Since lunar dragons are not real, and the bottom paragraph sounds ridiculous, I am fairly certain this is fake.

I would consider the overall process to be useful as a way to call for, and meet with, an entity associated with the moon. Vanilla extracts can have a very strong, bittered-sweet taste, especially if using an artificial extract. I would suggest an alternative of getting an actual vanilla bean, scraping the middle, and placing that on the tongue. Same effect, but with a less... severe taste.

It would also be helpful to have in mind what form of a dragon/draconic energy you want to connect with; A dragon of the moon and what it represents? (Feminine, protection, 'motherly', observer, wisdom, etc) Or as an archetype representing the primordial energy of the moon and tides. Basically, ask yourself if you are focusing on meeting with an active entity, or on connecting with a quality of energy and vibration. Both are viable, but will lead to differing results.

Other stones that would be very effective; Moonstone (it's in the name), White opal, natural pearl, blue jade (a dream stone), celestite, or clear quartz.

The last line definitely makes me wonder if this really works but I will try it.
