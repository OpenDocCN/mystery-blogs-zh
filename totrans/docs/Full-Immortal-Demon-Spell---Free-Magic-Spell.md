What does sell your soul mean to you ?

It mean you give your soul to Satan or any demon

You cannot become an immortal demon.

hey tadashi how do you know if you haven't tried it same with all the other spells you have put down, besides don't you have anything better to do then going through all the spell sub categories and putting millions of spells down.

If someone was allergic to salmon you wouldn't go ''how do you know if you've only tried baked salmon? Have you tried teriyaki? You can't be allergic to all salmon if you haven't tried every type.'' If you actually know how magick works, what is and isn't possible, you don't have to try every spell to confirm it's fake. Tadashi's free to post facts about spells, and if he chooses to only call out the fake ones that's his choice, just as it's your choice to remain ignorant to the reality of real magick [in other words you're human and nothing will change that fact]

Yeah, but let others think that they can. Lol but ur right. Even if know that (even though I don't want to know that)

essentially ignorance is bliss? seems dangerous to me, but if people wish to ignore reality so they can live in their happy fantasy world, it's their choice.

The soul becomes corrupted by the demon that you sold which is now its property so basically you got screwed and the demon now has a slave forever. What a great audience.

Hehe souled. Like soul-sole-sold. Nevermind.

Hey, even if it might not work, let them dream that it does. Their choice what they wanna think. (Please don't take this to offense)

You can't say ''don't take offence'' because people can react emotionally due to factors out of your control [they have a bad day for example. In written text, we can't hear your tone. I'm not offended, I just wanted to comment on that] True, people can believe whatever, but there is a line. You can believe vaccines are dangerous and choose not to vaccinate your kids. You have the right to ignore the facts and believe that, but you put people at risk. We are trying to explain it isn't possible. If someone reads the explanation and still chooses to believe, that's fine. My hope, in that case, is one day they discover the truth for themselves, and on that day, they are willing to adjust their view. [that's going for myself and the other members who try to teach in the comments. We are always growing and learning. To quote Daria: ''Stand firm for what you believe in, until and unless logic and experience proves you wrong.'' I honestly can't tell you the number of times I believed something only to learn something new and change my worldview because of it.]

No one knows what demons really are

Everyone saying you cant become an immortal demon, why you might not be able to become immortal you could take on the powers of a demon and live as long as they do which is definitely longer than a human. worth a try.

You cannot obtain ''powers'', especially not from daemons, nor live hundreds of years. This spell is utterly fake.
