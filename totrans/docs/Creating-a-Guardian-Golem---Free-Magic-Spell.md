# Creating a Guardian Golem

This is an old family spell I'm willing to share because there are some creatures out there that magicks won't affect and not too many magick users are practiced in self defense anymore.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Creating a Guardian Golem'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Salt

*   White Chalk

*   Ingredient you want your golem made of ( I prefer using stone myself)

*   4 candles of the elemental color you are going to use

*   Strong faith in a deity that you follow

*   Small offering, nothing living but food or wine will work

*   1 gem of the color that represents you

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Strong faith in a deity that you follow

*   Small offering, nothing living but food or wine will work

*   1 gem of the color that represents you

 Warning: This is not a spell to bind the elemenal force but to invite them into a vessel you built for them. Never bind elementals because they are forces of nature and in doing so you can and will tip the balance!
Assemble your ingredients first and foremost.
Shape the wood, stone, steel or mud into the shape of the golem and place the gem where its heart would be with a narrow channel leading into the gem holding area.
Using the chalk and salt to ward away demons from taking possession draw a dual circle one of invitation on the inside and one of protection on the outside following the deity you follow guidelines.
Using the candles light each one and place them in the true directions of north south east and west.
Place the offering of food or wine at the feet of the golem husk and call out to your deity:

> **"Oh (deities name) I ask as your humble servant to beseech the elemental forces on my behalf and invite them to use the creation I have made as a vessel here in the mortal world in exchange for the protection of myself and mine kith and kin, by your power so let it be."**
