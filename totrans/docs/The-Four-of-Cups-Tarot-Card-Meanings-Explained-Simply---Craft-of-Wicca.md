 ## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the Four of Cups card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

 Here is a new interpretation of the Four of Cups tarot card:

 The Four of Cups tarot card represents the feeling of being “emotionally full” but not necessarily fulfilled.

For instance, in today’s society, social media and instant gratification can make people feel like they are constantly experiencing new things and emotions, but it can also make them feel like they are missing out on something, leading to feelings of dissatisfaction or a sense of emptiness.

 The Four of Cups in this context represents the state of feeling like you have everything you need, but still feeling unfulfilled.

 Another possible interpretation could be that the Four of Cups represents the feeling of being “over-connected” but disconnected at the same time.

With the rise of technology and social media, people are constantly connected to others and have access to a vast amount of information, but it can also make them feel disconnected from their inner selves, emotions, and the things that truly matter.

 The Four of Cups in this context represents the state of feeling connected to the world but disconnected from oneself.

 In summary, the Four of Cups can be interpreted as representing the state of feeling emotionally full but not fulfilled and the state of feeling over-connected but disconnected from oneself.
