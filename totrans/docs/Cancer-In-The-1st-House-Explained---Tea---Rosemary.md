If you have Cancer in the 1st House, you are likely to be a sensitive and nurturing person who cares deeply about your loved ones. You may have a strong emotional connection to your family and home and may find it difficult to separate your personal and professional lives.

In relationships, you may be very caring and supportive of your partner, but may also be prone to mood swings and emotional outbursts. You may have a tendency to put your partner’s needs before your own, and may struggle with setting boundaries or saying no. This can make you bottle up your emotions, but they’ll need to come out at some point, which is why you can be seen as emotionally volatile.

You may naturally take on a caregiver role in your relationships, providing emotional support and comfort to your partner. However, it’s essential to strike a balance to ensure your own emotional needs are met as well.
