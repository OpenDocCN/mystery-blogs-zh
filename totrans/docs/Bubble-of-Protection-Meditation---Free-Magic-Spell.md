Fill the bubble with love. Know that it will protect you where ever you go.

To protect a loved one:

Now picture your loved one. See a glowing light all around them. It is just like the bubble you are in. It glows with safety and protection. Make it stronger, bigger, brighter. Visualize this as long as you like. When you are done, wish your loved one well and know that they are safe.

Now prepare to end the meditation. Feel your circle of light bring you back to the present moment and the room you are in. Take a deep breath and stretch for a moment before you get up.

Let the candles burn as long as you like, then snuff them out. You may light them at any time you wish to strengthen the visualization and protection.
