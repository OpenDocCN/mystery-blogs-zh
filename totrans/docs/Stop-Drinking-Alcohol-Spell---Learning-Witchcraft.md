# Stop Drinking Alcohol Spell - Learning Witchcraft

> 来源：[https://learningwitchcraft.com/stop-drinking-alcohol-spell/#0001-01-01](https://learningwitchcraft.com/stop-drinking-alcohol-spell/#0001-01-01)

This spell is intended to help you to stop drinking alcohol and it is adapted from the spell to stop smoking. As it is a banishing spell, this is best when performed either during either a waning or new moon. Disclaimer: If you happen to be physically addicted to alcohol, you should never attempt to quit without talking to your doctor. Quitting alcohol cold turkey can be dangerous to your health.

**You Will Need:**

– 10 to 15 small pieces of paper, about the size of a post it note
– A pen
– Empty bottle of your alcohol of choice, with lid, washed beforehand
– Black cord or string
– Glass of water
– Amethyst crystal or orgonite

Prior to performing this spell, you will need to take some time and reflect on the reasons why it is a good idea to quit drinking alcohol. Write each of your reasons down on an individual piece of paper.

**Examples include:**

– Spending too much money on drinking
– The feeling of waking up with a hangover
– More likely to argue with people while drinking

Start your ritual with [casting a circle](https://learningwitchcraft.com/how-to-cast-a-circle-of-protection/), then meditating for a few minutes until feeling calm and clear minded. Gather all pieces of paper and pick one up, reading aloud. Affirm the opposite of it, as if you have already quit drinking.

**For example:**

– Spending too much money on drinking turns into: I have a lot of money now that I am no longer drinking.
– Waking up with a hangover turns into : Waking up feeling clear-headed and fresh.
– More likely to argue with people while drinking turns into: My relationships are better after becoming sober.

Take a little while to feel exactly what it should feel like if this were true. Imagine being a non-drinker and rejoicing in how happy, healthy and free that you feel without this habit. Put each piece of paper that you have been holding onto into that empty bottle of your favorite alcohol.

Pick up your next piece of paper and repeat the steps until every piece of paper is in the bottle. Put on the lid. Tie your black cord around the neck of the bottle, securing it with three knots. Take your glass of water and imagine there being a beautiful beaming light inside it. Drink your water slowly, feeling the light going into your body and throughout with each sip, purifying you and also blessing you.

Take the amethyst and the cup between your hands and feel a calming, white light as it circulates around your body, getting stronger and stronger, then flowing into and through the amethyst. Then, imagine the crystal with the light energy and pulsing. Sit with the meditation for a few minutes until you have your intuition telling you that you are now done.

Say out loud: I am now a non-drinker and so mote it be.

You need to feel this to be true. Close your circle and you can bury the bottle in the ground or throw it away, whichever you prefer.

Once you are done with this ritual, you can carry the amethyst around with you. If you start to feel as though you have to drink alcohol, you can drink a glass of water and then repeat the visualization as before.
