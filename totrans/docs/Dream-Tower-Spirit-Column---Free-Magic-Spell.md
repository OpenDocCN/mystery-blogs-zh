First, draw a large Dream Tower Pentagram. Place one container on the symbols of each arm and put the candle in the center. Light the candle. Put salt in the container on the upper right point. Place all of the stones in the container on the upper left. The rosemary goes in the bottom left, garlic in the bottom right. Mix the tea and Whisper Powder in the top container. If your using 6 containers, set the sixth to the side for later. Chant the words ''Lat Ganore'' over the materials and picture good thoughts being pulled into the pieces and dark thoughts being locked away or destroyed in the flames. Begin assembling the parts, putting stones on the bottom, then salt, the garlic, rosemary, and last the tea and Whisper Powder. If you are using 6 containers use the last to cap the tower. Make sure to seal these so nothing falls out. To finish it off, draw the symbol for protection or dreams, however you picture it. Place it somewhere near the bed of whomever is to be effected by the tower. It should help. Please feel free to message me with any questions or comments.

(I made one of these for a friend and she said it worked great)
