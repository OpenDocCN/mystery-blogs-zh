Next lite the black candle and pout a good bit of the melted wax into the herbal mix. finally stir the black wax thoroughly in the herbal mix and pout the mix in the small vile and find a cork of some kind to cap of the vile. finally pout a layer of the melted wax on top of the cork until it is completely covering the whole top of the vile. next lightly carve in to the wax the ancient alphabet that symbolizes protection and binding.

See, this is a prime example of a flawed spell. Rosemary, cloves and black string; Fine choices for a cleansing or protection jar. Star anise, this could work if you are protecting your psychic ability since its primary energy is for psychic awareness. Werewolf blood, is not a thing. Yes, there are oils like bats blood, dragons blood, doves blood and flying oil which are not literal blood nor do they make you physically fly. However, there is no Magikal oil known as werewolves blood, at least as far as I am aware. This leads to my conclusion, this spell does not work as outlined. However, with a few minor changes, it has the potential to work. I would substitute werewolf blood for moon water, either omit the star anise or include another protection herb such as anise seeds which has more protection energy than star anise. Since this is to be worn, I would carve a protection symbol or sigil instead of spelling it out in an ancient alphabet. If you have never carved symbols into wax, it can be tricky. As for the *dark energy* part, I assume this is meant to be a type of witches bottle protection. If that is the case, you would need to add a few items. Witches bottles protect the witch from others casting on them. You will need items like thistle, burrs, broken glass, rusty nails, and other sharp/harmful objects. The idea is to work like a Magikal landmine and shoot shrapnel at your enemy should they attack you first. If this is the case, you need to know how to work the energy. Focus positive protective energy when you add the protection items, and baneful energy when adding the nails. You should also say a chant that explains what you are doing like ''Should anyone send ill to me, I send it back to them times three.''
