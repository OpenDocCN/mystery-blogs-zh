 This is a good spell to use against a slanderer or anyone who is trying to negatively influence others against you. This spell can also be used if you have a day in court and your opponent is dishonestly trying to Influence others.

This is a freezing spell.

If someone is working against you in a personal or legal matter and you know their name, you can try a freezing spell.

Write their name on a piece of parchment paper using a freshly sharpened pencil. Try to make the point of the pencil extremely sharp/pointy.

Fold the paper in half, until it is too small to fold anymore.

While you are folding instill your desires to make them stop lying, mocking or turning others against you. In short you are trying to freeze their actions. (Hence the spell name ).

Then pour vodka or denatured alcohol on the paper. I would advise doing this over the sink. Then put it far back in the corner of your freezer.

Leave it there for 28-30 days. Some believe this should be started during a waning moon.

This should stop the slander. Thus it has frozen them out.

Feel free to add any chants, candle magick etc. to infuse this spell with your intentions. Remember all magickal work HAS to be instilled with your intent. Adjust things as you feel comfortable.
