I am not entirely sure what ''elementals'' are, representations of the elements I assume, but you can not make spiritual beings physically manifest before your eyes.

Tadashi, why are you on this site if you don't believe any of it? And elements are like water, fire wind, and earth. (maybe things like moon if ya wanna add) but there is some truth to faries, just like lots of things. They might not be tiny creatures with wings, they can even look like gremlin trolls.

I love how people assume I do not believe in anything simply because I disagree with nonsense spells. If you read my profile, you would see I do believe in Magic and I am Wiccan. I also work with The Fae, and I know they are nothing like the happy friendly creatures popularized today. Elementals are spiritual representations of the elements, but this spell does not explain what the author meant. The traditional ones are air, fire, water and earth, but it can also include wood, metal, plasma, void, spirit and countless others based on specific paths and personal belief. This spell also uses the claims of seeing the elementals and summoning them, which leads me to conclude they are claiming you say this chant and a flaming salamander appears, or a sprite made of water starts prancing around. The spirits are not physical, so if one is expecting it to physically appear before them, it will not work. This spell also appears rather incomplete, so as is, I do not believe it will work as it claims.
