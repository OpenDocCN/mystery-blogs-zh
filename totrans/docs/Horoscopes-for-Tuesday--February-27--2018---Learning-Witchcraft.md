## Is Today Your Birthday?

You won’t lack for opportunities this year and if you use them wisely you will accomplish great things. Even if you don’t use them wisely you will still gain in some way, but 12 months from now you may look back and wonder what might have been.

### AQUARIUS

There is nothing wrong with wanting your own way but if you expect too much you may be disappointed. Also, make sure that what you claim as your own is not already in someone else’s possession. You’ll have a tough time taking it from them.

### PISCES

Values planet Venus is on good terms with passion planet Pluto at the moment, so whatever it is you cherish the most will bring joy to you and those you love. Just remember that people should always be valued more highly than things.

### ARIES

Try not to be too aggressive in word or deed today. By all means be competitive, by all means aim to win, but do so in a sporting fashion. Always be respectful of your opponents, even when you are trying to beat them decisively.

### TAURUS

You have taken the first steps toward your new goal, now all you have to do is keep on walking. Your rivals will, of course, put obstacles in your path but they won’t bother you much. One way or another you’ll find ways to get past them.

### GEMINI

You may not be in control of certain events but you must not feel hard done by or sorry for yourself. Focus on what you can do and do it to the very best of your ability. The most important thing is that you are in control of yourself.

### CANCER

The possibility of failure simply does not occur to you and because your attitude is so positive you will accomplish things above and beyond what was expected of you. Remember though: once you set the bar high you cannot lower it again.

### LEO

You need to believe in yourself more, especially on the work front where your creativity, as well as your commitment, is beginning to attract attention. People in positions of power are watching you closely. Make sure they like what they see.

### VIRGO

Don’t pretend to care about someone just because you think it is expected of you. You may be a nice guy by nature but you are human like everyone else and are entitled to have favorites, and enemies. Dislikes are every bit as valid as likes.

### LIBRA

Someone you don’t usually have much to do with will be excessively friendly toward you today. What are they after? Actually, your ruling planet Venus suggests they may not want anything in return for your friendship. Try not be so suspicious.

### SCORPIO

Radical changes are taking place all around you and it is quite natural that you should be a bit anxious. Share your concerns with friends and family members and people you can trust – there’s strength in numbers and it will help relieve the stress.

### SAGITTARIUS

Family and financial matters are under excellent stars today and if you can find a way to combine the two you will enrich not only yourself but those you love as well. It’s good to have friends but blood ties are stronger, so take care of your own.

### CAPRICORN

The choices you take over the next 24 hours will to a large extent determine how well, or how badly, an important relationship develops. Choose your words carefully and, if you do have to be critical, season your disapproval with plenty of praise.
