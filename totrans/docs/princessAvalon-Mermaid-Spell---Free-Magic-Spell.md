Now I'm a human, now I'm a mermaid

Now I have legs, now I have tail.

Poseidon, Deviona, bless me with this gift.

I would like a tail, not two feet.

When I'm dry, my tail disappear.

Mystery of land, mystery of sea, 

Poseidon, Deviona, bless me with this gift."

Magick can't transform you into a mermaid, and I wouldn't go calling on deities for fake and rather trite spells.

Go to the bottom of the page. Read that. And shut up.

Lol alright, another person who apparently thinks being rude and hostile makes an argument come across well. Also, bottom of the page? You mean in the article where it says it will take a month and seven days? Seems irrelevant to my point, considering it's fake either way. The bottom of the page where it says that you should use common sense when following the spells? Because I'm just pointing out the common sense that should be used. Other than just coming across as a bit irritable, I'm not really sure what you were going for with your comment.

But they said it would work in one month and seven days! Why would someone lie on the internet? Seriously, I do love how people who don't like us explaining why certain spells don't work go attack dog instead of having an informed rebuttal. Anyway, Challenger, Rhododendrons isn't being mean, they're explaining a fact. Magick doesn't contradict nature, therefore physical transformations like the one mentioned in this ''spell'' is completely fake. You can look into working with astral mermaids [as some do believe they exist] calling on water spirits in your spells, working with deities associated with water, or associating the element and mermaid imagery into your path. But you cannot become a physical mermaid because that's not how magick works.

Why do you all even go on this site if you dont believe anything Nekoshema? And the other dude with the deer pic also dont be rude its not your spell

Avika, Nekoshema is not being rude. She is pointing out that it is not real, and so is Rhododendron. It's not that we don't believe, it is the fact that we know real and not real magick.

Rhodonendron or myself? Our profile pictures both have antlers. If you actually clicked on my picture, it would take you to my profile and the answers you seek. Firstly, my current picture is of The Horned God and The Triple Goddess, my deities I worship. If you read my profile, you would discover I was raised Wiccan, I believe in Magic, and have zero tolerance for fake spells. Real Magic is a natural energy. On the physical plane, it is ruled by nature, and does not defy nature. You can work with astral mermaids, you can use their symbolism in your craft, you can put on a fake tail and pretend to be a mermaid. What you cannot do is physically transform into one as it defies nature.

Rhododendron is right magick can not transform you into anything that's not what its meant for

This will transform you in a mermaid! I tried it works! In my dream :3

You might wish to reword this. [I'm assuming this is either a joke or a spiritual transformation, but it comes off as if it physically worked]
