## **The Triple Goddess: A Journey Through Time and Cultures**

Throughout history of paganism, the concept of a triple deity has been revered in various cultures and mythologies. The roots of the triple goddess Celtic tradition can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where three goddesses with distinct aspects were worshipped. In Celtic society, the celtic triple goddess **Brighid** embodied the skills of healing, poetry, and witchcraft.

The influential book, *The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth*by Robert Graves, further explored the idea of a Triple Goddess worshiped across pre-Christian paganism in Europe and the ancient Middle East. This book served as an inspiration for the development of Wicca, which incorporated the concept of the **Triple Goddess** into its belief system. The Triple Goddess became firmly rooted in Wicca during the 1970s, with the Maiden, Mother, and Crone archetypes taking center stage in neopaganism.

3.  **The Crone and the Waning Crescent**: As the Moon transitions back to darkness, the Crone aspect takes center stage during the waning crescent phase. This phase symbolizes wisdom, endings, and transformation, mirroring the Crone's role as the wise elder.
