no, doesn't work, you cannot physically shapeshift. [though I give points for rhyming ''bird'' with ''absurd'', gave me a laugh]

Why is it called a ''grey shapeshifter''? Is that different from a regular shapeshifter?

You cannot physically shapeshift into anything.

im really confused with this spell but i want to try it but im in college but candeles are a safety hazard for dorm rooms at my college so all i have is just a defuser to make room smell nice

plus why do we need dandilons that's what bunnies like to eat

this spell is done by transfiguration and belief

Shapeshifting isn't possible with magick I'm afraid. No amount of belief will change that. You could use transformation spells to help you grow, or shapeshifting on a spiritual level, but physically, it doesn't work.
