Just lick the movie you say? You cannot become a vampire.

I want to be a vampire in real life

You cannot. Vampires like the ones in movies are astral beings. Real Magic on the physical plane does not defy nature as it is ruled by nature. It is an energy that effects the energy around us to bring a desired natural change. As a human, you cannot physically transform into anything else physically.

What is the side effects of this

sorry, this is not working, and vampires are not like in movies or tv shows, which it purpose only for entertainment. but let me tell you a bit, physic vampire require negative charge, so they can adsorbs energy in. but this is very harmful for other nearby people, and yet they need other people energy sacrifice everytime for them, because they couldn't produce it by themself, it is opposite from usual human energy.

It does work i'm getting side effects
