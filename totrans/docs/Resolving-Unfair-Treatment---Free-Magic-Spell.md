# Resolving Unfair Treatment

A binding spell is performed by grasping the negative energy that is propelling a person or object, and stopping it. If you desire justice, which often we do, then call upon Egyptian goddess Maat, she who balances the scales. This spell might be used if you feel you are being unfairly treated by a colleague or a family member.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Resolving Unfair Treatment'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Black ribbon about 30 cm (12 inches) long

*   White feather (to represent Maat)

*   Frankincense incense

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Black ribbon about 30 cm (12 inches) long

*   White feather (to represent Maat)

*   Frankincense incense

 Light the incense at least half an hour before you take action so that your sacred space is as clear as you can make it. Contemplate your difficulty and acknowledge any part you may play in it.

Tie three knots in the ribbon - one in the middle and one at each end. As you tie the first, say: "Negativity here be bound". As you tie the second: "Nastiness I do confound". As you tie the third: "By power of three, now you impound."

Put the ribbon and the feather together on your altar or sacred space. Leave it alone for three days for justice to be done. After this time take the ribbon and bury it, if possible in open ground.

Keep the feather in your drawer or purse as a reminder of your willingness to be free. You must remember to control your own emotions of hatred or fear, for you must be above reproach. When you feel that the problem has dissipated, be tolerant and try to remain on good terms with the person concerned, but never tell them what you have done.
