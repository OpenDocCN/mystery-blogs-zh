Write the name of the object you are searching for on the slip of paper. Then, light the candle or tea light and ignite the paper with the candle or tea light. As the paper burns, say the spell five times:

I call upon the forces that you have jumped,
For an object of mine needs to be found.
Whether it be lost or stolen,
Seek out this object because this charm is spoken.

When the paper has burnt completely, blow out the candle or tea light and have compete faith that this spell will work.
