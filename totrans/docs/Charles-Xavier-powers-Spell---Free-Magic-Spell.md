This will not give you telepathic powers like Charles Xavier. This will not work.

yeah not working, we are here to find real spell. and if you do fantasy spell or trick spell please put it in proper section.

You cannot become Charles Xavier with a spell.

Like for real tho also could it be possible to use a spell to convince someone to do something or give u something

Apologies, I just saw this question. If you are expecting an Xavier reaction of thinking something and someone doing it unquestioningly, no. There are spells which can influence people, but they are more suggestions, like a nagging thought, and will wear off.

not a real spell. doesnt even need testing its so obvious
