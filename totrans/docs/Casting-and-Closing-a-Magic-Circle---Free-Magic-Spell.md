**You will need the following items for this spell:**

 **Opening a Magic Circle**
Smooth an altar cloth out over a flat surface. If you are opening a white magic circle, trace the circle in a clockwise (or 'deosil') motion, then draw the pentagram within, starting from the north point. If you are opening a black magic circle, trace the circle in a counter-clockwise (or 'widdershins') motion, then draw the inverted pentagram within, starting from the south point.

Hold your power (writing) hand palm-open over the circle and direct your magical potential into it. Imagine the lines of the circle glowing in a color corresponding to its intent (white light for white magic, red light for black magic, etc.).

**Closing a Magic Circle**
Hold your power (writing) hand palm-open over the circle and command the flow of magical energy to cease. Imagine the light you visualized earlier snuffing out like a candle flame or a barely-still-burning charcoal.

Sprinkle sea salt in a clockwise rotation over the altar cloth with your power hand.Use your besom (or broom) to clean your altar cloth, thereby literally and metaphorically sweeping any leftover magic away.
