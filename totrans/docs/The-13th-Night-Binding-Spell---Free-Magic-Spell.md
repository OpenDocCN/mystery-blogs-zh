I don't think this can actually bind a person's magick. Magick is a natural gift, and at best this will take away a person's will to perform magick. The person will grow bored or tired of it, and will ultimately give it up. Translation of chants (google translate was used, so not sure how reliable this is):- ''Satan, I beg you, you shall bind this person. They help me, oh Lord thy My staff is my tool to assist me to arrest this fool The end of the night''
