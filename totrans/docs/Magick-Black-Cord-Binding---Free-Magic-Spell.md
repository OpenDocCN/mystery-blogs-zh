 ## Casting Instructions for 'Magick Black Cord Binding'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Black cord-long enough to tie 3 knots in it

*   A photo of the person harming others

 First of all sit and cast circle. Explain to the universe what you are about to do and ask if it is the right thing. Think about how the person is hurting others and let the anger build up. Then all at once say loudly: "(person's name) I bind you from hurting others!" Then quickly tie a knot tightly in the cord.

Repeat the process three times or as many times you feel necessary. When done, say: "Three times three, I bind you (person's name)!" Hide the cord and photo in a safe place where the knots won't come undone. Or better still, burn the cord so the knots never come undone.

After explaining and asking to the universe, What should I do if I don't get any answers? What if the universe says that this is not the right thing to do? Whisper?
