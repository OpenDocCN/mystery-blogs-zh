This is a purification spell to help you get rid of any negative energy that might be lurking about your body. You need the following herbal supplies:

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Personal Purification Bath'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Anise seed

*   Fennel

*   Rosemary

*   White sage

*   Hyssop

*   Cedar oil

*   A square of cheesecloth

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Anise seed

*   Fennel

*   Rosemary

*   White sage

*   Hyssop

*   Cedar oil

*   A square of cheesecloth

You'll want about a tablespoon of each one of the herbs, but the exact measurements aren't important. In a small bowl, mix all the herbs together and then drip a few drops of cedar oil onto the mixture. Give it another stir, and bundle it up in the cheesecloth. Next time you need a purification bath, add this herbal charm to the water as your bath is filling up.

Don't add any other bath products and allow yourself about an hour to soak in the herb-soaked water. It will clear away any negative energy around you. Dispose of the bag after your bath (don't use the same herbs for another bath, in other words).
