You’ve probably heard of crystal balls and tarot cards, but have you ever explored the enigmatic world of black mirror scrying? Often seen as mysterious or even spooky, black mirror scrying is actually an ancient art of divination that dates back thousands of years. For those curious about what it entails and how to dive into this mystical practice, you’ve come to the right place. We’re going to unpack everything you need to know about black mirror scrying: its history, its methods, and some useful tips for beginners.

## What Is Black Mirror Scrying?

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let’s quickly recap what black mirror scrying is. It’s a form of divination that employs a black mirror as a focal point to induce a meditative or trance-like state. By gazing into the mirror, practitioners claim to tap into deeper levels of consciousness, leading to visions or insights.

Basically, black mirror scrying will be very similar to scrying with a regular mirror, only you’ll be using a black, shiny surface.

There are many kinds of black mirrors you can use. The most typical is made like a regular mirror with black backing instead of silver. Some are available for purchase custom-made ([these are my favorite ones on Etsy](https://rstyle.me/+kTgMUMDvECOsLtilXiOYtg)) but you can also use an obsidian crystal or make your own.

In general, you can [search black mirrors on Etsy](https://rstyle.me/+2w63xe8TghIHfZrd-tINbw) and find a whole bunch of options in each price range.

You can also [use an obsidian crystal ball](https://rstyle.me/+1LS3kOApE0QxPy4422AyfA) instead of a black mirror for similar effects.

Lastly, you can make your own, which we will discuss further on in this post.

## The History of Black Mirror Scrying

The history of black mirror scrying is deep-rooted and crosses multiple cultures. It can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Celts. The Egyptians, for instance, used dark, polished surfaces like obsidian for divinatory practices. Nostradamus is said to have used a black mirror to foresee events. Even today, it holds a place in various esoteric traditions, including modern Wicca and other pagan practices.

## Why Use a Black Mirror?

Black mirrors are believed to help minimize distractions. Their dark surface limits reflections, creating a void-like focal point that aids in achieving a meditative state, which can be difficult with a regular mirror and a lot of light.

**More specifically, black mirror scrying is great when you want to see into darker realms, connect with Chthonic deities, or communicate with your unconscious mind.** All things darker are easily accessed through a black mirror. Note that darker doesn’t mean back – it’s simply a different kind of energy. I use black mirror scrying quite often in [Qliphothic work](https://teaandrosemary.com/the-qliphoth-tree/) because it’s the perfect association for the void.

When you scry using a black mirror, the key is to shift your gaze slightly beyond the mirror’s physical surface. Think of the mirror as a gateway to an unspecified realm that lies beyond it; this will help your mind naturally enter the required state for effective scrying.

For optimal results, use soft, dim, and indirect lighting—just a couple of candles should do the trick. Hold the mirror flat and directly in front of you in such a way that you don’t see your own reflection, but instead are met with a vague, dark expanse.

## How to Scry Using a Black Mirror

### Step 1: Prepare the Space

As always, you’ll want a quiet, dimly lit room. Add additional elements that resonate with the cthonic entity you wish to contact. This could be specific incense, symbols, or even ritual objects. You can also add in mechanisms for trance such as drums, music, or [flying ointment](https://rstyle.me/+UAPmTmsnuTS9sAhdiqwZDg). 

Tilt the mirror so that you can’t see anything in the room around you. You may need to play with the angle to get minimal reflections.

### Step 2: Ground Yourself and Open the Circle

Take a few deep breaths and center yourself. If you’ve chosen to create a protective circle, this is the time to do it.

### Step 3: Evocation or Statement of Intent

Before you start scrying, have a question or an intent in mind. It could be something like, “What should I focus on in the coming month?” or simply an intent to gain clarity on a situation.

Clearly state your intention or perform your evocation to call upon the entity you wish to communicate with. 

An evocation can be as simple as: “Deity, I call you forth into this mirror,” or can be multiple paragraphs long.

### Step 4: Begin Scrying

Gaze softly into the black mirror, allowing your vision to blur. Keep your mind open to receive any messages, images, or feelings. It can help to try and enter an altered state of consciousness at this time. This can include listening to trance drums, [using flying ointment](https://rstyle.me/+UAPmTmsnuTS9sAhdiqwZDg), or simply going into trance by softening your gaze for long enough.

While you’re scrying, you may see images or get certain feelings. Pay attention to everything that happens and don’t worry if you don’t physically see the deity pop up in the mirror like Snow White. It’s really important to look at the subtleties here because that’s how many messages are communicated.

### Step 5: Closing the Session

Once you feel the session is over or you have received the guidance you were looking for, remember to thank the entity. Close the protective circle if you opened one and take a few moments to ground yourself.

Over the next few days, you may notice effects from the session, such as big things in your life changing (often specific to the deity’s realm of influence).

## Tips for Black Mirror Scrying Beginners

**Be Patient:** Scrying often requires practice. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t get significant insights right away.

**Notice Subtleties:** Often, deities will communicate through subtle feelings/impressions or symbols that pop up in the mirror. If you see an image in the mirror and something immediately pops into your head, write it down – that’s important.

**Keep Records:** Maintain a journal of your scrying experiences to track your progress and interpret patterns.

## How To Make Your Own Black Mirror For Scrying

If you’re planning to scry using a handmade black mirror, there are several guidelines you should consider when making your own. Firstly, opt for a round or oval mirror instead of a square one. I personally love vintage frames. 

You’ll need this picture frame and a can of matte black spray paint. Remove the glass and clean both sides thoroughly, making sure they’re completely dry. Hold the spray can about 20 inches away from the glass and lightly spray just one side, moving the can side-to-side to ensure an even coat. Allow the paint to dry before adding additional layers.

Once the paint is dry, hold the glass up to a light source to ensure it’s fully opaque. Place the glass back into the frame, making sure the unpainted side faces outward. Keep your mirror pristine; even a tiny smudge or fingerprint can be a distraction while scrying. 

You’ll probably want to consecrate or dedicate the mirror before you begin scrying. Keep it in a safe place and keep it covered when not in use.

## FAQs About Black Mirror Scrying:

Here are some of the most common questions and answers when learning how to scry with a black mirror.

### Can I Use Any Mirror for Scrying?

While you can technically use any mirror, a black mirror is recommended for scrying because its dark surface helps to minimize distractions, allowing for a deeper meditative state. Opting for a round or oval-shaped mirror is also suggested for better results.

### Is Scrying Safe?

Scrying itself is generally considered safe, but it’s crucial to exercise caution, particularly when attempting to communicate with entities. It’s recommended to set up a protective circle and be clear with your intentions to ensure a secure scrying experience.

### What Kind of Lighting is Best for Scrying?

**S**oft, low, indirect lighting is best for scrying. A couple of candles are usually sufficient. Avoid bright or harsh lighting, as it can be distracting and counterproductive.

### How Long Does a Scrying Session Last?

The duration of a scrying session can vary depending on the practitioner and the specific goals of the session. It could last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. Listen to your intuition; when you feel you’ve received enough information, it’s time to close the session.

### Can I Scry with Other People?

Yes, you can scry with other people, but make sure they are also focused and respectful of the ritual. If someone else is looking into the mirror, they should also be partaking in the scrying process to maintain the session’s integrity, or you probably won’t have any deities show up.

### What Should I Do If I Don’t See Anything?

It’s completely normal not to see anything during your first few attempts at scrying. The process often requires practice and patience. Pay attention to any feelings or impressions, as those usually come first. Don’t be discouraged; continue to hone your skills, and with time, you may start to see visions or gain insights.

### Can I Use Black Mirror Scrying to Communicate with Specific Entities?

Yes, black mirror scrying can be used to communicate with specific spiritual entities, including chthonic deities and demons. You’ll need to write an evocation ahead of time to evoke a specific deity or demon.

### Do I Need to Cleanse the Mirror After Scrying?

It’s a good idea to cleanse your black mirror after each scrying session. You can use sage smoke, moonlight, or other cleansing methods to remove any residual energies.

### Can I Record My Scrying Sessions?

Yes, you can record your scrying sessions, either by jotting down notes immediately afterward or by using an audio recording device. However, try not to let the act of recording distract you during the session itself.

### Can Scrying Predict the Future?

While some people use scrying as a form of divination to gain insights into future events, it’s crucial to approach such interpretations cautiously. Scrying doesn’t guarantee exact predictions, and it’s essential to use your discretion when acting on any visions or messages received. More often, when you see a future event, you’re tapping into your subconscious beliefs *about* the future, since it’s not set in stone.

### Should I Fast Before Scrying?

Fasting is not strictly necessary but can help some people achieve a deeper state of focus and spiritual connection. If you choose to fast, make sure it’s done safely and consult a healthcare provider if you have any medical conditions. Personally, I don’t fast and I perform black mirror scrying just fine.

### Is It Normal to Feel Drained After Scrying?

It’s not uncommon to feel mentally or emotionally drained after a deep scrying session. Make sure to ground yourself afterward, perhaps by eating something or spending time in nature. Basically, you’ll want to go back to the mundane world and do something *normal*.
