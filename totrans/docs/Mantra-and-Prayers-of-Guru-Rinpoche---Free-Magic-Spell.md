# Mantra and Prayers of Guru Rinpoche

Guru Rinpoche(also known as Padmasambhava) was a guru who brought Tantric Buddhism to Tibet. The mantra is to not only protect you, but is said to grant wishes. One of the prayers(which I will describe in the instructions) is to remove all obstacles and is wish fulling. The other one which is the seven line prayer of Guru Rinpoche is an invocation of the Guru.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Mantra and Prayers of Guru Rinpoche'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** **Guru Rinpoche's Mantra**
"Om Ah hum Vajra Guru Padma Siddhi Hum." That is the Sanskrit version. The Tibetan version goes as: "Om Ah hum Banzara Guru Pema Siddhi Hum" . It is best to chant this mantra for at least one mala or 108 times. Do this with faith and belief. If you can, you could also do this while looking at a picture of Guru Padmasambhava Rinpoche.

**The Seven Line Prayer of Guru Rinpoche**
An invocation of summoning him and honoring him which goes as: "Hung orgyen yul gyi nubjang tsam Pema gesar dongpo la Yatsen chok gi ngödrub nyé Pema jungné shyé su drak Khor du khandro mangpö kor Khyé kyi jesu dak drub kyi Jingyi lab chir shek su sol Guru Pema Siddhi Hung."

**Prayer of Guru Padmasambhava Rinpoche**
A prayer that removes obstacles. It's usually known as "The Prayer to Guru Rinpoche for Removing Obstacles and Fulfilling Wishes". It goes as: "Dü Sum Sangyé Guru Rinpoché Ngödrup Kun Dak Déwa Chenpö Shyap Barché Kun Sel Düd Dul Drakpo Tsal Solwa Depso Chingyi Lap Tu Sol Chi Nang Sangwé Barché Shyiwa Dang Sampa Lhun Gyi Druppar Chin Gyi Lop" This is to be chanted as much as you feel like it should be chanted. Though when chanting this prayer, be compassionate. If you are compassionate, you will succeed.
