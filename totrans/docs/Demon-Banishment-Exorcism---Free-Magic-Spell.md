How important is the correct pronunciation of this? I do not know Latin. Will the spell still work if pronounced incorrectly?

I doubt this actually work but that's more personal opinion. If you don't speak Latin and don't know what you're saying it kind of defeats the whole ''have conviction in your words'' which the spell insists on. If you ronounce it incorrectly or stumble over words the spell won't be as powerful because you had to stop and start, or misspoke because, again, you don't speak Latin so you could be ordering food for all you know.

In spell casting you must get the pronounciations absolutely correct. In Latin simularly spelled words can have very different meanings. You dont want to be trying to bannish a demon using the words to order a pizza ya know.

i think the demand of departure from fosforos works better but you need to know the name of the one your talking to [Spirit], I thank you that you have heard my calling and approached us. Now, my many thanks with you, you are free to go: return to your freedom and into that current out of which you were drawn by my will. May the waters turn to their channels. Let there be no wrath but peace between us, the servants of the one and only God. I thank you; go. or if you speak latin Leay yli ziarite zelohave et negoramy zien latebm dama mecha ra meti ozira. Ite in pace a loca vostra et pax inter vos, redituri ad me quum vos invocavero, in nomine Patris, & Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen, Amen, Ameth. exceptions stated hear. When the time chosen for the calling has passed, the Command of Departure is read irrespective of how the spirits have answered. The wording of the beginning can be changed depending whether one or more spirits have been summoned, or if it is used to banish spirits that the magician has not conjured: the names of distinct spirits can be dropped, if the banishment is of a common kind.

This is what the spell is translated to: ''Kingdoms of the earth, chanted God Sing Cernunnos. Kingdoms; chanted Dea Sing Arad. Heaven, The earth, humbly by the majesty of your glory: we pray you. In order that from every power of the infernal spirits, from their The trap and corrupt practices. Every deceit, free us dominates. Exorcise you every impure. Every satanic power every incursion of the, of the Hellish opposed to me. Every legion, every congregation and diabolical sect. From the snares, deliver us dominates. To coven may serve you liberty to do. Beseech thee to hear us! In order to crush down the enemies of holy ring. Beseech thee to hear us! terrible His sanctuary; Cernunnos the thrust power to his people; Arad the strength of his people. Blessed be God, the Father, Blessed Goddess Mother of Glory! ''

also if you do try and do it usually you need permission from a priest of some sort usually catholic guy

You can say this in other languages too. For example, my national language is portuguese so if i want, i translate this spell to portuguese.

This spell somons the demon blasphomy

If you spoke Latin you would know that this doesn't summon anything, least of all demonic forces.

Why would it end Blessed Goddess, mother of glory if it were a Christian based spell?

It means:Kingdoms; chanted God Sing Cernunnos. Kingdoms; chanted Dea Sing Arad. Heaven, The earth, humbly by the majesty of your glory: we pray you. In order that from every power of the infernal spirits, from their The trap and corrupt practices. Every deceit, free us dominates. Exorcise you every impure. Every satanic power every incursion of the, of the Hellish opposed to me. Every legion, every congregation and diabolical sect. From the snares, deliver us dominates. To coven may serve you liberty to do. Beseech thee to hear us! In order to crush down the enemies of holy ring. Beseech thee to hear us! terrible His sanctuary; Cernunnos the thrust power to his people; Arad the strength of his people. Blessed be God, the Father, Blessed Goddess Mother of Glory! ''

Google translate is awesome

Google translate is notoriously unreliable for latin, just so u know

Why did I feel the spell was doing something to me?

Maybe you were affected because of the words?

This here is the article translated from google. Sounds more like a prayer then a banishing to me. ''Kingdoms of the earth, chanted God Sing Cernunnos. Kingdoms; chanted Dea Sing Arad. Heaven, The earth, humbly by the majesty of your glory: we pray you. In order that from every power of the infernal spirits, from their The trap and corrupt practices. Every deceit, free us dominates. Exorcise you every impure. Every satanic power every incursion of the, of the Hellish opposed to me. Every legion, every congregation and diabolical sect. From the snares, deliver us dominates. To coven may serve you liberty to do. Beseech thee to hear us! In order to crush down the enemies of holy ring. Beseech thee to hear us! terrible His sanctuary; Cernunnos the thrust power to his people; Arad the strength of his people. Blessed be God, the Father, Blessed Goddess Mother of Glory! ''

By my understanding, most banishings are prayers. The idea is to ask for benediction or authority over a being or place in the name of a higher power. To call on their will and authority and to ask for the presence of a higher being (or beings) to act through you and sanctify a place, make it sacred, and make any oppositional beings unwelcome.

This seems legit to me. I have yet to test it out on my possessed friend.

Did anyone else copy and paste this on google translate to hear it in English 😂

how did you know the translation

I think google translate or they speak latin

demons have obvious english names hate war death pain agony torture if you know there name you have power over them

Demons do not wish to harm others. They are friendly spirits and I am not talking about the silly goetia crap. The real demons who actually followed Lucifer in the beginning. It is known for angels to pretend to be demons.

From my interaction with demons, they aren't the evil beings most assume, but they aren't nice either. They can be manipulative, you do need to have some knowledge of what you're doing because they will exploit those who don't have some footing. They're like the fae, some want nothing to do with humans, some don't mind helping for a trade, but most are observant and won't seek you out, you'll have to talk to them.

it wont work you need to have permission from a priest to do an exorsim which is basicly what this is and never do so if you cant speak latin properly also the spelling of some of the word are inccorect

Priests can perform exorcisms but it's not exclusive to the catholic church. This spell specifically, I doubt how well it works, and if you're not fluent in a language like Latin, it's more of a hindrance using it in a spell. I wouldn't seek out a demon to attempt this spell, and if you're Christian and dealing with demons, contact a priest. But, if you're not Christian and have a demon problem, you can still banish them, but this won't do it.

I came close to being possesed once, the lights turned on by themselves and when going into the room there was a heavy scense of dread in the air. i started to find it hard to breathe and the temprature changed dramatically and when i left the room i was touched on the spine but it was as if something went inside me from then on i felt as if i was in a trance and all the life was sucked out of me making me feel ill and uncomfortable. i found it hard to laugh or speak and started to see black spots all around me i could still feel where it went inside me like a strong ache all the while there was a stench that went throughout the house like corpses or vomit. After that i felt like i was being watched and could sometimes see a black figure out of the corner of my eye and occasionaly being touched i also started thiinking dark thoughts but i tried to stay positive and went to get reiki, the practitioner said they took alot of dark negative energy from me that had seemed to attach itself. from then on i used black tourmaline and hematite to ward myself however i still see moving shadows occasionally in the house i just wish i had that incantation then

This works good did you right the spell yourself

Trying it to see how it works

This spell is good for sure dr should use it the evil sounds will go away

Great spell works for me everytime

This will work, but so will enough physical damage

Love and respect. Some of these Latin chants specially nowdays presented easily to the public and the non-professional practitioners will not only not work but perhaps worsen the situation for many of them are set by demonic commanders and their human agents. Hearing it from an international mature and experiences all-around (well most-around to be precise) practitioner (no bragging, just to legiticise the point fir I am super certain about it and have personally attained results): If you want real healing results on an exorcism ooeration the language you would want to work with is Arabic, and if you do not make clishe' assumptions also the holy book to work with is the holy Quran of the Islam religion..

Your belief may be to follow Islam, but that doesn't make it the absolute truth. It is your truth, which only matters to you.

User652302, its operation by the way (not being rude, just correcting!).
