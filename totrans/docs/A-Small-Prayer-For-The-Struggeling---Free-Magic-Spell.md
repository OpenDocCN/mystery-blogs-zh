This leans towards Christian crisis of faith more than any faith. This might work for some, but I doubt it would work for most. Meditate, pray, soul search, journal, nature walks, study religions, talking to a spiritual leader, these things can help with a crisis of faith. If you want to ask God for direction, this works too, but this spell will not instantly work for everyone. Take time to look inward as well as ask the divine for guidance.
