To be spoken aloud by a single operant whilst all operators slowly spin widdershins, with eyes wide open and arms outstretched. Operators visualize a sphere of dense black, smoky darkness enveloping the area surrounding them as the Enochian invocation is delivered:

URANUN CARIPE BAGLEN OL
GEMEGANZA DE-NOAN CHIIS GOSAA
ZAMICMAGE OLEOL AG-SAPAH ARPHE
ORESA ETHAMZ TAA TABEGISOROCH
ZODINU AR ZURAH PAREMU
ZODIMIBE PAPNORGE MANINUA
ZONAC DODSIH HOXMARCH TRIAN
AMONONS PARE DAS NIIS KURES

Translated:

Visible only by will, I blind and make deaf all others who may see or hear me.
A darkness shall cover them like that at the bottom of the ocean,
and they shall leave immediately.
Forgetfulness will envelope their minds and anxiety grip their hearts
should they come to interrupt us in our work.

The operators then see the smoky darkness dissipate as all that is within the working area begins to ''fold''. The unfolding process is completed by laughter whilst spinning quickly deosil, high speed, to a full stop.

I never studied Enochian, so I am unfamiliar with that path. You should understand the language if you wish to convey it, otherwise, you could be calling on something completely different. This will not make you physically invisible, but it could bless you with protection from those who wish to harm you and that caused your enemies to overlook you.
