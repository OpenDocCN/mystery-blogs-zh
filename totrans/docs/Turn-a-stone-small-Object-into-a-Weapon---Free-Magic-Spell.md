This does not work. Magik will not transform an object into something else. You can call on Ares for protection if you are defending yourself. He will not change a rock into a gun. Furthermore, ''amen'' is an Abrahamic prayer blessing, it means nothing to Hellenic deities or any witch who does not work with Yahweh. It is specific to the Abrahamic path. If you use it in your path, that is fine, but in terms of most Pagan paths, it is not.

Push the stone in'' Whey does this mean?

It doesn't matter, since the spells is completely pretend, and such physical transformations of objects are not possible.
