Catholic or not they're dead and you can't make them undead. Take some solace they're in heaven.

Why must it about heaven? through in many ancient pantheon, there always gods/goddess of the underworld. and 'clouds of heaven'? if you mean above.. in outer space there is no clouds. Also 'in your heart' , you want a pet inside your microcosmos?. Also too 'your left chest'? why it is not right chest? well, energy and spirit could be everywhere, and not attached on left chest only. Maybe in once a year, gates is open, thats why we see ''hungry Ghost festival'', ''Yulanpen Sutra'' in asian or ''Halloween'' in.. , these gates is allowed (by gods) to be open between the dead and alive but just for a while, to not disturb the balance.

You cannot bring someone back from the dead. While I doubt this even works, it could call to their spirit. They will not physically return to life.

Not only will the spell not work but you spelled Catholic wrong

i can say this spell is fake and may not even work it might call for their spirit but you cannot bring someone or something back to life when it is dead sorry.
