Pluto-Sun aspects are super intense. Both people have a deep fascination with each other.

Generally, the Sun person will think that the Pluto person is mesmerizing. Both people will sense a strong magnetism and attraction between each other.

Although some astrologers believe that the Pluto person has the upper hand, I have found that the opposite can be true, too. This will depend a lot on the sign that the planets are in. For example, a Scorpio Sun is more likely to handle the Pluto person easily than a Pisces Sun.

### Pluto Conjunct Sun Synastry

The Pluto conjunct Sun synastry aspect makes for a *really* deep and magnetic relationship. The couple is quickly drawn to each other and feels a deep energetic bond that is emotionally and physically charged.

Often, the Pluto conjunct Sun synastry aspect means that there are *many* power struggles in the relationship. Both people will try to keep the upper hand.

Sometimes, the Pluto person is more “in charge” of the relationship. The Pluto person tends to like the Sun person’s strengths, but they can also feel threatened by the brightness of the Sun person.

The Pluto person can also feel overwhelmed by the Sun person’s enthusiasm. The Pluto person may be a bit more withdrawn or deep, while the Sun person is active and energetic.

The Sun individual may feel like they need to change their personality to make the Pluto person happy. Keep in mind that this depends *a lot* on the Sun sign.

With the Pluto conjunct Sun synastry aspect, there is almost nothing hidden in the relationship. This is the couple that can’t keep secrets from each other, even if this openness ends up being harmful.

The Pluto conjunct Sun synastry relationship has constant sexual tension. Each person is extremely attracted to each other, but it’s not a fluffy physical attraction.

Instead, this sexual attraction is magnetic and can even feel a bit dark or obsessive. There may be a constant sense of sexual tension.

Sometimes with the Pluto conjunct Sun synastry aspect, the Pluto person can go through a spiritual awakening due to the Sun person. This is because the Sun individual “shines their light” on the Pluto person’s darkest spots.

However, the Sun person can also learn to accept their shadow side because of the Pluto individual. In any Pluto conjunct Sun synastry relationship, the Sun person will be transformed, for better or worse.

Ultimately, this aspect creates a huge amount of charged, tense energy. It’s up to the couple to use this energy for positive, transformative purposes. It’s definitely a difficult aspect, but it can change both people for the better.

### Pluto Trine Sun Synastry

The Pluto trine Sun synastry aspect makes for a relationship that is passionate and intense right off the bat. Both people are attracted to each other, even from across the room.

This relationship is physically *and* emotionally intense. The couple will be fascinated with each other and will want to know everything about each other.

The Pluto trine Sun synastry relationship is extremely transformative, but it’s a bit less painful than other Pluto aspects because of the trine. This transformation happens naturally and may seem “meant to be.”

This couple will be supportive and encouraging towards each other. The Pluto trine Sun synastry aspect makes the relationship positive and powerful, with each person making the other feel more self-confident. 

This relationship indicates mutual transformation. Each person will grow and transform, discovering new depths inside of themselves with the help of the other.

Sometimes, the Pluto person is more realistic than the Sun individual. The Sun person may prefer to live in fantasy, while the Pluto person has to focus on what’s right in front of them. They help to ground the Sun individual.

The Pluto person will help the sun become their true outer, conscious self, while the Sun person will help the Pluto individual delve into the inner, subconscious mind.

The couple will have a strong sexual bond, too. It can be hard for them each to resist each other, especially at first. Their sex life will be deep and meaningful.

This is the ultimate commitment aspect! It keeps both people in the relationship wanting more.

Ultimately, the Pluto trine Sun synastry aspect creates a deep, magnetic bond that contributes to personal growth. This is a harmonic aspect, although it is charged, and is relatively seamless in a relationship.

### Pluto Sextile Sun Synastry

The Pluto sextile Sun synastry aspect gives both individuals the opportunity to learn about themselves through this relationship. It can be a truly transformative partnership, if the couple is able to do the inner work.

Sometimes, the Pluto person feels as though the Sun person has shined a light on their darkest spots. This is painful, but is also something they may want to hold onto, because it helps them discover more about who they truly are.

With this Pluto sextile Sun synastry aspect, there is a mutual fascination between the couple. They both want to know more about the deepest parts of the other person’s mind. 

Each person is sensitive to the other because there is a natural understand of their emotions. Sometimes, they can almost be too sensitive to each other and may walk on eggshells.

Keep in mind that sextiles aren’t stabilizing on their own. This aspect will need other supportive aspects in the chart that are a bit stronger, but this can definitely contribute to the relationship.

The sextile here is an aspect that supports both people diving into deeper levels of themselves, it adds a supportive highlight and theme of exploring the deeper waters of experience through your connection!

Between the partners, the Pluto sextile Sun synastry aspect creates a relationship that is passionate, sexual, and emotional. If both people are willing to dive into the uncomfortable sides of their unconscious minds, then they can learn and grow by being together.

However, this relationship can also turn obsessive or controlling if either person is unwilling to examine their own subconscious mind. Be careful that, in the Pluto sextile Sun synastry relationship, you focus on yourself as much as you focus on the other person.

### Pluto Opposition Sun Synastry

The Pluto opposition Sun synastry aspect creates a truly transformative relationship, like most Pluto-Sun aspects. However, it can be a bit of a love-hate relationship.

You may experience emotions you have never before felt in this relationship. These feelings can be both negative and positive.

The relationship with the Pluto opposition Sun synastry aspect can be filled with power struggles. You might try to dominate each other in many different ways.

However, there is also an element of obsession. You want to know every detail about the other person’s mind and may come to feel possessive of your partner.

This is the relationship that ends in destruction. It will be very difficult to remain friends or have positive feelings towards your partner should the relationship end.

The Pluto opposition Sun synastry aspect indicates that if you are able to transform together, there will be a lot of tension along the way. In some manner, you are total opposites.

This is a karmic aspect. Although this relationship is fated, it can also end quite badly, creating more karma. 

The goal is to find understand in your alternate archetypes. You are polar opposites, but this means that you both have the chance to grow.

Be careful that, with the Pluto opposition Sun synastry aspect, you don’t fall into obsession. It’s easy to feel enthralled by each other while also hating each.

Ultimately, you with both need to experience an ego death, although this may be tougher for the Sun. This is a very tricky placement, but can also be quite transformational over the long run.

### Pluto Square Sun Synastry

With the Pluto square Sun synastry aspect, you have a deep and transformative effect on each other. Just like the opposition, it can be a bit of a love-hate relationship.

This aspect creates a lot of power struggles. You might try to dominate each other in the relationship.

The Pluto square Sun synastry aspect can indicate obsession, too. You might want to know every detail about each other’s lives or even thoughts. 

Sometimes, this relationship can turn extremely possessive or controlling. However, Pluto square Sun in synastry is also super sexual.

You can be deeply attached to each other both emotionally and sexually. Your passion stems from this aspect, so it’s a bit chaotic and charged instead of easy and harmonious.

However, the Pluto square Sun synastry aspect *can* work in a long-term relationship. You will encounter a lot of emotional chaos. If both people want to change and are willing to work through this, then both partners will see a lot of personal *and* relationship transformation.

The Pluto square Sun synastry aspect is all about wild ups and downs. You will know that you’re making progress when your relationship becomes more steady.

Both partners need to be wary of trying to control the other. These impulses are a sign that something needs to be worked through, so don’t ignore the need for control, but don’t succumb to it, either.

Sometimes, therapy or emotional work can be quite helpful with the Pluto square Sun synastry aspect.
