You can not grow physical wings.

you acctualy do not have proof, did u know? you might have read it somewhere but who found out that its not real. dont ruin others dreams. please.

Have you ever seen someone, in person, with physical angel wings? Magic is a natural force that brings natural change to the natural world. Humans bones are nothing like bird bones, they are too tick while birds are hollow, and we lack the joints cabable for winged flight, therefore this spell does not work.

Tadashi, I have actually seen someone with wings. There are people out there whove succeeded in spells like these

You have not, as Tadashi said it's not possible through magick or nature. Human bones and bird bones are completely different, we don't have the joints required for wings, and above all just saying ''I saw someone'' isn't proof. Those of us explaining real magick to you have provided proof and explained why pretty clearly, you simply going ''no, I saw it'' doesn't prove anything.

Tadashi and Nekoshema is absolutely correct. Sorry darlings, but witches are humans and we can't change that. The human anatomy and bird anatomy are completely different, as Nekoshema said. Magick isn't like the magick you see in shows and movies, it requires studying and such. And magick stills applies to science
