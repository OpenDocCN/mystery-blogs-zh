 Pin one piece of flannel atop the other. Draw a simple outline of a human body on the top piece to serve as a pattern. Cut out the 2 figures. Sew the 2 pieces of flannel together, leaving a small opening at the head. Do not add features or identifying information. This is NOT an attempt at sex, it's merely an anonymous return-to-sender, who ever or what ever the sender might be.

Stuff with sharp plants. Sew up the hole. Write "Return To Sender" on a tiny piece of paper and pin it to the poppet. Talk to the doll, charge it with it's mission. Take it to the trash can a distance from your home and throw it away, or leave it in the center of a four way crossroads, not too close to your home.
