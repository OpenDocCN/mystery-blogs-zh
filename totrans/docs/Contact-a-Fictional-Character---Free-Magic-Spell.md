 ## Casting Instructions for 'Contact a Fictional Character'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Paper

*   A pencil, pen, marker, crayon, quill, any writing material you prefer

*   A picture or description of the character

*   An item you associate with the character

 Note: in order to do this you have to have an emotional connection to a character.

First, write down the characters name on the paper. Next, read the description of your character or look at the picture of the character. Focus all your energy onto them. Think of them. Then write on the paper a question. Listen for the character's response.

If you can't hear them, then hold the item or think about a moment with the character that you like. Try to mentally talk to the character. If this doesn't work you can also try meditation or try again later. Like most things, it doesn't always happen on the first try.

Also note that when you hear them it'll be spiritually/mentally. They are from another universe and they can't physically appear.

What if I don't have any items of them? And how do I know that if I hear an answer it isn't my thoughts faking to be their voice? Thank you. :)

They do not exist, you cannot contact them. You could call on the archetype for guidance, or create a servitor to advise you as they would, but this is your subconscious, not the actual character.
