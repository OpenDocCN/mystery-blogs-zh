# Avian Metality meditation

This is in testing so I'm not sure if it will work. This does not give you wings or make you an avian. It gives you a good mindset to be an avian. You won't see your results because they are not phisical.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Avian Metality meditation'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Clear mind

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Clear mind

*   Things that make you feel peaceful

*   Quiet room

*   Time

*   Anything you think will help

 To start rest for at least 5 minutes or until your mind is clear. You will need to be quiet and patient for this. Sit down in a quiet room with no distractions and get comfortable. Close your eyes. Picture yourself above the world playing with birds free. Picture yourself growing and using your wings. Be realistic about these wings. Don't think about anything unnatural like pink fairy wings but rather something realistic. As you picture yourself flying, think about how they feel. What kind of wings are they? Falcon? Hawk? Robin? The list goes on but what's important is that you know all about them. Once you do this, picture the wind in your face, making your eyes water. They in your mind, don't stop the wind but make yourself resistant to it. Again picture yourself flying and acting as if you were meant to have wings. Do and repeat this for a long time. Then you should let your mind go blank and think about nothing, open your eyes. There is your meditation. Remember this is still in testing and it won't give you wings but give you an avian mindset so don't comment about that. Peace out!

Pro: they stressed this will not give you physical wings. Con: I am unsure what the point of this is. It says you are giving you the mindset to have wings, but you cannot grow physical wings, so is it a mental shift or an astral one? It appears harmless enough, so if someone wishes to try it themselves, go for it, but I do not think it will do much of anything.
