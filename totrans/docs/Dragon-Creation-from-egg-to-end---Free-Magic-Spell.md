# Dragon Creation from egg to end

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This will make the dream dragon you have always wanted. It will be hopefully on the physical realm. So enjoy the spell. I won't guarantee that you will get a dragon.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Paper

*   Pen/Pencil

*   Crayons/Colored Pencils

*   Ruler(needs to have 12inches or a tape measure

## Casting Instructions for 'Dragon Creation from egg to end'

Read the following before you get started.

.Draw what your dragon will look like.
.Color your dragon according to it?s element or just color your dragon then find out its element by its color.
.Draw you next to your dragon. The dragon will be that much taller/ smaller than you.
.Right down your height next to you.
.Color yourself (optional)
.Make lines to the top of your body according to your height. (example: five feet. Draw five equal lines.)
.Now continue to make your dragon?s height. The top of the dragon?s shoulders are its height. Not the head.
.Underline the heights of you and your dragon.
.Fold paper hamburger style. So you can?t see your drawing. Fold it only once
.Now write its info with a pencil on either side. (Name, Scale color, wings, tail, Accessories, strength, behavior, abilities, element, dragon breed, eyes, what it eats, etc.)
.Fold paper hamburger style again so you can?t see the words.
.Now write this and say it as you write it allowed: (it?s element) dragon of mine, come to me, by egg of (its element again). I summon the newborn mythical creature. So mote it be. (?So mote it be? should be written as big as you can.)
.Now fold it hamburger style so you can?t see the words.
.Make a pentagram on one side.
.Fold it once more.
.Now every night, before you sleep, chant: God/ Goddesses, grant my dream dragon in the real world from egg to end
.Kiss the paper after you chanted and put it under your pillow.
.As you fall asleep, dream of you and your dragon coming together.

If you stop in the middle, just simply read what you have. You need actual belief in dragons or else you will not get an egg.

type of eggs:
Water= sitting in the pool (if you have one)/blue egg
Earth=rock egg
Fire= flaming egg/ red egg
Air/Wind= maybe invisible and strong wind comes/ white egg
Snow= comes in winter time/white-blue coloring
Metal= metal egg
Silver= silver egg
Copper= copper egg
Nature= colorful (I?m not sure)
There are more egg types but I don?t have them in mind now. So, if you have any other sort of element, please message me.

Let me know if the spell works. I'm currently using this spell. Also, it's best to make your dragon's main abilities to be able to phase through your dragon (if not wanted to be touched), invisibility, and telepathy. Also, don't make your dragon invincible. The spell won't work if you do that. This spell is meant to be good and not bad. Once you find the dragon egg, keep in eye on it. Hopefully, your egg will hatch within a week or so. Now I involved some things that I thought will work cause they seem to be in a lot of places on the site. Your dragon egg should be in your back yard. If you don't have a back yard, then it should appear in your room or on the balcony. I'll edit this if I find out it works. Let me know if you guys get an egg. I will make an instruction on what to do once you get an egg. Once one person messages me, I'll set up an instruction on how to care for the dragon. You are only allowed to get one dragon. I'll also tell you what you dragon is if it has more than one element. Like mine, hopefully, will be a Silverwind breed. That's Silver and Wind dragon. I will be naming your breed. If you have anymore questions, message me.

Has this spell worked for anyone? also will the dragon be seen by others or just me?

Dragons are not real so it won't work

You can't make a Dragon. They're astral beings you can work with, but you can't create one. At best you can make a thoughtform in the shape of a Dragon, but it won't be an actual Dragon, just your energy in the shape of one.
