# Athena’s Devotional Prayer for Wisdom – Spells8

> 来源：[https://spells8.com/athena-devotional/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/athena-devotional/#0001-01-01)

Athena is the Greek goddess of wisdom, strategy and just war. She was considered a mentor of heroes and worshiped as patroness of Athens, where the Parthenon was built to worship her. She was associated by the Etruscans with its goddess Menrva, and later by the Romans with [Minerva](https://spells8.com/minerva-devotional/).

Only-begotten, noble race of Zeus,

Blessed and fierce, who joyest in caves to rove:

O, warlike Athena, whose illustrious kind,

Ineffable and effable we find:

Magnanimous and famed, the rocky height,

And groves, and shady mountains thee delight:

In arms rejoicing, who with Furies dire

And wild, the souls of mortals dost inspire.

Gymnastic virgin of terrific mind,

Dire Gorgon’s bane, unmarried, blessed, kind:

Mother of arts, impetuous; understood,

Rage to the wicked, wisdom to the good.

I ask for your Wisdom to let go

Of the bad habits that interrupt my empathy with the gods.

Help me in this process to improve every day.

Renew me, cleanse me, purify me, Athena.

Let my actions speak louder than my words.

Help me choose the people that come to my life.

Help me to be tolerant, understanding and to learn to live in peace,

with understanding, intelligence, love and respect.

Today I consecrate my whole being to you,

I let your influence be my guide, my counselor.

I want to share your wisdom with those around me,

So they can find good advice when they need it.

Help me fulfill my obligations with excellence.

As this will preserve my life and fill it with prosperity.

Let your wise owl open my spiritual eyes.

Let your olive tree open my spiritual ears.

Let your powerful shield enable my spirit to receive the riches of your wisdom.

Female and male, the arts of war are thine,

Fanatic, much-formed dragoness, divine:

Over the Phlegrean giants, roused to ire,

Thy coursers driving, with destruction dire.

Sprung from the head of Zeus, of splendid mien,

Purger of evils, all-victorious queen.

Hear me, O Goddess, when to thee I pray,

With supplicating voice both night and day,

And in my latest hour, give peace and health,

Propitious times, and necessary wealth,

And, ever present, be thy votaries aid,

O, much implored, art’s parent, blue-eyed maid.
