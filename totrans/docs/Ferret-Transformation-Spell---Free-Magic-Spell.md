Magick is a natural force, you can't become a ferret or an animal at all. This spell is fake and won't work.

You cannot physically transform into a ferret.

This spell is a lot of nonsense. You cannot physically change yourself with magic into something other than human.

why is this in the mermaid category?

Draco was once turned into a ferret by mad moody, but mad eye was told off by McGonagall

Roleplaying is against site rules. SpellsOfMagic is a site about real Pagans/Witches/Wiccans to discuss their faith. [while some cast spells as a hobby, a lot use magick in their religious practices, so making comments like ''in Harry Potter, this happened'' can be insulting to other's religious beliefs] You can enjoy Harry Potter, but HP is a work of fiction. Magick in reality that this site is about isn't the same as fiction. In reality, magick doesn't physically transform humans into animals.

i wasnt roleplaying, i was stating fact

Those aren't ''facts'' since you were referencing a work of fiction. This would be considered roleplaying because this is a site to educate others and you quoted a work of fiction to argue why this spell could work. There was no reason to bring up Harry Potter since the above posts are three ''this doesn't work'' and one about the spell category. I'm simply warning you that using fiction as a way to validate your argument is considered roleplaying on the site and you could get in trouble if you continue.
