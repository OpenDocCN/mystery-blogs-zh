Will we keep our memory

Memory won't be an issue, you aren't going to transform into a cat, no matter how much you may wish it. At best, this may give you the feeling of being more feline, through placebo, but physical transformation isn't going to happen and so memory loss isn't something you will experience. It's not what you want to hear, but physical transformations aren't possible on this plane, look to the astral for more successful results.

You cannot become a cat with Real Magic. Research animal spirits.
