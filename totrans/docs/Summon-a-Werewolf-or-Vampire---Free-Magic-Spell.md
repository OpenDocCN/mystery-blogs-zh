This will not summon anything for a number of reasons, but the biggest one is you insist people have cleansing herbs to summon dangerous astral beings. The sage and lavender would cleanse the room and keep them out, not to mention the salt would too. While I still say this spell is a dud, burn the sage and lavender after to get rid of the negative beings.
