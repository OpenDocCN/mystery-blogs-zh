 Lodestone can be hard to find, so you may have to check out the crystal displays at your local New Age or occult shops. An actual pendant would be nice, but it's not necessary.

Hold the stone in your hands, and rub a little rose and vanilla oil into it. Picture the stone drawing energy in to you, and bringing that special someone into your life. Tie the stone on to the thread to make a necklace of sorts. You can carry it in your pocket if you prefer, but having it around your neck makes a stronger spell.

Get out and spend some time in social groups, to give the stone a chance to draw that person to you.
