 Place the candle on the saucer and set it down. Sit down before the candle and light it. Tear the paper in half (hamburger style) and write the person's name down in the middle. Hold the paper with the name on it over the flame. As it burns, say this chant:

"20, 30, 40 pounds off,
Help this person lose weight,
Let it be as fast as a cough,
And for his or her health to be great.
This is my will, so mote it be."

The chant sounds rather silly, but try it and see. Just remember you need to put forth the effort of actually losing weight, otherwise, nothing will change. Weight loss spells make it easier, it doesn't make it instant.

Wishing the help a friend is noble, but do they want/need your help? Furthermore, a chant alone will not help with weight loss, nor will it be ''as fast as a cough.'' Rapid weight loss is just as dangerous.
