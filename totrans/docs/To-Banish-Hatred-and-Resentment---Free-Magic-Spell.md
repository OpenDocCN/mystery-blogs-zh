 Take your piece of paper and write about the situation and/or person that you wish to banish all hatred and resentment for.

Take your paper, scrunch it up and ignite it with the candle flame, chanting:

Let resentment fall apart.
Give me strength to let this go;
Forget the hatred that I hold.
Bring thy warmth and love to me,
With harm to none, So Mote It Be."

After the paper is all ash, you should begin to feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.

Didnt work.

This might help in small situations, but if you're dealing with an emotional situation or holding a lot of resentment, counseling would probably work better than a spell.

This can work, but a few points. It is not necessary to call in any entities if you do not work with them. Some witches work with deities, some do not. Same with spirits, fairys, dragons, demons, angels, and anything else. If you work with them, call on them, if you do not, a spell can still work without them. As for the spell, it can work, but with most banishings and cord cuttings, you might need to do it more than once. You cannot rush the process, and you need to sit in the pain you are releasing. Once you are finished, you should feel a weight lifted off you. This does not mean you will never think of this person again, but it does mean the pain you feel will have subsided. Depending on the bond, it might require a few banishings, but you should feel a sense of relief when this is done correctly.
