 ## Casting Instructions for 'Persephone's Spell of Protection'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** On January 6th, a group of Persephone's followers carried her statue around her temple and invoked her protection in the coming year. Here's the spell they used.

Open the pomegranate so you may access the seeds. Walk the perimeter of your property dropping a seed at evenly spaced intervals. As you drop these seeds say these words:

This home is protected, safe, and secure. This land is protected, safe, and secure. All those who dwell here are protected, safe , and secure.

Once you've dropped all the seeds dig a small hole near your front door and plant the skin and meat of the pomegranate.

Unless you work with Persephone, I would not call on her. As for this spell, pomegranates do have protective qualities, but it is rare to use them in protection. They are more common for fertility. Overall, seems plausible, but I would not use pomegranates.

I work with both Persephone and Hades. Along with Athena and Zeus.

This is only a few I work with as I work with Egyptian Gods and Gpdeeses as well
