# Protect a book from unwanted/prying eyes and bind it to your soul

Helps if your BoS or diary is in danger of being read by non-Wiccans or your annoying siblings and/or enemies, teachers and classmates. It will make your diary or BoS look like a normal book, especially if you want your secrets etc kept secret. I don't work with deities. You can find most of the ingredients on the online shop. I recommend casting a circle and having a safe to keep your book in as well. It'll be bound to your soul after saying the chant, if done correctly.
