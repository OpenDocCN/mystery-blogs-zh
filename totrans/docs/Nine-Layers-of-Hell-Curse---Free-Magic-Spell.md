# Nine Layers of Hell Curse

This ritual is made to curse and torture a person by the agonies brought on by nine arch-demons. This ritual will allow one to journey into Hell and throw a mortal soul before nine arch-demons and destroy the victim nine times in Hell. This ritual is most likely fatal to the mortal body of the victim. This ritual can invite demons into your home if it is used too much. This spell has one catch, it kills the weakest people in the house of your target first, so repeated use is necessary. This ritual circumvents the judgment of God upon a targeted soul should the victim die as a result.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 round wooden altar

*   9 red candles

*   1 large white candle

*   1 athame

*   1 cursed object (Ouija Board used to channel Zozo works fine)

## Casting Instructions for 'Nine Layers of Hell Curse'

Instructions
(1) Place the red candles in a circle with the white candle in the center on the altar. Place the athame to the right and a cursed object to the left on the altar. Visualize the Gates of Hell opening and the evil energies surrounding your ritual site.
(2) Hold the white candle and visualize that you are holding the person you are going to curse in your hand. Take a few minutes to visualize the person being the white candle and once you feel it, you place the candle back in the center of the circle of red candles and light it.
(3) You can move around the altar as you progress through the ritual. Pick up and hold one of the red candles and visualize that it is a demonic being of fire and smoke and will smite the victim over and over in the most terrible ways as described in each line, while descending into Hell. When you are done, light the candle and go to the next.
(4) Visualize that the victims soul is no more and that it has been erased by Satans appetite. Now you visualize yourself leaving Hell. When you are done, take the athame; blow out the white candle and stab it through.
(5) After you read this line, you blow out the demon candles.
