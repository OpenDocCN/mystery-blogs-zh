**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Pen

*   Paper

*   Object (Preferably something that has a little of meaning to you.)

*   Voice (If you lost it, drink some tea and feel better, sweetheart.

First, take your piece of paper and pen, and draw the word ''Writer's Block'' in the middle of it. (Doesn't need to be accurate, just in/around the middle.)

Take your object and place it on ''Writer's Block''.

Then after that, chant/whisper this saying twice.
''Gods and goddesses, may you help me.
Take away this writer's block, for me.
I will sacrifice my object for you.
If you help me with my lost thinking clue.''

The object will not disappear, but it's energy power will decrease after you do it. After three times, you will no longer be able to use it for the spell, and you must find another object.

It may automatically take it away, or may be a few minutes. It will be gone by 10 minutes.
