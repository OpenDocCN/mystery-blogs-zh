Cleansing

Creature of fire and creature of air, take this circle into your care. Creature of water and

creature of earth, hold us, protect us, grant us rebirth.

Cast the Circle

The Circle is cast. We

stand between the worlds.

EAST: Guardians of the eastern watchtower, spirits of air, creatures of thought and

communication, we bid you join us and protect this circle from all peril approaching from the east.

SOUTH:

Guardians of the southern watchtower, spirits of fire, creatures of faith and will, we bid you join us and protect this circle from all peril

approaching from the south.

and emotion, we bid you join us and protect this circle from all peril approaching from the west.

of the northern watchtower, spirits of earth, creatures of strength and endurance, we bid you join us and protect this circle from all

peril approaching from the north.

of humanity, creatures of identity, we bid you join us and protect this circle from all peril from within.

Invoke the

Goddess: Great Mother, by your thousand names we call upon you. Persephone, Queen and Mother of the Dead, we ask that you

witness this rite.

Invoke the God: Horned One, by your thousand names we call upon you. Hades, King and Father

of the Dead, we ask that you witness this rite.

Drawing Down the Goddess: We call upon the goddess of perfect

Love, who purifies the seas in which worlds are born, and brings to flood and ebb the rivers flowing beneath all manifest being. Behold

now in her Image, crowned with the deepest glory of the sunset, robed in blue and green and silver. We call upon the Goddess who

sets the stars in motion upon the endless mirror of night. Behold her now, Lady of the silver Wheel, crowned with silver and crystal,

robed in deepest black. As Guardian of the Deepest Mysteries of Death and Birth she opens now the Way, and fills the Circle with her

blessing, her power, and the unseen presence. Listen...listen for her heartbeat. Feel her warm and gentle breath as she enters the

circle. Be still, and listen.

PAUSE

The Goddess speaks: I am the Dark Mother. I am the Blood

Mother. I am the Queen of all Creation, and I am the Guardian of the Graveyard. I have given birth to planets, to stars, to entire

galaxies. All that is may call me Mother. Yet I have also birthed the empty husks of dead worlds, and seen the lightless voids in the

universe where my children did not thrive. I have known the pain of losing a child unborn, or unconcieved, or of watching the dead

body of my child emerge from between my thighs. My heart has stopped suddenly when I realized that my newborn child's cries had

stopped. I, who am the Mother of all - I who am the Great Goddess - have cried bitter tears over the loss of my children. And to you

who have shared in such loss, I say this: YOU DID NOT KILL YOUR CHILD!

Your seed is not poisonous... Your

womb is not a house of death.

Your child's life ended before it was truly begun. But you did not kill your child.

There is no blame. You gave all you could to your child, and now the child is gone. You did nothing wrong. The child did nothing wrong.

There is no blame.

Every parent, even before the birth of the child, has dreams for the child, hopes of how the

child will be treated and how the child will treat others. And each parent has a storehouse of love for each child.

In

time you may find that your hopes and dreams, dulled by pain and disappointment, will fade. But do not let that love

fade.

Do not do as others may tell you, and give this love to your other children. Do not do as others may tell you

and dedicate this love to the creative works of your hands and of your mind. This love is a gift your child has given to you; use it

wisely. Do not waste it where it is not needed. Save and cherish this love as love for yourself. Love your body, your mind, your soul.

Learn to accept yourself. For the sake of your child, love yourself.

Look to the stars at night and know that they

are your brothers and sisters. They know your grief, and will help you bear your anger and fear. Look to the Sun and see the bright

face of the Lord of Light; He will always be there to warm you against the shivering cold of loss. Look to the Moon and see Me; I will

always be there to share your sorrow and to hold you when the pain is too much.

But look, too, within yourself,

to find the God and Goddess within you, and to find the love that makes you whole. Feel the fullness of all the love you have within

you. And know that your child loves you still.

PAUSE

Light Candle

Hold

flowers in your hands: These flowers are a representation of my love for you, my child. I give them freely unto the earth, the sun and

the moon in appreciation for this love. I will hold it near to me always.

Bury the flowers in the

pot.

Hold the stone in your hand: This stone is a representation of my unborn child. There is no life in this stone,

yet as I surround this child with the warmth of the earth, life is reborn. My child will live on.

Bury the stone in the

pot.

Chant (begun slowly): In balance with the moon and the sun and the earth

To my soul and

body I will give rebirth.

Take time now to reflect on your feelings. Let all the pain go and fill your heart with love

and happiness for the rebirth of your child.

Great Goddess and Horned God, I give my child back to you. I will no

longer hold the pain of her loss in my heart as you have taken that from me as well. I hold now joy for her rebirth into your

arms.

EAST: Spirits of the east, we thank you for your presence here tonight and for the qualities of thought and

communication with which you have endowed this circle. Go in peace.

SOUTH: Spirits of the south, we thank you

for your presence here tonight and for the qualities of faith and will with which you have endowed this circle. Go in

peace.

WEST: Spirits of the west, we thank you for your presence here tonight and for the qualities of love and

compassion with which you have endowed this circle. Go in peace.

NORTH: Spirits of the north, we thank you for

your presence here tonight and for the qualities of patience and strength with which you have endowed this circle. Go in

peace.

CENTER: Spirits of the center, bright spark of the self, we thank you for giving us the wisdom, the will, the

love, and the patience to partake of the energy of this circle.

Great Mother, we thank you for your love and

understanding. Be with us always.

Horned One, we thank you for your strength and compassion. Be with us

always.

Take down the circle.

The circle is open, yet unbroken. Go with love in your

hearts.

Keep the candle as a reminder of this ritual and burn it whenever pain seeps back into your heart for the

loss you have suffered. Place the pot of earth, stone and flowers where the light of the moon and sun may shine upon it, or bury it in

the earth near to your home.
