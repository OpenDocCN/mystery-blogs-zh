 Find a nice place where you not be disturbed and where you comfortable, do not worry becuase everyone has a dragon guardian from before they were born and they wait day and night for you. Once your comfortable light a few candles hold either a pentagram or a crystal of the three colors (white, black, or green) and be very quiet for a moment...ask out loud for your your dragon guardian to draw near....you don't need to yell, just ask in a normal voice.

Say the following:
"Come draconis, I summon you ( stamp 3 times)
By your might and strength I summon you! (stamp 3 times)
By your wisdom, and ancient love, I summon you! (stamp 3 times)
By your magic, deep and old, I summon you! (stamp 3 times)
Come, Draconis, To My Call!"

When the dragon is near you, you'll feel heat, your shoulders will tingle,you may feel their strong presence, and you even "see" him or her approuching you, do not be afraid for dragon are not harmful beings unless you try to hurt or fight them. But even if you try they are 4th dimensional beings so you can't touch them. You may see colors flash.

Once you've connected with your Mon-tey, laugh with them, talk with them play music for them, and when you play music for them you might hear them dance sometimes. Every dragon has a different taste in music but I'm sure he or she will love your music. And when you drift off to sleep, right before to start dreaming you can hear them speak, dragons are known to have a deep voice. once you are connected with your Mon-tey, everything about you changes and your life will never be the same.

this could work for some, but a couple points, not everyone has a Dragon of their own, they weren't assigned at birth, and the area will feel different depending on the Dragon. not everyone will work with a fire Dragon, so depending on the element the area would feel different [cooler for earth Dragons, damp for water Dragons, windy for air Dragons, heaviness for chaos Dragons, so on] if you don't get a response right away, i would go home and meditate daily, calling to your guardian Dragon, try astral projection, or look up a guided meditation to connect with the Dragons.

Thanks, that little speech helped out a lot! I think this is a great spell if you actually have belief and you understand the right meaning of magick!

This contains a lot of fiction, so I doubt it works at all.
