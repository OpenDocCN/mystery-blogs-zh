## Is Today Your Birthday?

The message of your birthday chart is that you need to get serious about your resources, both financial and emotional. You may want to help everyone you possibly can but that will spread you far too thin. Focus on those who need you the most.

### Aquarius

Think twice before taking up an offer of financial assistance today. There will, of course, be strings attached and the planets warn they may be the kind of strings that tie you down to restrictive commitments. Find other ways to make ends meet.

### Pisces

You may be full of enthusiasm for the week ahead but you are strongly advised to be sensible and limit your plans to a short list of things you know can be accomplished. The planets warn that the more you take on the less you will actually do.

### Aries

Try not to dwell on your mistakes this week. Everyone makes errors – they are a part of life – but it’s what you learn from those errors that counts in the long-term. Despite recent setbacks you are still doing okay – in fact you are doing amazingly well.

### Taurus

You are open to new ideas at the moment but later in the week you may go right the other way and refuse to see any point of view but your own. Try to remember that what matters to you may not matter one little bit to other people.

### Gemini

Some of your aims and ambitions will need to be adjusted over the next few days and the sooner you make whatever changes are needed the less disruption you will have to endure. Gemini is known as a flexible sign, so bend with the breeze.

### Cancer

The Sun in Pisces endows you with huge self-assurance but other aspects warn you must be careful not to go too far and start believing that it is impossible for you to make a mistake – unless you want “events” to bring you down to earth again.

### Leo

Something you thought you had under control will start getting away from you today and, like it or not, you will have to get help from people who have more experience. It’s not a humiliation, it’s just a recognition that you are human like everyone else.

### Virgo

No matter how much you think you know a friend or family member what they say or do today is sure to surprise you. One-to-one relationships need to be handled tactfully at this time of year, so resist the urge to criticize their choices.

### Libra

The demands of colleagues and employers may be getting a bit much for you. If that’s the case then you need to be brave and let them know that enough is enough. You’re not some kind of machine they can just switch on and off at will.

### Scorpio

Focus on creative activities over the next few days. Decide what it is you most want to build then put your heart and soul into it. And don’t listen to those who say you expect too much of yourself – the truth is you can never expect too much.

### Sagittarius

You may not be the life and soul of the party at the moment but that’s okay. Sagittarius is a sign that likes to think deeply about life and with so much on your mind now there is little time for partying. You’ll make up for it later!

### Capricorn

Don’t get visibly angry if someone you live, work or do business with refuses to see sense today. Yes, the evidence clearly points to a certain conclusion but if they don’t want to see it you have no right to force them. Let them learn the hard way.
