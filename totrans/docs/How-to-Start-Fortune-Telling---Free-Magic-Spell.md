First you need to have full control of your body when concentrating.

It is up to you. But here, I will teach you about the mayor arcana
The most powerful cards of the Tarot are the Major Arcana, also known as the Trumps. These cards signify powerful spirituality and life changes and the more that appear in a Tarot reading, the more likely that there are forces at work beyond your control, you will be a better fortune teller.

If you are not pure enough, you will have lots of problems in all fortune telling.
If you are pure, you will have a little problem here and there.
But if you are completely pure, you will have no problem and do your readings perfectly.

I hope this was of use. Happy fortune telling!
