# üïî Weekly Witchy CHALLENGE ~ Catch-Up! - Activities - The Spells8 Forum

My last challenge, while on the internet, is a catch up! This is fun! The cool part about it is I was given a job to do, yesterday, which fits 3 (if not more) challenges on the list. So let‚Äôs dig in.

Challenge Entry: Energy Work

The original request was to define energy. I‚Äôd like to split that a bit. Some may consider it splitting hairs or say I don‚Äôt have to work with these energies, but this is what I was shown during meditation, yesterday, so I choose to act on it for the betterment of all.

What I saw was black. Can‚Äôt define it any other way. No shadow has ever been blacker. It was almost a solid, opaque, horrifying‚Ä¶ but I could see it was not mine. I had invited it into my life by cleaning up the energies in my neighborhood- I guess I had become good at cleansing?

Define it? I call it orphan energy. Someone had a problem they were unable to solve or had to leave before the issue was taken care of. The energy didn‚Äôt travel with them for one reason or another. That energy is assumed to fade or be grounded or sent to the Universe to be transmuted into something neutral and thus useable. If water takes time to be filtered into something drinkable, wouldn‚Äôt energy take time, also? With so many people on this planet who don‚Äôt know how to work with energy responsibly, it makes sense that some areas would have more energy to be cleansed than others; and the more people use, the more it builds up.

This leads to the Challenge Entry: The Challenger.

If I have been made aware of it, the energy build up in my area must be intense; and if I have learned how to transmute such energies, I feel the need to do what I can to help- so someone else doesn‚Äôt have to deal with it. It is not a pleasant job, since I seem to be attracting more than my share of mess, but someone has to do it. Might as well be me.

My tools are meditations by the Ankh Priest family of sites: Ankh Power, Ankh Voice, and Matrix of Life.

Yes, they are Cyrillic, and I don‚Äôt understand all that is written or said. My browsers don‚Äôt always translate everything, and I find myself unable to get every detail. In days gone by, I may have been accused of communism for it- so sue me. It‚Äôs not always all about politics: beauty is beauty, no matter what language it‚Äôs in.

The videos are kaleidoscopic, beautiful to watch, and easy to meditate to. When I focus on the outcome I desire, I find the connections I need, and the magick flows. The videos are a tool, not the source of the magick. I haven‚Äôt figured out as yet if I am using my own energy or the Universal Source, but as long as the work gets done, the finer details will come later.

Last night, I accepted the challenge posted by the Universe, the planet, or my neighborhood. The energy comes to me: I don‚Äôt search for it. I began again nightly watching of these videos with focused intention. Meanwhile, I chant over and over that I want the negative energy to be transmuted into something neutral and useable.

I fell asleep to this magick‚Ä¶ leading to Challenge Entry: Dream Magic.

I was separate from all characters: unseen watcher. The setting was a beautiful Victorian mansion (think the house from the movie Psycho). It kept getting darker and darker with the energy gathered within. I could tell the building itself was not at fault. It was simply acting out in an attempt to get help for those living within it. However, once the energy got lodged within, it wasn‚Äôt going anywhere any time soon.

Buildings and places have their own understanding of energy. Compassion shown to the building or place itself is a binder to your energy which can help in the clearing process. Energy collected was not intended to be used by the building or place in a negative manner. Often what we sense as a haunting may be the building or place crying out for help in mitigating the negative energy into something more neutral and useable.

The cat knew what was going on. We often tell our pets what we feel and think. They cannot tell anyone, so our secrets are safe. Yet if the animal understands, there is the possibility that the animal could carry a heavy load of our emotions- added to their own life issues. I felt the need to tell the cat it wasn‚Äôt their fault.

Our pets can be taught energy work. Whether or not they understand is up to them. The best way to teach them is to do the energy work in their presence and explain what is happening and why. When they get it, they can imitate what they see and feel‚Ä¶ and help in the process next time.

There was a butler. He would cut fruit and notice the fresh fruit was going bad more quickly than usual, but he had no idea why or what was going on. There was no understanding in order to assist the lady of the house, though he could sense something untoward was going on. When he left, he left it all behind because there was no energetic attachment other than the stress of the job.

The owner of the house was a young witch. People were blaming her for the negative energy; but she, also, was a witness to the source of the negativity. By not telling the authorities, she was harboring a criminal; but she didn‚Äôt have proof and didn‚Äôt know whom to tell to get help for the true victims. Meanwhile, the negativity was deepening into a curse, acting out on the witness rather than the original cause of the negativity. The witness was the weak link because of feelings of guilt: knowing it was wrong, but not knowing what to do to help.

Finally, the stress got so bad that the youngling left. Since the issue was not resolved, the energy has remained to become an orphan, haunting the house.

1.  I gave the house compassion. It was not the house‚Äôs fault. This alone can grant a modicum of confidence to continue the work of cleansing.

2.  It wasn‚Äôt the fault of the previous owner. I couldn‚Äôt send the energy to her. It needs cleansing, but not to send it away for some innocent to deal with.

3.  The original source of the negativity happened so long ago than the individual may have learned their lesson and moved on. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to revisit it upon them. I hope that the person has become a better version of themselves- which is a blessing sent to them on their path.

So we are left with the negative energy trapped in an innocent place. I could send it to the Universe, but even the vast expanses can become overwhelmed in time. Energy is neither created nor destroyed, only changed.

The best way to deal with it is to transmute it into something else. I consider the orphaned energy like a know it all teenager: full of something not fully understood, and in desperate need of guidance and active use. Put it to use in the community in some positive way or redefine the energy as something neutral, waiting to be used. If the energy has collected awareness, it can actively seek its own output, but that is rare.

A developer could pull energy from the site and use it to build something good for the community or someone could plant a garden nearby, focusing on pulling the energy from the house as a form of talisman‚Ä¶ if the people know how to do energy work. Otherwise, the energy needs to be grounded and scattered for use elsewhere. I am the aware energy worker, so I can do a grounding and pull the energy with me, giving it a new home deep within the earth, intending it to be neutral for someone else to focus and use at some other place and time.
