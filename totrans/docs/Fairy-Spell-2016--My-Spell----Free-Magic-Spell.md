Not a real spell.

Says who??? I think it is üòÅ

@Mermaid147 This isn't a real spell because you cannot physically transform into a faerie. You can try it if you like but it won't work.

You cannot become a fairy.

A small flaw¬ó You could possibly become a fairy, IF your fairy friend will help you, but you may not be allowed to change back.... I do not mean to be rude I am just speaking the truth! üôÇ

Even then, it will not happen. Fairys are spiritual beings, we are physical beings. Even with a fairys assistance you cannot become one physically because it would contradict natural law which is something Magic does not do on the physical. Perhaps you could make your astral form into a fairy, but you would not be a true fairy, you would be pretending to be one.
