## Casting Instructions for 'Full Moon Spell for Secrets'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** This Beltane Full Moon (at 17 degrees of Scorpio) comes near a difficult aspect-Jupiter opposite Pluto the day before-so this may be an intense, troublesome, and unsettled time. Scorpio is the sign of shared resources. It also rules sex, death, and taxes as well as insurance, secrets, and mysteries. Burn a black or dark red candle and meditate on the secrets you hold. Write down your secrets and imagine what might happen if they were revealed to the world. What are you hiding that is merely serving your ego? What are you hiding which protects yourself or others? What are you hiding because it gives you power? Tear the paper into small pieces and bury them in the earth if you want to keep those secrets, or flush them down the toilet if you want to eliminate them from your life.
