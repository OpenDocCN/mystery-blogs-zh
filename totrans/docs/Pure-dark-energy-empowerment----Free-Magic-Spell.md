 Step one: Cleanse the area you're going to use, and use a protection spell on yourself.

Step two: Create a pentagram on the ground, and put the elemental objects on the right points.

Step three: Meditate in the middle of the pentagram, and take at least ten to fifteen minutes to think about the things that you are going to do with the dark energy.

Step four: speak the following incantation three times, with a clear voice: Tenebris navitas in potentiam tuam, et potest etiam sine fine inanis mortis praebueris corpus meum, et in tribus diebus tunc magica ut reverterentur. (Note: the c is pronounced as k)

Final step: remove the pentagram and throw the non usable resources in a lake or other nearby water source.

I would try explaining and expanding on the symbolic nature of how these elements used in the spell empower the caster. Also expand on what the incantations represents at least. If you do not understand the words you speak, your intentions will not come out as clear.

I agree to this...Also, I recommend members of this website not to blindly trust just any spell they find and get their hands on, not all people can always be trusted. My grandmother for example, told me a story of how she tried what was was supposed to be a good luck spell....Her father and mother died, not much more than 3 days later, and of unknown cause.
