1\. This might help calm you. 2\. You cannot increase your memory with a chant alone. 3\. There is no ''God of Mind.'' Pick a deity that rules over intelligence. Regardless, simply saying ''I want people to think of me a certain way'' will not do much. Visualize what you want, live in accordance with that image, but remember some people will not like you for no reason. Nobody is universally liked.

God of Athena? There's no God of Athena. Athena is a god (or goddess, I suppose). No one holds rule over her in particular (Zeus perhaps? Though he rules over all greek gods)
