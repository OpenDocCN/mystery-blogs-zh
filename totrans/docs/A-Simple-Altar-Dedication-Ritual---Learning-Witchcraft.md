If you have just barely set up an altar, this is a nice, simple and beautiful dedication ritual that you can use to cleanse the altar space and work on dedicating it to all of your magical workings.

You Need:

Incense
Two Altar Candles
White Candle
Ritual Tools (optional)

Before you start, simply clean the altar space thoroughly, burning incense to help cleanse the area. If you happen to have a besom, you can use it to sweep any negative energies away. Place your two altar candles opposite one another on the altar. One should be on the right, one should be on the left.

The Dedication

To start dedicating the altar, you will light the altar candle on the left side, then the right. Now, you light the white candle, taking it in your hand. Walk in a clockwise motion over the perimeter of the sacred altar area with the candle in your hand, chanting:

By the Light, in which cuts through darkness
By the Fire, in which burns within
By my Will, in which stirs the elements
Let nothing that is harmful in.

After you complete the altar circle, you can then set the candle down in front of you on the altar, saying:

So mote it be.

Any of the work you need to have completed while you are in this circle of sacred space. This will include consecrating and blessing any tools, putting them in the right spot, performing your dedication to any of the deities that you want to celebrate at your altar.

Once you are done, take your candle in your hand once again, walking anti-clockwise around the sacred space, repeating:

By my Will, in which called the elements
By the Fire, in which burned so bright
By the Light, in which it lit the darkness
I will be leaving you for tonight.

Set your white candle at the altar, extinguishing it this time. The, you can extinguish the other two candles, saying:

So mote it be.
