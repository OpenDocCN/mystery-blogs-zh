# Summoning Voice of the Shadows

  Rated 1/5 Stars

This spell isn't for the weak, this is for people who want answers on those what they visualize, hear, and feel. I don't recommend not having a protection circle, or charm.

Quick summary - I have seen, hear, touched, and talked to shadows for years, some are friendly some aren't I have woken up with cuts on me and been held down before. So be careful and be wise.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Summoning Voice of the Shadows'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   two candles (scented doesn't matter what kind, I prefer vanilla or an herbal scent)

*   Silence

*   Dark

*   Full moon

*   Patience

*   Complete concentration

*   Third Eye

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   two candles (scented doesn't matter what kind, I prefer vanilla or an herbal scent)

*   Silence

*   Dark

*   Full moon

*   Patience

*   Complete concentration

*   Third Eye

Light your candles, you can do this anywhere, in your room, bathroom, living room, where ever seems more comfy.

Make sure it is a full moon and dark (on here will tell you moon phases, if you really want to know when the next full moon is just google it.)

Meditate for a few minutes, breathe in slowly, take deep breaths, let the aroma of the candles fill your lungs, and cleanse your mind from anything that happened that day. Make sure you are very still, open your third eye, visualize where you are, memorize the room, then open your eyes.

Chant this slowly

''I know you are here, I seen you follow me, I know you want to contact me, but I need answers, if you are here now, show me a sign, whisper into my ear, let me know that you are near''

After chanting you should hear a low hushed voice, or something moving across your room, do not be afraid, be sure to keep your eye on it if you do see something moving.

If you are new to SoM, I suggest practicing small, easy spells, this spell can either give you a head ache or scare you.

I am not responsible for the following nightmares, headaches, feeling like your chest is heavy, and feeling cold...

If you have any questions please mail me. If the spell works, and you can't get rid of the shadow, I will tell you how.

If you wish for a shadow to protect you while you sleep, simply say ''I welcome you, protect me through this night, allow me to rest and awake refreshed, don't let them through the gate, I trust you, you must trust me.'' There is a 10% chance that this will work.

All this worked for me, especially if I loose contact with one of them or if it lost it's way..

Have fun!!
