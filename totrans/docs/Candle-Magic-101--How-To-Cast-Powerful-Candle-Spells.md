> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/candle-magic/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/candle-magic/#0001-01-01)

Candle magic is one of the oldest types of magic to exist, dating back to ancient civilizations where flames were revered signs of divine presence. Today, the art of candle witchcraft continues to thrive, allowing witches to cast simple and powerful spells that manifest *fast*.

Today, I’m covering the basics of candle spells from A-Z. Let’s jump in!

## What IS Candle Magic?

Okay, let’s start with the basics. Candle magic is a form of spellwork or ritual that harnesses the power of candles to focus your intention and manifest your goals. It’s like using candles as a tool to amplify your thoughts and desires out into the universe. Pretty cool, right? The idea is that as you light your candle and focus on your intention, the flame acts as a beacon, sending your energy and wishes out into the cosmos.

## The History of Candle Magic…

Candle magic has roots that stretch back through the annals of time, with traces of its practice found in ancient civilizations around the world. In ancient Egypt, candles were used in rituals honoring the gods and goddesses, with the flickering flame symbolizing the presence of divine energy. Similarly, in ancient Rome, candles were often lit as offerings to the gods, believed to carry prayers and petitions to the heavens.

The practice of using candles for magical purposes also has deep roots in medieval Europe, where it became intertwined with various occult traditions and mystical practices. During the Middle Ages, candles were often inscribed with symbols, words, or sigils to enhance their magical potency, and they were used in rituals for everything from healing to protection to divination.

Ultimately, candles don’t belong to any one religion – fire is an essential element in our world. Candle magic will most likely continue to be used by [all types of witches](https://teaandrosemary.com/types-of-witches-types-of-witchcraft/) for just about every kind of spell you can think of.

## Why Choose Candle Witchcraft Over Other Spells?

**Primarily, you’ll choose candle magic when you need a spell to happen *fast*.** Think about fire – it lights quickly and blows out just as swiftly. Candle magic is similar. **[Jar spells](https://teaandrosemary.com/jar-spells-rituals/)** take a while to manifest, but tend to hold, while candle spells manifest quickly but may not last as long.

Choose a candle spell when you need something to happen in the next month or so, and when you’re not looking for super long-term results. If you need something to happen quickly but *also* last, you can combine a candle spell with a jar spell.

## How To Perform Candle Magic:

So how do you actually cast a spell from A-Z using candle magic? Here are the basic steps of any candle magic spell.

### 1\. Choose Your Candle

First things first – you’ll need to pick out the perfect candle for your magical workings. While any candle can technically be used for candle magic, many practitioners prefer to use specific colors and scents that align with their intentions. Here’s a quick rundown of some common candle colors and their associated meanings:

*   White: Purity, clarity, spiritual enlightenment
*   Red: Passion, love, courage
*   Green: Abundance, prosperity, growth
*   Blue: Healing, tranquility, communication
*   Yellow: Success, creativity, optimism
*   Purple: Intuition, psychic abilities, spiritual power
*   Black: Protection, banishing, absorption of negative energy
*   Grey: Neutrality, balance, neutrality
*   Pink: Love, affection, compassion
*   Orange: Creativity, enthusiasm, vitality

Of course, feel free to get creative and choose a candle that resonates with you and your intentions. Trust your instincts!

### 2\. Set Your Intention

Now that you’ve got your candle, it’s time to set your intention. This is the heart and soul of candle magic – the thing you want to manifest or bring into your life. Take a moment to think about what you truly desire, whether it’s love, abundance, healing, or anything else your heart desires. Be as specific as possible, without limiting the spell. For example, you can be super specific about what you want, but may not want to mention *how *or *when* you get it, to allow the magic to work in unexpected ways.

Once you’ve got your intention clear in your mind, hold the candle in your hands and focus on infusing it with your energy and intention. Visualize your goal as if it’s already happening, and really feel the emotions associated with it. When you’re ready, place the candle in a holder and get ready to light it up!

### 3\. Light Your Candle

With your intention set, it’s time to light your candle. As you strike the match or flick your lighter, take a deep breath and feel the energy shift in the room. As the flame ignites, imagine it as a spark of divine energy, carrying your intention out into the universe. Some people like to say a little prayer or affirmation as they light their candle, while others prefer to simply focus on their intention in silence. Do whatever feels right for you!

### 4\. Focus and Meditation

With your candle burning bright, take some time to focus on your intention. You might want to meditate, pray, or simply sit quietly and visualize your goal coming to fruition. Let the flame be your guide, drawing you deeper into a state of relaxation and receptivity. Pay attention to any thoughts, feelings, or insights that arise during this time – they could be messages from your higher self or the universe guiding you towards your desired outcome.

This is the part where you can write your intention on a piece of paper and burn it in the flame if you desire. But this isn’t at all necessary for a candle magic spell.

### 5\. Close the Ritual

Once you feel like you’ve spent enough time with your candle, it’s time to close out the ritual. You can do this by extinguishing the flame with a snuffer or by blowing it out gently (just be careful not to blow wax everywhere!). Or, you can let the candle burn down until it extinguishes naturally. Trust that your intention has been heard and that the wheels are now in motion to bring your desires into reality.
