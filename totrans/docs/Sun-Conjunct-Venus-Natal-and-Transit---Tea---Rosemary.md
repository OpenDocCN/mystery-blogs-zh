***The Sun conjunct Venus natal and transit placements are truly wonderful, leading to harmonious energy and all things beautiful. Today we’re diving into the specifics!***

The Sun represents the core essence of an individual’s personality, ego, and identity. It symbolizes the conscious self, willpower, and the desire to shine and be recognized. The Sun is associated with creativity, self-expression, and leadership qualities.

Venus, on the other hand, is the planet of love, beauty, relationships, and values. It governs how one expresses affection and seeks harmony and pleasure in life. Venus is associated with social grace, charm, artistic abilities, and a desire for meaningful connections.

**Because Venus is always close to the sun, it’s only possible to have Sun conjunct Venus in the natal chart, so that’s the aspect we’ll be focusing on today.**
