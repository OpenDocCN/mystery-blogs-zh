Say the chant together then kiss again. Place the bark somewhere that you will see it everyday ( and while your having sex, have it near you) As you walk by it during the day, say " thank you (god / goddess)

Chant:
"Mother and Father
we will be
bless a child
unto me
if we're not ready
give us a sign
Tell us (god/goddess)
If we need more time
If it harm none,
let it be done.
Blessed Be."
