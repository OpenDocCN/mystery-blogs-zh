This article will give a basic guide and overview of the Minor Arcana in tarot, also known as the lesser arcana. If you’ve come to the wrong place, here is a guide to the [Major Arcana](https://craftofwicca.com/a-guide-to-the-major-arcana-tarot-meanings/). A deeper dive into each of the cards are given in the links.

 ## What is the Minor Arcana in tarot?

The minor arcana in the tarot is the set of 56 cards that make up the smaller, or lesser, arcana of the tarot deck. They are often divided into four suits, similar to the suits in a deck of playing cards: cups, swords, wands, and pentacles. Each suit has 14 cards, with numbered cards from Ace through 10 and four court cards: the Page, Knight, Queen, and King.

 Some people ask: Is the King of Cups major or minor arcana? As you see, this card is in the minor arcana because it has the suit cups.

 The minor arcana are considered to be more concerned with everyday life and the practical aspects of existence, whereas the major arcana deals with more profound, spiritual, and universal themes. Each card in the minor arcana represents a specific aspect of life, such as love, money, work, and so on. They can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context of the reading and the other cards that appear alongside them.

 The imagery and symbolism on the cards can vary depending on the deck, but most will depict people, objects, and scenes that are related to the suit or number of the card. A reader or interpreter of the tarot would use the pictures on the cards to help understand and interpret the reading.

### What does “arcana” mean in tarot?

“Arcana” is a Latin word that means “secrets” or “mysteries.” In the context of tarot, the word “arcana” is used to refer to the 78 cards of a tarot deck, which are divided into two main categories: the major arcana and the minor arcana.

 The major arcana consists of 22 cards that represent major life events or experiences, such as The Fool, The Lovers, and Death. These cards are often considered to be more powerful or significant than the minor arcana cards. The major arcana cards often depict archetypal characters or symbols, and they are often seen as representing the journey of the soul or the evolution of the self.

 The minor arcana consists of 56 cards that are divided into four suits (Cups, Wands, Swords, and Pentacles), much like a deck of regular playing cards. Each suit has 14 cards, which are numbered from Ace to 10, and four court cards (Page, Knight, Queen, and King). The minor arcana cards often depict scenes from everyday life and are seen as representing the events and experiences that shape a person’s day-to-day existence.

In a reading, the Major Arcana and Minor Arcana cards can be interpreted together or separately. The Major Arcana are seen as the overall narrative of the spread, whereas the Minor Arcana will often contain more detail about the current situation and how it might develop.

 ## The four suits of the Lesser Arcana

In a traditional tarot deck, the minor arcana is made up of four suits: Cups, Wands, Swords, and Pentacles. Each suit represents a different aspect of life or a different area of focus.

## How the Minor Arcana works in a tarot reading

In a real tarot reading, the minor arcana can play a variety of roles depending on the question being asked and the spread is used. Here is an example of how the minor arcana might play a role in a specific reading:

A client comes to a reader asking about a new job opportunity they’re considering. The reader lays out a [3-card spread](https://craftofwicca.com/beginner-tarot-how-to-get-started/) that addresses the client’s current situation, the potential job opportunity, and the potential outcome. In this spread, the reader draws the following cards:

 *   The current situation: The Four of Cups
*   The potential job opportunity: The Ace of Wands
*   The potential outcome: The Nine of Swords

In this reading, the Four of Cups represents the client’s current emotional state, which is one of detachment and apathy towards their current job. The Ace of Wands represents the new job opportunity and its potential for inspiration, creativity, and passion, a new beginning in career matters.

 Finally, The Nine of Swords represents the client’s fear and anxiety about making a change and the potential consequences of taking this new job.

 The reader would then interpret the cards and provide guidance to the client. They might point out that the Four of Cups suggests that the client is feeling unfulfilled in their current job, but that the Ace of Wands represents an exciting new opportunity that could bring a lot of passion and inspiration into the client’s life.

The Nine of Swords would be interpreted as the client’s fear and anxiety about making a change in their career, but the fear and anxiety are mostly within the client’s mind and it is important to address and overcome it.

 In this example, the minor arcana cards were used to provide specific information about the client’s current emotional state and the potential opportunities and challenges associated with the new job opportunity.

The minor arcana can play a crucial role in a reading by providing detailed information about a specific situation or event and can help the reader gain a deeper understanding of the client’s current circumstances and potential future outcomes.
