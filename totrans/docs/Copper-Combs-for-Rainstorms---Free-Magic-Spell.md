# Copper Combs for Rainstorms

This ritual, when done with a coven, will create violent wind and rain storms. Best performed by an all-female coven of over three members. Use with caution, as always! Note: it is not recommended to use this spell to get rain for peaceful means. This spell is better used to drive off an enemy.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Copper Combs for Rainstorms'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Basil leaves (enough for each participant to have one)

*   Almonds (see above)

*   Candied rose petals (see above, technically you could do this with regular rose petals but they taste pretty bad and the effect is the same with candied petals)

*   Red wine (chalice is optional)

*   Copper hair combs (enough for each participant, can be embossed with symbols for the Great Mother and the destructive side of the Rose, or the Maiden.)

*   Hair ties

*   Red wine (chalice is optional)

*   Copper hair combs (enough for each participant, can be embossed with symbols for the Great Mother and the destructive side of the Rose, or the Maiden.)

*   Hair ties

 The first thing you need to do is get your coven together and put them in the right mood. (As in, fill them and yourself with the power of the Great Mother) This is where the food comes in. 

1\. Have each member of your coven eat one basil leaf, one almond, and one candied rose petal. 

2\. They should also each take one sip of the red wine.

3\. Have them plait their hair. 

The next part is where you’ll harness the power you’re now filled with. 

1\. Stand in a circle someplace indoors, unless you want to get drenched. 

2\. Pass out the copper combs and instruct everyone to let down their hair.

3\. Violently comb your hair, throwing the combs to each other and working every last snarl out. 

4\. Toss your hair around.

5\. Heavy wind and rain storms should arrive within the hour. If they don’t, try adding more people or doing an extra ritual to call upon the Great Mother. 

Be careful! My wishes for your success in defeating your enemies!
