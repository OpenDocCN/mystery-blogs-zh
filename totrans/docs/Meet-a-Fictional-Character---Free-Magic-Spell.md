*   5 candles

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Belief

*   A voice

*   A picture of the character - hand drawn or from the internet

*   5 candles

Make sure you are alone and you will not be interrupted.
First you place the picture on the floor and place the five candles around it with enough space for your character to stand in the middle.
You then close your eyes and chant six times:
Fire, water, earth and air
They're not here and I'm not there
They're not real but I don't care
Bring them here so we can share
Fire, water, earth and air

If you did it right, when you open your eyes, your character should appear in front of you in place of the picture. Be careful not to let any of the candles blow out or the character will disappear. It usually lasts for about 5 minutes so make the most of it and have a nice chat with them.

This would be cool, if real

It isn't you cannot physically create a anything from nothing. While this could be a visualization technique or meditation, it will not bring the character to life and have it physically appear before you.

Nekoshema that might be a fact but it still gets people's goes down ▪^▪

I can list plenty of facts that make people sad. Genocides throughout history for example. You shouldn't avoid facts simply because it makes you sad. Yes, depending on the age of the person you might wish to avoid stating certain facts [telling a child Santa isn't real for instance] but as we grow, we should be able to hear difficult truths and accept them. Magick is real. You can use it to bring change into your life, however, it has to be natural change because, on the physical, that's how magick works. You could create a thoughtform designed off your favourite character, you could also look into astral projection and see if you can create a fictional character on the astral. Unfortunately, the physical has more rules and limitations.

If someone who has a certain sickness tries it can it hurt him?

I don't exactly know. If the illness is limiting, probably it would. However if it's like color blindness, probably not.

Would electric candies work im not allowed to light candles in the house and if you will just say it doesn't work, don't. It's rude and gets people's hopes down. Yes, I'm looking at you nekoshema >:[

It isnt rude if theyre telling the truth. This spell doesnt work, and people like Nekoshema are just trying to help people out, by pointing out fact from fiction.

I'm trying to help people learn, sorry it's facts you don't want to hear. Regarding your candle dilemma, you can use electric candles.

You cannot bring a fictional character to life.

Would this work with 4 candles? Can this be used more then once? Will this work (someone who has done it please answer)?

If you would like to make cartoon characters ect then look into things like lucid dreaming

I wish this'll really work. I really want to see and be with Angel Dust(Don't ask why).

Oh, I'm going to ask, especially when Alastor is an option. [jokes aside, try it, but if this works, it would either create a thoughtform, or you'll have a dream of them]

it actually worked for my nephew. it didnt work when i did it but he managed to communicate with castiel from spn

I want to summon stick Stickly from Nick in the afternoon from 1994-98

As others have said, it will not literally let you meet a fictional character as if they are real. They're fictional. However, it could trick your subconscious into creating your own perception of that character as a sort of thought form -- think something Jungian here -- and you can have a conversation. However, you would be speaking with an aspect of yourself, expressed through your concept of the character.

What Do I Do If I Don't Have Candles?

Does This Spell Work Without Candles?
