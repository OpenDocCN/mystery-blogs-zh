Setting aside the claim this is a Romani spell, I take issue with any spell you need to feed another in secret. This is more a personal morals thing than a ''fake spell'' thing. What if they have an allergic reaction? What if you make them sick? Regarding spells that influence others, are okay toying with a persons free will to achieve your goal? This spell is plausible, though I would exchange cinnamon with lavender. Lavender and rosemary work well together in love spells. Cinnamon still has love qualities, so it would still work.
