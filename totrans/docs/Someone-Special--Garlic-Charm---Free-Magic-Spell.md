# Someone Special: Garlic Charm

To inflame a heart with passion (and dominate them too!)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Someone Special: Garlic Charm'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Two garlic cloves

*   Steel nail

*   Red thread (optional)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Two garlic cloves

*   Steel nail

*   Red thread (optional)

Puncture two garlic cloves, one on top of the other, with a steel nail, so that they are held together. (You may also wrap a red thread around them for reinforcement.) The clove on top represents the person making the charm. Make sure that one stays on top.
Hide this charm in a dark, private place at least until the other person begins to demonstrate signs of affection (or you no longer want them.)

Should the bottom garlic sprout, this is a very auspicious sign.
