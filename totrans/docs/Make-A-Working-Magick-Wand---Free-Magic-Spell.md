Imma try this

dose it actually work , can you cast actuall spell's with it?

are you aloud to decorate (carve.e.t) your wand

A wand is simply a tool for focussing and directing energy, it can be a plain twig, or an intricately craved and decorated magickal tool how your wand looks entirely depends on your own practice and taste.

thanks. now at least my mum won't through it away thinking its a useless twig

I did it I'm still wondering if it will work hopefully it will

I have only cast one spell so far, I can feel my energy any time I want and a couple of months ago I have been able to put it in difrint parts of my body. But my only question is why does it come from below my heart, I feel it's intense flames a lot, if any one has an answer please let me know.

you're probably connected to fire if your magic feels like that. Mine feels flowey, so I count myself as a water elemental.

I feel fluttery when I use magick. Often when I'm outside casting a spell, something ranging from a breeze to a strong wind will come by during the spell. Occasionally when I release a spell indoors AC will go off as soon as I release the spell (this most often happens when I make a Psi ball and release it to practice energy flow).

Sounds like u have a strong fire element user

I'm kinda new to all of this, but my friend started dabbling here and there a few months ago. She says that no spell is going to work if I don't ''sign off'' to at least one god/goddess. Is that actually true?

You don't have to involve deity in your craft at all! There are traditions that would require deity or spirits to be involved, but there are also witches who don't honor or even believe in deities. If that doesn't work for you there's nothing wrong with not working with a god/dess.

what do you mean sign off

In this case''sign off'' means become someone who works,worships,or praises a certain thing or person.

I just went out, and it is very rainy. But I asked give trees, they were all cold. Then I went to the great sycamore in our yard, a tree with nearly 6 feet of width, and it's bark was warm despite the icy sleet. I walked to one kg the low hanging branches, and saw one thick stick near a foot long just in my reach. I expected it to be a struggle to pull down, but it fell right into my hands. It most definitely worked.

How do I know if it worked?

U will feel a ticklish sensation of energy, most likely.

What if one has a wooden wand thats been man made would it be useful or should one just use it for decoration and use a wand asked from the tree instead?

Wands can be made from anything. The material would have special properties giving the wand unique energies. It doesn't have to be oak or maple, it could be made of metal, crystals, plastic, or whatever. So long as you feel connected to it, it works.

I have a wand that was from a movie called fantastic beasts and where to find them I love the design and I¬ím fascinated with it would I be able to use that as my wand as I¬ím not good at carving wood and diy stuff doesn¬ít go well with me

If you feel a connection to it, you can. Cleanse it, bless it, and use it as a spiritual tool and it'll work fine.

just pick up a stick and wave it in a wise direction to bless

What do you do after it declines?

Thank it and move on. Taking from something that has declined will taint the energy of the object if you choose to take it anyway.

Help I didn¬ít know if it was warm it felt like lukewarm can I use it?

a staff works better for directing your magic

What to do with the wand? Like which types of spells can I use it in and how??

I think I have an idea of how it happened. Did you jump off anything or do anything dangerous? üßê

@Declan no, it's used for ceremony/rituals and spell casting while you are doing a spell, it do not work like HarryPotter lol

Yes and no. Skipping through the woods going ''Magic weee'' does not do anything. Approach a tree, introduce yourself and ask if you can use a branch. Connect with the trees energy. Meditate by the tree, if you place your hand on the tree, you should feel the energy pulsing. Warm or cold could be the energy, but more likely its dependent on the weather and the sun on the tree. If you get a yes, thank the tree and leave an offering. The branch should be the length of your arm, from your elbow to the tip of your middle finger, because you will shape and design your wand and it will be worked down. When you have your wand, bless and dedicate it (see different spell). Purchasing a wand is also fine, but treat it the same way you connected with the tree. Sense the Magik and choose the one you are drawn to, not the first one or the prettiest one. It is annoying to say, but you will know when you see it.

I did a spell outside without my wand I had used all my energy but radiated it through my body and out my hands and it start raining then lightning struck the tree I was next to and it lit on fire so I used my wand to stop the spell and it started raining harder I got scared and lost control and the lightning started striking the ground in random spot what element and I

What a strange dream. You are every element. You may find yourself with an affinity to one or another, or more than one. But you possess qualities of all of the elements symbolically represented in magical traditions.

Like prsona said, we're all the elements and through our craft, we learn to balance these energies. Since you didn't state if this was a dream or not, I would caution you against roleplaying because it's against site rules. [also, you claimed in the first line to not have a wand, then contradicted yourself in the third line by claiming you had a wand] If this was a dream, I'd say it's a fear of losing control or being unable to control your magick. Fire and lightning are symbols of uncontrollable anger and sudden changes in one's life and a tree is usually a spiritual awakening. So, this could be a situation in which you lost your temper, but it seems more likely you're growing in the craft and you're afraid you'll do harm. I'd meditate and journal about your fears to try and come to terms with them.

throwing the wand to the ground in anger has nothing to do with ''backfire'' that was three fold law, what thee send forth comes back to thee times three, do/cast good you get good back times three, you do/cast bad you get bad back times three, its Karma universal rule

The rule of 3 is a concept associated with the Wiccan religion and does not apply to those that do not follow the religion.

/huh/. unique. maybe i¬íll try this sometime.

It's a pretty chill spell. I can feel a really strong energy in the wand now, and it get the wind blowing pretty good.
