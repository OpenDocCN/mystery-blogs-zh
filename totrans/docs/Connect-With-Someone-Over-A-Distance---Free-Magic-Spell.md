**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 Blue candle

*   1 Silver candle

*   ''Come To Me'' incense

*   ''Spirit'' oil

*   Matches/lighter

 Light the Silver candle and visualize the vibrant color of this candle molding into a "bridge", bridging only the gap of communication between you and the other individual.

Light the Blue candle and visualize the vibrant color of this candle molding and blending into the Silver "bridge" made by the Silver candle's color, strengthening that bridged gap of communication between you and the other individual.

Burn the "Come To Me" incense and as the smoke whirls up and around, visualize the smoke traveling down the Silver and Blue "bridge" of communication to reach the other individual in his or her Throat Chakra (located directly at the neck).

Anoint each candle, starting with the Silver candle, with the "Spirit" oil and speak this chant aloud:

"With these words I speak to thee
Bridge the gap 'tween you and me
Communicatively speaking
Signs and happenstances be our words
Via Poseidon's waves, or Athena's birds
Travel swiftly, do not be late
Now we shall communicate"

Blow the candles out in any order, and let the incense burn itself out.

You should begin to sense the presence of the connection between you and the other individual more and more everyday after casting this spell.

** To communicate, sit down and really attempt to feel him or her there with you; ask him or her questions. If they are trivial questions, such as those that require a simple YES or NO, the answer might come much simpler and quicker. But if large and important, don't expect the answer to come until it is the right time and/or place.
