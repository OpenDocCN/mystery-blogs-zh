I highly doubt this works, but given the 1-5 day window, I would argue it is more probability than Magik. Check the five day forecast before doing the spell, then every day after. The weather might have given a 5% chance on day five, but by day three, that 5% became 25% not because of the spell, but by how weather predictions work.
