i am trying it tonight i might think doin it in the woods might work as well IMA DO IT

So I'm trying out the spell. I don't have the persons full name but I have a photo so hopefully it'll work.

Slenderman is not real, this does not work.

You do realize that with belief you can create a tulpa and since so many people know about Slenderman you can use their fear and knowledge to enhance the tulpas power. Thus the spell can 100% work.

I am aware you can create a tulpa in Slenderman's image however, this spell claims you are summoning THE Slenderman, which is not real, to kill someone, which will not work with this spell. At best, you could pool your energy into a tupla or other symbol to curse the person, but the spell claims you summon Slenderman to potentially kill your enemy. Since that is what the spell claims, it will not work that way.

What paper should I use a blank one or with lines?

It doesn't matter. Something you can write on. I've used both lined and blank in spells and it's never made a difference.

You know if you think about it your enemy might know how to use magik and if they get there hands on this spell who knows what will happen this spell honest!y scares the crap out of me. And I am staying away from this till I'm better at casting because I'm scared for my life that I will miscast and never see the light of day again because I'm not very good I had one successful spell and one that possibly worked but I had to go home before I could fully clarify.
