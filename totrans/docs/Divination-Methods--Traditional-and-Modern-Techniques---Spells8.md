Do you know that birds bring messages from Spirit? In this post we will explore some types of divinations, both traditional and not-so-traditional. From Folk Magic to modern-day Wicca. Let‚Äôs start with some little-known divination methods:

## Traditional Divination Methods üßÖ

**Ornithomancy** is a practice, even mentioned in the Bible, that Romans used to understand the messages of birds, both favorable or unfavorable. It was believed that the omens manifest themselves through the flights and songs of birds.

**Cromniomancy** is a great method to learn more about a situation through the use of onion sprouts. Inscribe the person‚Äôs name on it and leave it on the altar. If the onion grows fast, then this it is a sign of improvement, health and happiness. In the past, young women also used this technique to find out who would become their long-term love partner.

**Capnomancy** predicts events by looking through the smoke. Burn either poppy or jasmine seeds on burning coals¬†and observe. If the flame is thin, it brings a good omen. Otherwise, it is time to think carefully about the situation at hand.

**Omphalomancy** is a divination method to determine how many children a mother could have in her full life spam through a newborn‚Äôs umbilical cord.

**Onychomancy** is a prediction tool where one rubs oil into their nails and is exposed that before sunlight. The symbols that appeared before nails indicate the nature of the coming events. The location of the symbols on the nail allows one to date them. If a symbol arises high up, then it‚Äôs an indicator of an event in the near future.
