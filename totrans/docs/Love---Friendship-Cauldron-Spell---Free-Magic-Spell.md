# Love & Friendship Cauldron Spell

This is a novice love spell. It's not necessarily of the sexual nature, but it has the potential to do this as well. It's mostly about friendship which can develop into several kinds of love.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

Write the name of the friend or crush who you want a bigger relationship with. This is best done during a full moon so that you have the most magical energy. Chant the lines below, I like to do it multiple times:

Fire burns red as does my mind for your friendship,
Together we can brave any hardship.
With each other by our side,
Our hearts will always stay allied.
I enjoy your visits most of all,
Of our first days I will always recall.

After repeating these lines burn the small piece of paper. As the small piece of paper burns, drop it into the cauldron. Let is burn as much as is possible. Afterwards you should pour the water and remains from the cauldron onto the ground within view of the moon.
