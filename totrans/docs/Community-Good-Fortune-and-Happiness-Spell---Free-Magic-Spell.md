Take your birds seeds and pour some in the small pouch. Take the larger pouch (or jar) and fill it with all the happy items you can fit in it, then insert the smaller pouch into the larger one and leave it for a day to soak up all those energies.

After a day, remove the smaller bird pouch from the jar/larger pouch and go out to feed some birds (ideally on a bright, clear day). It's recommended you remind yourself of your intent and project it onto the seeds as you feed the birds. And voila! You're done!

Remember to help out your community after to help strengthen the spell.
