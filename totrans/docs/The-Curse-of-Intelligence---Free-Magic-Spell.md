# The Curse of Intelligence

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This isn't really a spell, but rather a dilemma I have, and this is nothing against people who don't have this, it is just a fact.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'The Curse of Intelligence'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**Hello Everyone.
I have a question for all of you.
Why?
Why do we exist?
Why do we have to suffer through our lives if we know we are going to die?
And do we have a purpose?

These are all questions I have been asking myself now, but whenever I tried to ask people these questions, they either blew me off or thought I was suicidal, but never actually understood what I was saying, and I think I have finally figured out why. They aren't intelligent enough to comprehend these questions. I do not proclaim myself to be the most intelligent person there is, I am just stating a fact. In all honesty, I would rather be in their shoes, living life happy and normal. But I am to intelligent to live that type of life. I know that there are other people like me. That is why it is called the curse of intelligence. I may sound naive, but I think that if we banded together, we would be able to actually figure out those things and finally break this curse of knowing that everything we do is meaningless.

You're asking philosophical questions, that doesn't make you smart. People blow you off because they don't wanna deal with that. I personally hate philosophical questions.
