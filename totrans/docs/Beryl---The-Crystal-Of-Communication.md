Hi and welcome to Wicca Now. As you may already know, Wicca Now is a site where Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/), this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or this article on [aventurine ‘the crystal of venus](https://wiccanow.com/aventurine/)‘. Today I thought we’d focus on a specific crystal, or more specifically a group of crystals, namely beryl.

## Beryl – It’s Meaning and Benefits

Beryl is actually a group of minerals, the most famous of which include emerald and aquamarine. Beryl crystals such as emerald and aquamarine are generally called ‘precious beryls’ whilst more cloudy opaque beryls are called ‘common beryls’.

Beryls were super popular in ancient Egypt and beryl quarries dating back to as early as 1650BCE have been discovered along the Red Sea.

Beryl was also a popular choice for beads and crystal balls during the middle ages as it’s large, often perfect crystals can grow up to three feet long.

Beryl can range in color from blue through to pink, green and yellow. The stones themselves can be almost transparent to opaque and generally have a shiny lustre.

## Spells Featuring Beryl

### An Amulet For Safe Travels

Planning a trip? Why not carry a beryl amulet with you to keep you safe on your travels. This spell requires no ingredients other than a small piece of beryl and a stick of incense and a small pouch. The best time to work this spell is shortly before you are due to leave on your trip as this will ensure that its magick is at its most potent.

**You’ll need:**

*   A piece of beryl crystal
*   A stick of incense
*   A small pouch

**Method:**

*   Step 1 – Take a [cleansed](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-cleanse-your-crystals-6-no-fuss-tips-and-tricks/) piece of beryl into your hands and allow it to warm up. Now place it in front of you and light the stick of incense. Use the incense to write in the air above the crystal any specific needs or goals related to your planned trip. For example, you might like to work with an affirmation such as ‘I am safe and protected at all times’. Say the words as you write them, either out loud or in your mind. This imprints the words into the ether, the energetic dimension in which wishes are transformed into reality.
*   Step 2 – Place the crystal into the pouch and carry it with you when you travel and when touching it, say the affirmation again in your mind. This will release its powers into your life.
*   Step 3 – When you have arrived at your destination safely, thank the crystal for its help and guidance and place it on a window sill or ledge to recharge with moonlight. When you crystals have been cleansed and [charged](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-charge-your-crystals-15-fantastic-tips/), always be sure to store them in a safe quiet space, ready for their next use.
