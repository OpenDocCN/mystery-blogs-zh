Jar spells are one of the easiest things to do, and they’re something every magic practitioner needs to know. They’re often used for protection, but they can be used in any situation that needs “sweetening”. Could someone benefit from being kinder? Could a group benefit from added harmony? These are just a few of the great uses of a honey jar spell, and why you should add one to your spell arsenal.

**To make a honey jar spell, find a jar, pen, paper, honey, and candle. Write the names of the people you’re promoting harmony in. Then rotate the page as you write your intention, encircling the names. Fill the jar with honey and submerge the paper. Burn the candle over the jar, sealing it with wax.**

 This article will serve as your uncomplicated guide into making a honey jar spell. We’ll talk about the uses of a honey jar spell, the ingredients you’ll need, and the steps you’ll have to follow for a successful spell.

## What Is a Honey Jar Spell?

A honey jar spell operates in the spirit of its contents– it encourages sweetness between people. Practitioners use it to promote kindness and love, so it’s a pretty versatile spell.

 You can cast honey jar spells to coax someone into being nicer to you or someone else. You might use one to guide a boss into being more considerate. Or you could use it on yourself for better self-love and self-care.

 It’s a gentle kind of magic that heavily relies on positive and light energies. 

 If you’re worried about the [Wiccan rede](https://www.wiccangathering.com/wiccan-beliefs-for-beginners/) with honey jar spells, remember that they have quite a light touch. They do not force or compel action from any 3rd person.

 Rather, they are the gentlest reminder to the recipient– just a small nudge in the right direction.

 And they should always be used for light and positive purposes. Just imagine it– it would be very hard to do a negative spell involving sweet honey!

 ## Honey Jar Spell Ingredients

Preparation for a honey jar spell is not too complicated.

 The basic elements for different varieties of the spell remain the same, but you can tweak the other contents of the jar to match your specific purpose.

 To cast any honey jar spell, you’ll need to gather the following:

*   A small jar
*   A pen and paper
*   Honey*   Some herbs*   A candle*   Any other charms that boost your intent

We’ll talk about the purpose of each ingredient next, and give guidance as to the best materials to use according to your intent.

 ### Jar

Any jar works, but a small jar is convenient and portable.

 Color is important as well. You can use a clear or colored jar to your discretion. Clear jars are best for a wide range of spells, while colored jars boost specific intent.

 For example, if you’re casting a honey jar spell to promote self-love, you can use a pink-tinted jar. Similarly, if you’re doing the spell for a more peaceful relationship with someone, opt for a blue-shaded jar and so on.

 If you want to use a basic, clear jar but want something a bit smaller or more unique than your typical Mason jar, check out these:

 ### Pen and Paper

Next, you’ll need a pen and paper. Any kind of paper works, but if you’re planning on eating the honey after casting your spell, opt for a sandwich paper or an unbleached parchment paper.

 Meanwhile, you can use a standard black ink for your pen, or choose a colored ink according to your intent.

 ### Honey

Of course, a honey spell jar wouldn’t be complete without the honey itself. However, if you don’t have honey on hand or don’t want to use honey for ethical or dietary reasons, you can use another sweetener as an alternative. Here are some ideas:

 *   Unrefined raw sugar
*   Coconut sugar
*   Maple syrup
*   Agave syrup

### Herbs

The herbs you use will vary depending on your intent and what you hope to achieve from the honey jar spell.

For love, use:

 *   Basil
*   Thyme
*   Rosemary
*   Chamomile*   Lavender

To encourage happiness and friendship, use:

 To cast a spell for binding, use:

 *   Witch hazel
*   Knotweed
*   Spiderwort

To aid in communication, use:

 To protect people and things, use:

To boost fertility and growth, use:

 For health-related spells, use:

*   Ginger
*   Eucalyptus
*   Sage*   Thyme

Remember to pick appropriate herbs to boost your honey jar spell and don’t be afraid to combine herbs.

 For example, use herbs for love or friendship if you wish to work on self-love or to encourage appreciation between people. Likewise, use herbs for binding and communication if you’re trying to get people to be closer to each other, and herbs for health if you’re casting the honey jar spell to heal people.

### Candle

A candle will greatly enhance your honey jar spell.

 A standard white candle works just fine on a honey jar spell, but you can opt for a colored candle that represents your intent, too. Using the right shades in your spell boosts your spell’s potency. It also allows you to focus on your intent more.

 If you use a colored jar as well, consider the effect of both colors. Using the same color for both jar and candle will increase its potency. On the other hand, using different colors for each can create a more balanced, blended emphasis.

### Others

Besides herbs, you can also include other items for added effectiveness, emphasis, energy, or just personalization. Consider:

 *   Crystals
*   Glitter
*   Confetti
*   Charms and trinkets*   Personal items tied to a person in the spell*   Self-care items if working on yourself*   Meaningful keepsakes like jewelry or photographs

If you choose to add crystals to your honey jar, be sure to pick the ones that represent your intention, whether in correspondence or color.

 For example, use rose quartz, moonstone, calcite, or amber to boost any form of love, and opt for amazonite, pearl, turquoise, or sunstone to encourage harmony and happiness. Likewise, choose sodalite and citrine for better communication, and agate, jade, and garnet for wellness promotion.

## Casting a Honey Jar Spell

Once you have your ingredients, it’s time to cast your honey jar spell. To do so, do the following:

 1.  Prepare your ingredients and have them close to you once you start your spell.
*   Write the name of the person you’re casting the spell to on paper three times. **Don’t lift your pen off of the paper as you write.** To do this, write in cursive and don’t worry about dotting i’s or crossing t’s for now.*   Rotate your paper at a 90-degree angle but continue to keep your pen on the page. Write your name on top of the first name three times. Your name should cross the other person’s name, or your name if you’re casting the spell on yourself.*   Take in five deep breaths with your eyes closed.*   Open your eyes and focus on your intent as you stare at the paper.*   Write your intent as a circle around the name grid you’ve created.*   Your goal is to make a circle, so again don’t lift the pen as you write. Aim to have a complete circle once you’re done. You could simply write “happiness,” “love,” or “harmony” over and over as long as your intent is clear and the circle forms.*   Once you’re done, you can lift your pen off of the paper to add dots to your i’s or lines to your t’s.*   Fold your paper in half, facing the direction of the other person’s name. Rotate your paper at another 90-degree angle and fold it in half in the direction of your name this time.*   Fill your jar with all your spell items– honey, herbs, crystals, and any other charms.*   Submerge your paper into the honeyed jar. While doing so, state your intent. It could be as simple as *“Sweet honey, please aid in making (other person’s name) sweeter towards me. Just as you’re sweet, so shall (other person’s name) be. As is my will, so mote it be.”* Of course, you can tweak those lines as much as you want to suit your needs.*   Once you’re done, your finger should come off with some honey on it. Lick the honey off and close your jar. Savor its sweet taste.*   Place your candle on top of the honey jar and light it.*   Focus on your intention as the candle burns, and allow the candle to burn completely. Keep the candle wax on top of the jar even when you store the jar in a different spot. Light a candle and focus on your intent as much as you want on the following days or whenever you feel like it to reinforce your honey jar spell.

 ## What to Do With the Honey Jar

Once you’re done with the spell, you may wonder what to do with your honey jar.

 There’s no hard-and-fast rule as to where your honey jar should be kept after your spell is cast, so you can place it anywhere. You can keep it on your [altar](https://www.wiccangathering.com/basic-altar-setup-how-to-set-up-your-first-witch-altar/), bury it somewhere, put it in a freezer, leave it at a crossroads, or throw it within a body of water.

If you’d like to continue working on the spell or periodically reinforce it, the best choice is to keep your honey jar on your altar or somewhere in your home.

 However, to preserve the spell as-is and leave things as they are, then place the jar in your freezer.

 Another option is to bury the jar, or leave it somewhere that you won’t come across again. This can create a more permanent effect yet leaves the spell’s fate to other forces. So be mindful of that if you choose to bury or throw the jar.

## Final Thoughts

Casting a honey jar spell is easy once you get the hang of it. Just gather the right ingredients, determining your goal, focus, and trust things will work accordingly.
