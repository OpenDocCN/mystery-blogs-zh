 Get a white candle either a plain one (offertory, pillar, or taper) or a figural one in the gender of the person you want to bless. Carve the person's full name on the candle, then dress it with Blessing Oil or Holy Oil. For more power, you may place a name-paper of the person, or a photo, or some personal item of theirs (such as a bit of hair or a snippet of clothing) either under the candle or next to it. One easy way to do this is to place the paper or personal concerns under an overturned saucer and put the candle on top of the saucer. Burn a portion of the candle every day for seven days, pinching it out between burnings. As you light it each day, say this:

> > **" [Name] , may you be blessed May all good things come to you May nothing whatsoever harm you May your heart be light May your travels be safe May your health be good May your mind be sound May your friendships sustain you May you be blessed in every way."**

> *If you have a special request for this person (such as that they find a lover, get a good job, come home safely from a war, or whatever), just add it to the list. Some people use a large pillar-type candle and keep it going for longer than seven days. They may make a habit of burning such a candle every day -- or once a week, on Sundays -- for as long as their friend or relative needs help, even doing so for months at a time. If the candle is large and it is to be burned in this way, it should be re-dressed with Blessing Oil or Holy Oil once a week: after the initial dressing, you can drop a tiny bit of oil into the "well" or hole in such a large candle just before lighting it each time.

Hi! What if I dont have a holy/blessing oil can I just use the blessed water from the church (holy water)?

I personally wouldn't use water, as it will effect the way the candle burns. You can create your own dressing oil, by charging olive oil, or you can fully create blessing/holy oil with a recipe and steeping herbs in the oil for several weeks. Oils aren't a requirement in candle work, if you don't have the oil, your intention should be enough.
