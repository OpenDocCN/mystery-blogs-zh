 ## Casting Instructions for 'Threshold Protection Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 cloves of garlic

*   A handful of coarse sea salt

*   A handful of rosemary

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 cloves of garlic

*   A handful of coarse sea salt

*   A handful of rosemary

Stir everything together in a bowl, and leave on a windowsill during the night of a full moon. Hopefully it will be a clear night so the moonlight can touch your spell materials.

Then take the bowl outside, and spread the salt and herbs around the outside of your front door and any other doors in the house. The main door that you use should get the most of the mixture. For added protection, sprinkle a little on the window sills too.

If you live in an apartment, this spell can still be performed but the garlic smell will be noticeable if you sprinkle too much on your door to the hallway.
