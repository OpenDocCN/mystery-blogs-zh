Laugh, and dance, and drink the wine outpoured

In the dear green earth, blessed by the Lady and the Lord.

May both be consecrated with the strength of the skies

With the brightness of the Moon, and the warmth of the Sun.

With the splendor of fire and the speed of lightning,

The depth of the sea, the vigour of the wind,

The stability of earth and the endurance of rock.

Like fruit in the summer, your love is bursting forth.

United by the quarters: East, South, West and North.

May your love grow without end, as the sacred circle that is a wedding ring.

A symbol of the power contained within your hearts.

A true relationship is patient and kind, generous and trusting,

and true love protects and perseveres through each season of life.

Blessed be this union,

Today and every day,

May joy fill every room

With sunlight or with rain.
