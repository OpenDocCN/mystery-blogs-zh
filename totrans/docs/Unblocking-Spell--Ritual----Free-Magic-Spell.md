**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 bowl

*   Seawater or rainwater

*   Your tears

*   Your favorite plant

*   1 pen

*   1 paper

*   1 crystal

First, fill the bowl with seawater or rainwater.

Cry into the bowl of water. It is ''living'' water because it came directly from the earth(this is very important!).

When you can't cry anymore, take the water and feed your favorite plant with it.

Nurture this plant; tell it your desires and dreams.

Write your wishes and dreams on a pieces of paper and bury them together with a small crystal beside the plant's roots. As the plant grows, also will your goals and dreams...
