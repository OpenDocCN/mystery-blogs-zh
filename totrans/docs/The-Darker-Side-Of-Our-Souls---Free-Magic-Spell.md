 ## Casting Instructions for 'The Darker Side Of Our Souls'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Anthill

*   Cane

*   Benzoic incense

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Anthill

*   Cane

*   Benzoic incense

 First, one must find a large single anthill located far away from general public and go to the location on a full moon night, preferably on a Thursday night. One should also bring a cane and some benzoic incense.

At the anthill and under the full moonlight, find a position where ones shadow casts directly onto the anthill. When a suitable location is fixed, burn the benzoic incense and start hitting the shadow with the cane. For every strike, say to the shadow: "Hey shadowy one, come to me!" The action should be repeated until a response is obtained: a gust of cold wind, a sound or even the shadow itself comes alive

One should persist through the ritual until the cane frays. When it did frayed and still no result, then one should come back the next full moon. According to the grand nanny who taught me this method that result will be normally be obtained within 3 tries.

She also said that this is another way of getting ones Hantu Raya or you may call it a Huge Spirit, a Wandering Spirit or anything else as it doesnt matter.
