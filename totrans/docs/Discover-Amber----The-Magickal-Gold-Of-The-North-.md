Hi and welcome to Wicca Now. As you may already know, Wicca Now is a site where Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/), this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or this article on [moldavite.](https://wiccanow.com/moldavite-the-spiritual-synergist/) Today I thought we’d focus on another beautiful “crystal”, namely amber.

## About Amber

**Amber is not actually a crystal but rather the fossilized resin of ancient pine trees. Amber has fascinated humans since antiquity and stores of amber have been found in caves dating back to the stone age. Amber was often used throughout the ancient world and was regarded as the ‘gold of the north’. The Etruscans made ornaments and jewellery out of amber and wore these as talismans. The ancient Greeks believed that amber was formed from the tears of the daughters of the sun god Helios, who cried after the death of their brother Phaethon. Amber has a pleasing scent when burned and was favoured as an incense through ancient Asia. In medieval Europe, amber was believed to protect against sorcery and necklaces made from beads of amber were often placed on babies in order to offer them protection from harm.**

Amber ranges in colour from pale yellow through to brown and reddish-brown. It can be translucent to opaque and has a vitreous lustre. Amber can actually become electrically charged (like tourmaline or topaz) and is therefore prone to attracting dust.
