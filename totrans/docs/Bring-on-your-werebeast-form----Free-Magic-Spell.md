Seed it vampire, werewolves l, werebeasts are real.

Roleplaying is against site rules.

Didn't work starting to agree with Nekoshema but still have hope.

if you wish to keep trying, go for it. just don't stubbornly stick to a mindset if you've discovered a different viewpoint. When I started out, I thought I could control elements if I concentrated enough and move objects with my mind. I discovered while I could make a candle flame flicker, or if I focused enough energy I could affect the weather, the ability to control the elements with my mind wasn't possible. I felt silly for believing it, but after discovering what was possible, I could focus on working spells and improve my craft. If you still have your doubts that what we're saying isn't true, keep researching and trying [just avoid any spell that promotes things like self-harm or drinking something which would make you sick]

You cannot physically transform into a werebeast.
