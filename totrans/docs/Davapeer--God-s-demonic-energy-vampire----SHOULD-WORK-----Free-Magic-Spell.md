I have now developed my own holy version of a vampire called a Davapeer. And my version looks like a golden--winged angel, and feeds off of demonic energy as well as makes snacks off of demonic corruption.

Davapeers literally eat demons and the like for breakfast

You cannot become a Davapeer.

is that because OP literally created this creature because isn't that how servitors work?

It states in the spells description it turns you into a Davapeer. If this person is creating a servitor, then I would say there is a chance of this working since you design the creature and create it with your energy. However, the first line explaining the spell clearly says ''turns you into'' which indicates physically transformation, hence my comment. If someone uses this to create a servitor, it might work.

the author didn't write about 'why it should work'? and write '(should work)' on the title, so this is not working, because if the author really care about viewers, it must be explanation why and how. its like say something and want person just do it without thinking, which is not good.
