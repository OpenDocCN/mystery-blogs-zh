## Casting Instructions for 'Cry of the Sea Love Symbol'

 **Intro:**
This spell will teach you how to enchant and create your own Symbol, a powerful object that will strengthen your magical abilities. The most important part is to believe in yourself, and that will give your Symbol the most strength. Remember, the Symbol will represent you. If you are close with water, then you will have a much easier time, as this spell has been passed down from many generations. Good luck with the spell!

**Preparation:**
Make sure you are in a quiet place. Slow your breathing down, concentrate, and make sure you are truly centered. Close you eyes, and imagine that you are floating. Floating down a river, peaceful, calm, ready. Open your eyes. You are now ready to complete the spell.

**Instructions:**
**1**. Pour the seawater into the glass bowl until the bowl is three quarters full.
**2**. Close your eyes. Pick up your Symbol carefully. Carefully place it over your heart, holding it in place.
**3**. Open your eyes. Take your Symbol, and blow on it gently. Then, place your Symbol into the bowl of seawater.
**4**. Light the blue candle, and then put out its flame by gently dunking it in the seawater.
**5**. Remove your Symbol from the bowl, and without drying it, place it onto the white smooth stone. If the Symbol is too big, place them side by side, making sure they're touching.
**6**. Place the length of silk over the bowl of seawater, then pour exactly 2 drops of water onto the silk.
**7**. Light the red candle. Let Symbol air dry.

**Chant this Spell:**

**To the God of the Oceans, to the Goddess of the Seas,
May my lowly prayer for attention be heard.
I cry for thy blessings, for love, my pleas,
Only those as powerful as you have what I've treasured.
Make this piece of coal, into the diamond I've hoped for!
Power it up with light and dark, powers of love and hate!
I beg for thy mercy, but you have what I've treasured,
May my lowly prayer for attention be heard.**

**8**. Pick up your Symbol, and once again place it over your heart. Blow out the red candle.
**9**. Blow on your Symbol again, and place it back on or near the stone. Let it air dry completely.

After drying, your Symbol is now ready! It has been charged with a magic spell thousands of years old, passed down from a great siren, the first siren, Syrena. It will strengthen your magic, power up your casts, but most importantly, it will attract your love to you. Show your love your Symbol, if you can. The closer the Symbol is to the person, the more potent it is!
