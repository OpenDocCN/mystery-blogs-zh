# A Heart Filled with Magic

Magic can keep love alive and fresh, enhancing our inherent charms. We must be responsible, however, and not turn love spells and potions into a game. They are serious business and can act as an astral roadmap to guide the right person into your life.

Several ingredients are necessary for creating reliable love magic. The first is faith in your magic and yourself. Without faith, magic becomes an exercise in futility. The second is intention. Without purpose and direction, magical energy disperses back to the source.

The third part of the equation is detachment. Detach yourself from preconceived notions of Mr. or Ms. “Right.” Allow the universe to open its possibilities to you. Detach yourself from your physical ideal and concentrate on the emotional qualities you want in a mate. Love begins in the heart, not your eyes and sometimes what you see is not what you get.

Also, once you’ve completed a love spell, detach the magic itself. Without this release, like a tethered balloon, the energy will never fly. If you’re using love magic to draw a mate, you may still meet a few toads before finding that prince or princess. If you’re using it to improve an established relationship, use honesty as your tinder to get those sparks burning.

# Seeking Love

Love seems to play hide-and-seek with those actively pursuing it. And the rules of the game constantly change according to social and personal attitudes. This makes the quest a challenge, but one which spellcraft can meet successfully. Just remember that you are responsible for any relationship that develops as a result of magical fostering.

Relationships are intricate and delicate. Magic will not, in itself, make or break a potential or ongoing relationship. It simply provides a nudge or spark. The rest is up to you.

## Clearing Love’s Path

Love’s road is often full of blocks and potholes. A little magic, however, can clear the way. Begin by bathing in carnation petals and bay leaves. This dispels negativity and makes you more open to receiving love. Then write your wish for love on a small piece of parchment, visualizing pink light saturating the paper. Take this outside at midnight, and concentrate on any single star, saying:

*“Oh star, whose silver light ignites my wish a’fire,
grant me my heart’s desire!
Make clear the way for finding love.
Bless this wish from up above.”*

Wear he paper in your left shoe until the magic manifests, then burn it with thankfulness.

## Love Thyself

Before others can love you, you must learn to love yourself. This is hard because we are often our own worst critics. But to foster love, it has to start within. To help accomplish this, bless an apple, saying three times, *Fruit of wholeness, be filled with confidence and love.* Eat the apple and begin internalizing loving self-acceptance, then plant the seeds so this positive image can grow.

## Attracting More Love

Is there ever too much love? Bring a little more love into your life. Anoint a pink or red candle with an aromatic oil of your choice. Tack the center of the candle with a rose thorn. Blend some silver glitter with rose petals and take the mixture and candle to your threshold. To attract a man, perform this spell on a Friday; to attract a woman, work on Tuesday.

Stand at your threshold and light the candle. Adhere it to the floor nearby so your hands are free. Walk outside, a few paces from your doorway, and begin sprinkling the glitter and petals on your walkway, saying:

*“Follow the light to me.
I release love to the winds so it can return.
Within my heart, this candle always burns.”*

If possible (and safe), let the candle burn out naturally. Save the wax remnants with any remaining glitter as a charm to draw love into your life.

## Moon Glamoury

According to an old English custom, the moon can improve one’s image. Stand beneath a waxing crescent moon and say:

*“Silver moon, magic moon, shine in my hair,
silver moon, bright moon, magic to me bear,
silver moon, magic moon, make me fair!”*

Repeat this phrase each time you see the moon until it reaches fullness. The magic will begin manifesting then, and others will find you more attractive.

## Drawing a Lover

When you’re looking for someone with whom to share intimate moments, but not necessarily a lifetime, try this spell. Make two poppets (small cloth figurines) out of cloth dabbed with patchouli oil, and stuff them with verbena, vervain, yarrow, and rose petals. Set one across the room from the other on the first night of a waxing moon. Place a deep red or purple candle near your bed.

Each night, light the candle, saying this incantation three times, *“Draw me to my lover, draw us close together.”* Afterward, physically move the dolls closer together. On the night of the full moon, have the dolls meet. Bind them loosely (so the magic doesn’t constrain) with a white ribbon and store them under your bed until the magic manifests.

## Drawing a Lifemate

If you are looking for someone for a long-term relationship, an acorn can become your potent symbol. In ancient proverbs, this represented prolonged effort that lead to achievement. Plant an acorn in rich soil where it has room to grow, while strongly visualizing your wish for lasting love. Tend to this with as much care as you would a relationship. When the acorn has taken root and begins sprouting, some potential partners should make themselves known.

## Deterring a Rival

Is someone perpetually standing in the way of your relationships? Go to an area of mud or dirt, such as a park, where your rival has been walking. When they leave the area, rub out one of their footprints, saying:

*“Turn away from what I love,
may your interest disappear
as this footprint from the earth.
If it be for the greatest good, and harm none
by my will, this spell’s begun.”*

# Deepening Love

The level of commitment in a relationship-be it with a friend, lover, or potential life mate−can benefit from a magical boost. However, make sure your partner is as interested as you are in taking this step. Otherwise, magic can become manipulative or sticky with possessiveness.

## Commitment

Commitment can apply to jobs, animals, and people, so this spell can be altered to fit the circumstance. Begin with a picture or personal item that represents the person or situation which you feel needs greater commitment. Hold this in your hands on the first night of a full moon. Visualize a red string extending from your heart chakra to this person or situation. Do not “glue” this to them, just offer it. Over the next two nights, repeat the visualization beneath the moon’s beams. As you do, add an incantation to empower the visualization, such as:

*“From my heart to _________ (fill in with person/situation),
I offer a working partnership, a sharing.
If this be your desired,
take hold this string, and begin caring.”*

Keep the picture or object with you as a charm. It will help manifest this commitment if it’s meant to be.

## Unity

Two people do not enter into oneness overnight, sometimes not even over a lifetime. This spell will develop unity between people. Begin by making each other a braided bracelet of red, blue, and yellow string adding some strands of your hair. Along the bracelet, tie three knots saying”

*“In this gift, love, trust, and insight combine.
With this thread my magic wind.
Within the knot, my love I bind.”*

Exchange your bracelets during the second night of a full moon, tying them on with three knots, symbolizing body, mind, and soul in harmony. If you can’t easily wear a bracelet at the workplace, consider tying it around your ankle, or put it inside a wallet or other item that you carry regularly.

## Harmony with In-laws

Even the best relationship suffers when the couple’s two families are at odds. This spell will help in-laws to be more tolerant of each other. Begin with pictures of all the individuals involved, if possible. Or find an item to represent each person.

Lay out a large white cloth (symbolizing peace) and put the pictures/items in the center. Fold in one corner of the cloth at a time, beginning on the northern side, saying”

*“The cool winds blow to calm anger.”*
On the west side, saying:
*“The waves smooth all discord.”*
On the south side, saying:
*“The fires are quenched, bitterness ceased.”*
On the east side, saying:
*“Fresh winds blow with forgiveness and understanding.”*
Keep the pictures/tokens bound together until the situation resolves.

## Increasing Love

For a couple wishing to increase their love, each should take a lock of the other’s hair. Holding the lock, recite the name of your loved one three times. Carry the hair as a charm to keep love burning in your heart.

## Increasing Love #2

In Indonesia, lovers wear something belonging to their beloved to increase the love between them. Exchange items during a waxing moon so your love grows to fullness. During the exchange, cooperatively pour warm water on your threshold. This “warms” the way for love each time either of you enters your house.

## Decreasing Jealousy

Nothing kills romance faster than the green-eyed monster. To combat this negative energy, attach an image of your partner to one end of a strand of green yarn, preferably a shade you dislike. Snip off sections of the yarn leading to the image, while saying:

*“I release jealousy and envy.
I release mistrust and suspicion.
I release you.”*

As you recite the last line of this incantation, snip the yarn away from the image. Burn the yarn so you can’t reconnect with any bad energy.

## Calling Back a Stray Lover

This spell should not be used to force an unwilling partner to return. Instead, it acts as a gentle nudge to bring back someone who has gotten waylaid by circumstances or a rival.

Find a small amount of the herb called dragon’s blood. Burn this on wood or paper on a fire safe surface. Speak the person’s name three times. Then say:
 *“_____ (fill in with name) return to me
if it be your heart’s desire.
I open the way with this magical fire.
Hear my voice, but your will remains free.
Today ____ pray, you come back to me.”*

Let the herb burn out. Afterward, you may want to call that person and ask to talk over your relationship in a neutral area.

# Maintaining Love

Adding a spiritual dimension to relationships keeps connections strong, even when your time together is limited. When you feel temptation beckoning, use love magic to steer your attention back where it belongs.

Integrating Change

Relationships that never change will never grow, although the process of change isn’t always easy. When you’ve gone through a harrowing transition in your relationship, this spell will smooth the road ahead.

Place a red candle in a fire-safe container (like a small lantern). Alternatively, use a red flashlight with the light facing the ceiling. From the right to left side of your light source, mark the floor with white tape. The taped line and light mark the boundary between the old way and the beginning of the new.

Stand with your mate, hand-in-hand, on one side of the line. Take turns reciting an incantation such as:

*“The past is behind us,
the future before us.
By crossing this line we mark and accept change.
Using the past as a teacher, not a burden,
looking to the future with hope, not anxiety,
we take the leap of faith together.”*

The last line of this incantation should be recited in unison as you both jump over the line. Blow out the candle and bury it (or ritually dispose of the flashlight batteries) to resolve any old tensions or bad feelings.

## Family Feuds

You’ve heard the old adage, “You can’t choose your family.’’ But you can choose to reestablish harmony with them, using magic to smooth the way. This spell can also be used to heal rifts between friends.

Each person needs a white candle and small container of salve. Place a third white candle, the peace candle, between you. Each person lights their candle on the table. In turn, each reaches forward to the central candle and dabs a bit of salve on the wax, saying,

*“Let healing begin.
Where anger dwells, bring forgiveness within.”*

Both people light the peace candle together, then blow out their personal candle as a sign of truce. This symbolically quells the fire of anger. Sit in the light of the peace candle and talk things out.

## Fertility Formula

Fertility magic helps us create the energy necessary to welcome a new life, even if a child is not born to the couple but adopted. The week before enacting this spell, rest more, eat well, and begin making room and time for a child in your life. Through this week, follow the Italian custom of eating one consecrated apple per day to increase fertility. To bless the apple, say:

*“Great Spirit, bless this fruit
that our union might also be fruitful.”*

On the last day of the week, have a quiet, romantic, tender time together. Light a yellow candle near the bed (representing creativity). As you make love, visualize the cresting energy directed toward the woman’s womb or any documents associated with an adoption. Let the candle burn completely out, but save the wax.

Soften the wax remnants in a microwave or on the stove and fashion it into the rough likeness of a baby. Swaddle it in warm, white cloth to protect your magic until it manifests.

## Forgiveness

A forgiveness spell diffuses anger, using love’s energy like an astral salve. It can open the way for healing when one party refuses to speak to the other. You will need something of the other person’s (e.g., something that person touched or wore).

In a wooden bowl, mix together sandalwood oil, water, and rose water, stirring counterclockwise and saying:

*“Banish the anger, banish the negativity.
Let my heart and this house be free.”
Stop stirring and focus on your intention to release any lingering bad feelings you may have, then stir clockwise, saying:*

“Let our minds and hearts open.
Let our ears be open.
Replace the pain with receptivity
_________ (individual’s name) please speak with me.”

Visualize this person’s face superimposed on the item they touched or wore. Sprinkle the water mixture on it. As this dries, wash your threshold with the remaining water mixture dispelling any negativity and opening the way for love.

## Perking Up Passion

Begin with tempestuous music playing in the background and any passion-related incense. Light a candle whose color reminds you of intimate moments.

Sit in front of the candle and watch the flame. As it dances and burns, whisper:

*“Fire within; passion within.
Burn with desire, let my magic begin.”*

Keep repeating this phrase and close your eyes, holding the image of the candle’s flame in your mind. Visualize the flame growing and slowly moving down through your body, exciting every cell. Continue the visualization until you feel ready to burst. Take that energy and enthusiasm into your lovemaking.

# Letting Go

When love goes awry, or comes to a natural end, it is often hard to let go. This is the purpose of the following spells.

## Giving Space

The first step in a separation is to create distance−physical and spiritual. This spell is designed to provide spiritual protection as an emotional bumper, which will also help keep unwanted attentions at bay.

Halfway down the middle of a silver candle, carve a symbol you equate with protection and safety. Before going to bed, light the candle for a few minutes. Use the following incantation, filling in the blank with the name of the person from whom you’re separating. Say:

*“Light of silver, like a mirror,
reflect sadness away, only good memories stay.
Between me and _______ put a wall of energy
so both of us might be free.”*

As you go to sleep, visualize silver light surrounding you on all sides and extending out like a shield. Repeat this spell each night until the candle has burned out completely.

## Banishing Unwanted Attention

When someone showers you with undesired affection, to deflect the energy, write the name of the person backwards on a piece of paper and tear it in seven pieces. Burn one piece each night during a waning moon, over seven days. As the paper burns, say,

*“Your attentions avert, your attachment release.
By my will and my words, let your love for me cease!”*

Save the ashes from the burnt paper. On the last night bury the ashes at least seven miles away from your residence. If necessary repeat the spell during the next waning moon.

## Mending a Broken Heart

The human heart is more fragile than we like to admit. It hurts when people are harsh, critical, grumpy, or inconsiderate. It hurts even more when we’ve been rejected. Use this magic spell as a bandage to cover your heart’s wound until it heals.

You will need a bandage and some lavender oil. Work during a waning moon so your sadness “shrinks.” Take the bandage in one hand and dab a little lavender oil on the cotton part, saying:
“Where pain has been, let healing begin.

*“Direct to my heart, peace impart.
Let the past Fade away, so I can love today”.*

Wear the bandage over your heart until it falls off by itself. By this time, you should begin feeling better.

## Releasing Ties

In a relationship you create astral ties to the other person through exchanged energy. This spell will release those strands so healing can begin for both people.

Find two gray candles and about three feet of gray thread. Tie one end of the thread to one candle and the other end to the second candle. Pull it taut between them. Light both candles, and take a knife or a pair of scissors in hand, saying:

*“I now release what once was bound.
May healing begin, and peace be found.
Freely detached, your heart and mine,
your mind and mine,
your spirit and mine.”*

Cut the thread, winding the excess around each candle. Keep one in a safe place (this represents you). Bury the second to represent the emotional and spiritual distance you’ve placed between yourself and that person.
