## Mercury Retrograde Meaning

So what does it mean when Mercury is in retrograde?

The term retrograde comes from the Latin word retrogradus, which literally means “backward step.”

When a planet is in retrograde, it looks as if it is moving backward when viewed from the Earth.

It’s an optical illusion caused by the Earth’s rotation and the speed of orbit around the Sun of the other planets.

It happens when Earth moves faster around the Sun than another planet, that planet appears to travel backward as compared to the stars.

When Mercury is in retrograde, for many people, things begin to go bad.

It seems like a string of bad luck:

*   Your car breaks down
*   You lose your wallet
*   You fry your computer
*   You break up with your significant other
*   You fight with friends

Mercury is associated with the Greed god it was named after.

Mercury the god govens transportation and communication.

When the planet travels backward, its power to positively influence those things it governs is stifled.

It’s a time when one should be more cautious when speaking or travelling, double checking things, and maybe putting off bigger decisions until the retrograde is over.

## What NOT To Do During Mercury Retrograde

Don’t accept a new job, and avoid doing any interviews at this time. Communication issues will hamper your chances of success.

Don’t buy technology or install new tech accessories. Hold onto that new stick of RAM until the retrograde is over!

Drive less. Car problems are very common during Mercury retrograde, so when you can, walk or use your bike. You’ll [save money](https://eclecticwitchcraft.com/find-financial-freedom-with-this-spell-to-save-money/) by not having to repair a blown tire or damage from a crash!

Don’t start a new business. Communication issues will make things turn sour.

Don’t move homes. You may find that what seemed like the perfect home actually had many issues!

Don’t travel away from home. Cancellations, postponements, and delays will hound you!

Limit large purchases. You’ll probably end up with buyers remorse!
