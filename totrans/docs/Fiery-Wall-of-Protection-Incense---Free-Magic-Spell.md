Ingredients:

*   Sea salt
*   Frankincense resin powder
*   Myrrh resin powder
*   Dragon's blood powder

Instructions:
Blend all of the ingredients (sea salt, frankincense resin powder, myrrh resin powder, dragon's blood powder) together with a mortar and pestle (or anything you prefer).

When the powder is added to oil, Fiery Wall of Protection Oil is created. Some variations may suggest adding ground ginger and cinnamon, you could also add some if you prefer to. Just be aware that these are skin irritants and may limit the uses of the oil. Without these ingredients, Fiery Wall can added to the bath or burn as an incense.
