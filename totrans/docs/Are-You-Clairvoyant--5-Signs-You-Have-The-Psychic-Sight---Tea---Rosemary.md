# Are You Clairvoyant? 5 Signs You Have The Psychic Sight | Tea & Rosemary

> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/clairvoyant-clairvoyance-psychic-sight/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/clairvoyant-clairvoyance-psychic-sight/#0001-01-01)

The word “psychic” is thrown around so often that it’s easy to misuse it. Someone who is *psychic* will receive psychic information through one of the many senses, so there are multiple different types of psychics.

The main ways you can have psychic senses are through:

*   Clairvoyance: seeing
*   Clairaudience: hearing
*   Clairsentience: feeling
*   Clairalience: smelling
*   Clairgustance: tasting
*   Claircognizance: knowing

I plan on doing a segment on each of the “Clairs,” but this specific post will focus on Clairvoyance, which is psychic *sight.*

Let me start by saying that I truly believe everybody is psychic in one way or another. I think that we are all capable of developing each of the these skills, but certain senses will come more naturally to each of us.

I’ll talk about the 5 indicators that you have natural clairvoyance in this post, but if you don’t have all of the indicators, you can certainly still develop psychic sight. It will take a bit more work but it’s certainly possible.

If you’re just starting to develop your psychic abilities, I recommend focusing on the sense that comes the most naturally to you. You can now easily consult the [best psychics online at thedailyworld.com](https://www.thedailyworld.com/national-marketplace/best-psychic-reading-online-100-free-psychic-readings-on-love-career-and-personal-life-matters/).

I find that most people possess multiple psychic senses, but are often strong with either *hearing* or *seeing.* Sometimes a person has both equally strong, but (in my experience) this is rare. See if these signs apply to you and if psychic sight is something you may want to develop.

Without further ado, here are the 5 indicators that you have *strong* natural psychic sight, otherwise known as clairvoyance!

## 5\. You Create A Picture In Your Head When Hearing A Story Or Reading

Imagine a friend is telling you a story about what happened to them over the weekend. Are you picturing the scene in your mind’s eye? This is a sign of clairvoyance.

Another clear sign is attempting to picture the scene when you’re reading a book. This gets me in a bit of trouble when I eventually watch the movie version of a book because it’s never exactly what I pictured, but this is helpful if you’re working to develop clairvoyance!

## 4\. You See Floaters Out Of The Corner Of Your Eye

Do you ever see something move out of the corner of your eye? It could be sparkly light, colorful light, or even little black floaters. This is often an indication of clairvoyance.

The idea is that it’s much easier to see energy (or spirits) when you let your guard down, so you may tend to see this light out of the corner of your eye first because you aren’t focusing on it.

## 3\. You Visualize First When Meditating

Do you find it easy to visualize when you’re meditating? If this is how you tend to start off your visualizations then that is a clear sign of clairvoyance.

If you’re unsure, search for a guided meditation on YouTube. Sit down, close your eyes, and follow along. See if you instantly picture something, or if you draw in the picture through other senses (noises, smells, etc.). Notice how vivid your picture is and how easily you are able to conjure it.

Another way to test this is to do a past life regression. If you’re easily able to visualize your past life then you definitely have some clairvoyance. If you tend to hear or *know* rather than see, you may want to explore other psychic avenues first.

## 2\. You Sometimes See Energy Or Auras

Do you ever see colors above someone’s head? This is a clear indicator of clairvoyance. You may also see energy moving in a room (where there should be only air) which is another sign.

If you don’t tend to see auras or energy without really trying, don’t worry too much – you may need to develop your psychic sight further (this can be one of the last things to come) or you may have other senses that are stronger.

## 1\. Your Dreams Are Visual

One of the first signs of clairvoyance, even in children, is super visual dreams. You may be in a varied layout in a dream that you’ve never seen in real life. This is a clear indicator of psychic sight, especially if your dreams are always different, visual, and colorful.
