- add the 3 tablespoons of sugar to the bowl

- add the 3 tablespoons of sea salt to the bowl

- with the hand you did not extract your blood from, stir the contents in the bowl with that hand and fingers and think of what your summoning Malice for.

- after stirring the content of the bowl recite this spell: ''Malice The Lifegiver, I call upon thee for your great wisdom. please answer my call and accept my offering in return for your great wisdom to help me in my hour of need. I need your wisdom to help me with (reason you need his guidance or assistance). please answer my call and give me the knowledge/help of which I seek.''

- after reciting the incantation, rub the potion on your arms and forehead.

- focus on his pure energy and then put out the candles with the potion.

- once the candles are out, clean up the ritual area and leave the offering to malice outside or near a place he can reach it. go to sleep and check on the offering next day, if it is gone then he has accepted your request and took the offering. if you asked him for knowledge, then you will receive his wisdom in your dreams next day.

good luck with the spell fellow spellcasters

this isn't a thing, and if you wanted to summon a Dragon, salt, sugar and water wouldn't do anything.

This is fake, it does not work.
