Creates a charm to give you courage.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Courage is What I Crave Charm'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Small object you want to enchant

*   2 candles (can be fake)

*   A flat surface

 Put your small object on the flat surface and put a candle on either side of it. Light the candles. Imagine yourself doing 3 courageous things.

Sing this chant (you don't have to sing it, I just find that it helps raise the proper energy): ''Candles with your light, make this charm shine bright. When I carry this charm, I will be brave. Let me have my wish, as courage is what I crave. When someone needs to be protected, they will come to me. This is my will, so mote it be.''

Repeat step 2\. Put out the candles.
