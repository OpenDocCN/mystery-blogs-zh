## Casting Instructions for 'Vanity Insanity, A Curse for the Vain...'

 Sometimes we come across people in our lives that we cannot stand because these people are so vein and they think that they are better than you, just because they were blessed with extremely good looks. It's one thing if they are good looking but it is another thing if they go around acting like they know it. If you are like me, then it is time to knock them off their high horse. I personally hate people like this and would like nothing better than for these people to wake up in the morning and look in the mirror saying I hate myself and my looks! Oh my, this is a great spell and there are so many people deserving of it.

Instructions:

Take hair and nail clippings and a picture of the one you wish to punish. Take the picture and write the words “Beauty and Charm” on it with a black magic marker. Place all this in your cauldron and set it on fire. You will want to do this outside so in order to protect you from carbon monoxide poisoning and or burning your house down. As the fire starts to burn, read the following incantation.

“(Persons name) whom I now see 
you'll go insane from vanity. 
You'll see yourself as others do 
all your looks are gone from you. 
What was is gone and now is true 
all your beauty will flee from you. 
You look in the mirror, yourself to tend 
your youthful face has come to an end. 
Your mighty ego now is broken 
you'll go insane in that same token. 
I take this all away from you 
because of all the things you do. 
Once you thought you were so great 
I bring you down to meet your fate. 
The smell of stench is in the air 
around you now, you'll lose your hair 
In your mind you'll go insane 
vanity is now your pain.” 

“I accept this now manifesting by the powers of the Deities that rule the Darkest of the Abyss. Lucifer, Belzebut and Astarot. Aid me in my endeavors and carry out my wishes. So be it!”

Take the ashes and place them in a small bag or container. The reason you want to save every bit of this is so that you can place the ashes around your victims house. If you are someone who does go in this persons house that will be all the better, for you can sprinkle them around the inside of the house in different places.

After you have read the incantation, you will want to sit and meditate on the curse and visualize all these things happening to the victim of your choosing. When you are done meditating for a few minutes, make sure the fire is completely out and return to your nightly affairs.
