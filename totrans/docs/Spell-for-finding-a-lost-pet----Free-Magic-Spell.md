# Spell for finding a lost pet.

A short little spell I learned that I figured I'd give out to you all involving tarot cards!

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A tarot deck.

*   2-3 candles, preferably pink.

*   A picture or item associated with the animal.

## Casting Instructions for 'Spell for finding a lost pet.'

So before we begin this spell it would be best to meditate on your animal for 10 minutes or so, so as to relax yourself and be able to concentrate on who you're looking for. When you feel relaxed enough to begin, light the two or three candles and set them either parallel to each other with a foot of space if 2, or a triangle formation with about a foot of space with 3\. So using the tarot deck, figure out the signifacator card of your pet. Cards that can be used as significators for animals include the 9 OF PENTACLES, THE STAR, and the ACE OF CUPS for birds; the QUEEN OF WANDS for cats; STRENGTH for domestic cats and big cats like lions and tigers; THE MOON, THE FOOL, and the 10 OF PENTACLES for dogs and wolves; the PAGE OF CUPS and The MOON for fish and aquatic life; THE SUN, the 6 OF WANDS, and all of the KNIGHTS for horses; the KING OF WANDS for lizards and reptiles, the QUEEN OF PENTACLES for rabbits; and THE LOVERS for snakes. However, if a particular card feels right for your animal, feel free to use that instead!

So the cards we will be using are the significator, the Star, the 6 of cups, the Magician, and the Hermit.

So now that we have all that figured out, in the center of the candles place down the significator. Visualize the animal, recalling its features and mannerisms to the best of your ability. Picture the missing pet being drawn to the light of the candles--to the light of love. Hold your hands above the candle flames for a few moments. Feel the warmth of the candles, and visualize the light of the candles acting as a beacon to lead the animal home.

Afterwards, lay down the SIX OF CUPS, and think about all of the good times you and your pet have had together. Try to remember the day you first got your pet, what they were like as a youngster, etc.

As you lay down THE MAGICIAN, consider the various courses of action that may be taken in the search for your pet.

Lay down THE STAR, a card for wishing. Make a wish for your pet to return.

Finally, lay down THE HERMIT, visualizing your pet being found or returned, and how happy you both will be to be reunited.

After you have finished meditating on the cards and visualizations, carefully, and with as much feeling as you can, recite the following affirmation:

''As I set forth these cards in the light of these candles, the small friend for whom I have so much love is drawn home to me!

I do not cease trying to find my friend until he/she returns home.

I call upon all good spirits and all good powers who care about small and helpless creatures to aid me in my search!

My small friend (name of pet) is brought home through the spell which I call forth.

It shines like a beacon that my animal friend can see!

As my will, so mote it be!''

You may consider the spell closed at this point, or you may close the spell as desired.
