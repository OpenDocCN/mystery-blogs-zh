what kind of pins are recommended?

Pins used to hold fabric together works fine, just cleanse them first so the energy you charge them with is specifically for this spell and not all the times in the past you used the pins for sewing.

would sewing needles work okay?

Works the same, just cleanse and charge it.

should I allow the candle to burn down or snuff it out after saying the stuff?

This spell worked for me within about a 1-2 weeks after. I said it one time and waited. I also didnt use any of the required items. Believe in yourself and the universe.

i did this spell and it worked within 24-48 hours. I didnt use a candle or pins, i just sat on the ground and held onto my quartz stone

also i mean to say i tried it 2 times ^ the first time took longer
