Colors:

*   Fire: red, yellow, orange
*   Water: any blues
*   Earth: green, brown
*   Air: light blue, tan, white

Take your sting, it needs to be pretty long, and make a finger-crochet bracelet(It's really simple but hard to explain so if you don't know how look up a YouTube video.) but do not tie it yet.

Relax yourself and focus on the bracelet. then, say the words:
"I ask for this bracelet to bring good luck
to the one that wears it on their wrist
for they should know just when to duck
when they have been abandoned by their wits"

Tie the bracelet, put it on your wrist, and it will bring you good luck whenever you wear it.
