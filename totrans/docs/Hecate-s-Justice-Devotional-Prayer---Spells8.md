# Hecate’s Justice Devotional Prayer – Spells8

> 来源：[https://spells8.com/hecate-devotional/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/hecate-devotional/#0001-01-01)

Hecate is the Greek goddess of Magic, sorcery, witchcraft, crossroads, and necromancy, although originally she was the goddess of the wilds, the moon, and childbirth. Her Roman counterpart is Trivia. Learn more about Hecate in this lesson: [Hecate: Goddess Symbols & Myth](https://spells8.com/lessons/hecate-goddess-symbols/).

Hecate is the Divinity of the Underworld who is called the Queen of the night and Goddess of the crossroads. Her three faces turn in all possible directions, and she is often seen with torches.

Some believe that Hecate grants wealth and success to those whose prayers she receives favorably. In the same way, the result of war and victory in games may depend on her, who grants glory to whomever she pleases. This power resembles that of Witchcraft, as Medea – a powerful priestess of Hecate – used to handle magical herbs and poisons with this skill.

I call Hecate of the Crossroads,

worshipped at the meeting of three paths, oh lovely one.

In the sky, earth, and sea, you are venerated in your saffron-colored robes.

Funereal daemon, celebrating among the souls of those who have passed.

Persian, fond of deserted places, you delight in deer.

Goddess of night, protectress of dogs, invincible Queen.

Drawn by a yoke of bulls, you are the queen who holds the keys to all the Cosmos.

Commander, Nymph, nurturer of children, you who haunt the mountains.

Pray, Maiden, attend our hallowed rituals;

Be forever gracious to your mystic herdsman and rejoice in our gifts of incense.

Hecate, pleased with dark ghosts that wander through the shade, nightly seen.

Make the night moonless so that I might practise my beloved witchcraft undisturbed.

I humbly invoke you, night-wanderer of the underworld, Queen of the dead.

Mother of darkness, give me wisdom. Give me strength.

I am your humble servant. I receive your power, your balanced wisdom,

intelligence and mercy.

Your inner beauty, your sense of justice, the victory of the spirit over matter.

Send me your dreams, visions, astral travels, apparitions,

I will be quiet as a reliable channel for your spiritual wisdom.

I embrace your gifts. I embrace your past and future of victory.

I accept you as my Goddess.

I am your humble servant.

As when men arm themselves for the battle,

then the Goddess is at hand to give victory.

Good is she also when men contend at the games,

for there too the goddess is with them and profits them:

And she is good to stand by horsemen,

and to those whose business is in the grey sea,

and who pray to Hecate and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker,

easily the glorious Goddess gives great catch,

and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will.
