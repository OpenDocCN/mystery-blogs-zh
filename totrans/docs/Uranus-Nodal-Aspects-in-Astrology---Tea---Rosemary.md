## Uranus in General

Uranus is one of the most misunderstood planets in astrology due to its dynamic nature. It doesn’t mean *one thing* the way that the other planets do, instead it has a vast interpretation ability and may mean something different for every person. 

Uranus is essentially “Expect the Unexpected.” Personifying this in a birth chart can be difficult because the question becomes: “what is unexpected about us?”

Typically, Uranus can be understood as the area of life that we want to rebel in. This may come as just being *different* from our peers in some way. It may also indicate something *misunderstood *about us– people from the outside simply don’t understand why we are this way. 

Uranus rules the sign Aquarius, so we can think about it in terms of some Aquarian energy as well. These differences may come in the form of brilliance, inventions, science, technology, sudden changes, freedom, independence, or originality. You’ll notice many of these are keywords we use to describe Aquarius as well. 

Uranus butts against the rules: its position in the natal chart shows us *where we play by our own rules* or refuse to defer to authority. This authority does not necessarily mean above us– it could be society as a whole or expectations of us. 

## North/South Node in General

North and South nodes represent *where we are going*, and *where we are coming from. *

The North Node is the thing we are trying to learn in this life to become the best version of ourselves. It is what our soul wants to incorporate into our personality to have ultimate soul growth. 

The North Node may take us out of our comfort zones at times, and may give us “imposter syndrome” until we learn to incorporate it into ourselves. 

The south node *is our comfort zone*. It’s who we were in a past life, the patterns we are stuck in, and the things that we need to shed in order to fully move forward. 

## Uranus and Nodal Aspects

When Uranus and the Nodes interact (remember Uranus cannot aspect with one Node without also aspecting another), we look at where our rebellions against society help us, hurt us, or hinder our growth. 

Rebelling against society could be what you are meant to do in this life, or it could be a blockage to your greatest fulfillment. These aspects help us see where we can grow and learn, and how Uranus may be affecting our life’s purpose. 

## Uranus Conjunct North Node (Opposition South Node)

With Uranus conjunct North Node in the natal chart, Uranus becomes much more important to the persons life path than it would have been otherwise. In fact Uranus *is *your life path– being different and rebelling from the norm is the thing that you are supposed to do in this life. 

At a young age, you may feel constricted or constrained by your situation, and by society. Many Uranus Conjunct North Node individuals grow up in very traditional households, where morals are imposed on them by some kind of authority. This innately feels wrong to the Uranus Conjunct North Node individual: they would rather figure out their own morals and go their own way in life, but this is not always allowed. 

They develop this craving for independence and freedom early on– and really want to step out into the world and make their mark. However, with Uranus Conjunct North Node, they may be a bit nervous about this– like going against the norms is very out of their comfort zone.

Because Uranus Conjunct North Node means that it you also have Uranus Opposition South Node, your comfort zone is to fit in, to go with what your family and background tells you as right, and not to make any waves. **This is not your life path.**

When Uranus Conjunct North Node people are most aligned to their higher selves, they will find themselves enthralled and fascinated by new and progressive technologies. They may be drawn to non-traditional ways of living, or anything that brings them freedom they so desperately crave. 

Uranus is also the planet of interests and genius, so Uranus Conjunct North Node people find that they work best when they are inspired and interested in the work they are doing. They move quickly and radically, though it may be too radically or the world around them.

It’s important that Uranus Conjunct North Node people take a step back and reflect so they don’t miss steps by wanting to jump ahead. This sense of urgency can be detrimental to them in the long run.

Uranus Conjunct North Node people may be a bit erratic or work too inconsistently. They get an idea, and may be up all night trying to figure out how it would work. They are a true visionary, reformist, or even a revolutionary if they go that far– and Uranus Conjunct North Node people can *easily* go that far. 

Uranus Conjunct North Node people have grand ideas– not just about themselves but about the world around them. Friends tend to gravitate towards them early in life, but they may find themselves losing or outcasting people as they get closer and closer to their ultimate goals. People simply cannot understand how their minds work, or why they would want to make such abrasive changes to the world. 

Unfortunately, this is all part of the journey. This freedom that Uranus Conjunct North Node people crave does push others away, but the soul is on a grand quest for individuality, freedom, and rebellion. This naturally leads to clashes between them and other people. 

As the Uranus Conjunct North Node person progresses in life, they find it harder and harder to fit in. They are less likely to conform for any reason, and feel that the truth is the best they can do– even if others don’t appreciate their truth. These people may even lose touch with reality, or become nervous and sensitive to others opinions of them. 

They need to remember that because this is also Uranus Opposite South Node, their comfort zone is always going to tell them to conform. With Uranus Opposite South Node, they really *want* people to like them– they want to be accepted by their family and society, but something about it feels wrong. 

It is really important that the Uranus Opposite South Node person learns early in life that the key to happiness and to fulfill their life’s purpose is not to live in a societal box, but to break out of it and explore the world for themselves. People who are aligned with your vision will come, and those that are not aligned are best kept away anyways.

You are meant to find a calling that shakes your soul, changes you radically, and *makes you better*. You cannot do this when you are constantly worried about what others think. 

## Uranus Trine North Node (Sextile South Node)

With Uranus Trine North Node, your soul is asking politely for you to be more daring, innovative, and progressive in your way of thinking. Unlike Uranus Conjunct North Node, this is not your entire life path, but it would be beneficial to get you where you need to go. 

Uranus Trine North Node people have progressive energy towards their life path when they are breaking out of the norm. By individuating, and becoming the true and authentic version of themselves, they are spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and physically aligning themselves with their life path so that they may become the best version of themself. 

Uranus Trine North Node is a softer aspect: it is not as harsh as some of the other aspects, so this is *supportive* energy, rather than forceful. These people are simply encouraged to be more daring, take advantage of the changes that happen in life, and become original, inventive, and creative. 

It may feel more natural to follow a traditional life path, or these people may have grown up in a very traditional household. They will find that through creating their own philosophy in life and choosing the path that best suits them regardless of others’ opinions, they will be much closer to their goals. 

These Uranus Trine North Node people have the ability to break new ground on the world, to help with new science and technologies, or philosophies that could change the course of humankind. If they feel particularly compelled to involve themselves in these kinds of things, they could make great strides. 

Uranus Trine North Node people tend to benefit from changes in life, and should ride with the ebbs and flows of life. Changes tend to be good for Uranus Trine North Node people, as long as they don’t get in their own way. 

Because these people also have Uranus Sextile South Node, they may feel a degree of stress or anxiety when going at life on their own. They could easily slip into wanting people to like them, and if they paid too much attention to this, this would grow. 

Or, they could use this Uranus energy *the wrong way*, and get overly involved in a cause that does not feel right for them. Because Uranus Sextile South Node is also a supportive aspect, these people need to be careful of where they put this energy. If they put the energy towards a cause that does not feel right, but *seems* right on the surface, they could be doing more harm than good. 

It is important for Uranus Sextile South Node people to use discernment in how they butt against society, and what causes are good for them. They can easily become a revolutionary *in a bad way* if they get sucked into the wrong thing. 

However, with the correct discernment and using this energy for good, they can make huge strides in the world and be the change they wish to see. 

## Uranus Sextile North Node (Trine South Node)

People with Uranus Sextile North Node are very open-minded naturally, and tend to have very strong identities. This is because Uranus is Trine South Node, so they have already developed a sense of identity from a past life, and have a very strong knowing of who they are. 

Uranus Sextile North Node people think creatively and out of the box naturally– it is not something they have to fight to do. They are natural individuals, and may think of their individuality as one of the most predominant factors in their personality. 

These Uranus Sextile North Node people have the energy to support their career or drive in life, and may use your individuality to propel you into a career that supports your specific life goals. This is not necessarily science or technology related, it may be related to parenting, romance, business, or any other goal in life. 

Uranus Sextile North Node people have noticeable talents, and many people see them as some sort of creative geniuses. This aspect can also indicate extreme and natural intelligence. These people entered life with knowledge that others simply don’t have, and it could have been difficult for them early on in life to fit in because of this. 

Some people are not ready for the Uranus Sextile North Node (Uranus Trine South Node) person’s ideas– they may be a bit too out there. Other times, the Uranus Trine South Node person has a desire or tendency to break out of the norm and confinement in any way they know how. This could lead to all kinds of rebellion issues, and this person does not like being told what to do.

Or, because Sextiles are very supportive energy, the Uranus Sextile North Node person could become a bit lazy in their life and not have a lot of energy to do anything. They may be stuck too far into their comfort zones, and not have the energy to get out of it. 

This is something the Uranus Sextile North Node person should be wary of. In the positives, this aspect creates incredible talents that *are meant to be used, *in the negative, it may make life *too easy* so the person never has to use them. 

## Uranus Opposition North Node (Conjunct South Node)

People with Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) are naturally talented and different than others around them, and may have issues fitting in during childhood. They are a bit of creative geniuses, and have their own methods to life. 

Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) people have a very strong sense of identity, stemming usually from childhood. Something about their childhood experience was *different* from other people’s: there may have been some kind of constant changes. 

The family of the Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) person may have had some kind of separation, or issues that led to them feeling like their childhood home was not necessarily safe. It was a constantly changing environment, and these people had to be very strong in their own identities in order to survive it. 

The Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) person may have gone to gadgets or scientific hobbies, or even electronic devices to get them out of this situation. 

In adulthood, the Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) person likes their home to be the hub of their friend group. They like to be the center of attention, and find themselves feeling the best when they are surrounded by people or a group. 

These people often struggle with nervousness and apprehension when it comes to career. It can be very difficult for them to translate this strong sense of identity from childhood into something concrete that they can use out in the world. 

With Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node), there may be a tendency to rebel for no reason. This can drive people away, because they do not always understand why the Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) person behaves and acts the way that they do. The Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) person tends to feel trapped or boxed in, and feels like they need to break out of that. 

The Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) person has sudden bursts of energy and creativity. They may even be an advocate for change or revolutionary circumstances, especially when major life events happen that propel them in this direction. However, this is not really their life path– their life path is to try to find some solace in society and in friendships. 

Being different and an individual is this Uranus Opposite North Node (Conjunct South Node) person’s comfort zone. They should try to find parts of society that identify with them, and surround themselves with a tribe of people that best fit who they are and want to become.

Ostracizing themselves from society is not their path, and they should be wary of their tendency to rebel for no reason, because it can be a bit jarring to those around them.  

## Uranus Square North/South Node

Uranus Square North Node and South Node people tend to *always *rebel against authority, and are unable to conform to any routines, either professional or domestic.  These people have a *need for change*— and often its to their own detriment. They may rebel or break out of the norm just for the sake of it, not because it feels right or is anything they should do. 

Uranus Square North Node and South Node people tend to change residences or jobs often, or even quit jobs for no reason. The boredom that runs deep in these people tends to propel them into unstable lifestyles, and stability may be the root cause of the boredom. 

Uranus Square North Node and South Node people have little patience for responsibility. Family emotions and responsibilities tie them down, and this energy makes them feel belittled. Often, Uranus Square North Node and South Node will have families, but will use a job to escape them periodically so that they don’t feel so boxed in by them. 

In astrology, where squares exist to the nodes, these are considered lessons that we skipped in a past life. This means that for Uranus Square North Node and South Node people, they completely skipped the lesson of trying to fit in or create something solid, and now it will be extra difficult for them to do. This is a pattern that they picked up in a past life, and may spend the first half of this life trying to overcome (or even more). 

When the Uranus Square North Node and South Node person feels a need to escape, rebel, or flee, they should look internally at what responsibility or boredom is causing the problem, and what fear lies behind that feeling. At the end of the day, they are likely afraid of commitment or of doing something wrong, and this is causing this behavior. Instead of getting stuck in another karmic cycle with even worse results, the Uranus Square North Node and South Node person should try to work on this problem. 

However, Uranus Square North Node and South Node people have a lot of amazing qualities because of this aspect as well. They have brilliance and genius, typically without any kind of formal education. Because they are constantly on their feet, they are constantly learning new things that hopefully they can apply to life. 

These people typically do not have formal education in their field, and are likely *life taught*. However, they do always want to be learning something new, and may be constantly trying to expand their knowledge in their desired field, even if it is contrary to what people *usually do*. 

Uranus Square North Node and South Node people are constantly coming up with unusual ideas and methods, and tend to think differently than other people. Often, their solutions to things are workable and they will put a lot of energy into them.

These are very colorful people that attract others easily, and may find that others rely on them. Uranus Square North Node and South Node people often have houses that others stay in when they are in need of a home, or they have many people wanting to be their friends. This is their soul, and the universe teaching them lessons about responsibility and sticking around for people.

They need to find a way to be an individual without bailing, rebelling for no reason, or constantly being on their feet. There can be stability and genius together– the Uranus Square North Node and South Node person just needs to look internally and figure out what that looks like for them. 

Any overly erratic energy will hold the Uranus Square North Node and South Node person back: they will not be able to achieve all of their goals without stability. They should also work to develop a more tolerant worldview, and not see the world as such a jarring place. 

Because the Uranus Square North Node and South Nodehas a very black and white perspective of the world, they could become a bit of a revolutionary– but this is not in their best interest. They do not have to be an extremist or a rebel just because they feel they are the only ones to play the part. This is the time to try to mediate between living by your own rules, and coexisting in society.
