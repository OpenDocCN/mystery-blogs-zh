Connect with the rain. You must become one with the rain. Combine your energies. Feel the storm pulsing through you. You don't need to be standing in the rain nor does it need to be raining but it should be either about to rain or already raining for it to work.

Chant as many time as you feel is necessary:

I just tried this spell waiting to see what is gonna happen.

Weather spells are kind of a grey area, if they work it takes a lot of energy/focus and you would be moving weather patterns. You also need to think about your area. Say you cast this in Canada, its winter, so it might cause snow [translation: if you're the reason for the freezing rain you better make it stop] that said I doubt this spell works because of how it's written it comes across as fake to me.
