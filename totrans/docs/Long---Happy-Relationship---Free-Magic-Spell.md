**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Altar

*   Cyclamen plant

*   Red candle

*   Purple candle

*   White candle

 This spell does not "force" the bond, but rather magnifies each of your good qualities so that the other can see them more easily. Once everything good about you is magnified, the other person naturally grows more and more fond of you.

First, of course, prepare your external sacred space, and cast your magick circle around your altar. On a Friday during the third hour of darkness: Place a potted cyclamen in the room, and water the plant. Light three candles: deep red, purple, and white. Say aloud:

> "I ask the goddess Branwen to bestow true love on my union with (insert name)."

> Breathe your love into your heart. Place the red candle in front of the other candles.
> 
> > "I ask that this be done for the greater good/ so be it. And so it is."
> 
> Gaze at the flames in each candle, and when you are ready, blow them out. Remember that it is important for you to be grounded in the basics of Magick and Witchcraft before you attempt any serious Love magicks. Because desire and emotion are tied so strongly to love, the spells can have some unpredictable results if you haven't practiced the basic secrets of real witchcraft.
