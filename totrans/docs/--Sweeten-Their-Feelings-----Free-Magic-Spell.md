Fill the jar ¼ of the way with honey.

Fill the jar the rest of the way with honey, intermittently scattering rose petals or rose oil in. Scatter glitter in for the aesthetic.

Cork or close the jar.

Take the tea light out of the metal tin if it has one and place the candle onto the lid of the jar.

Light the candle and while it burns, visualize the person and your feelings towards them.

Let the wax melt over the lid, sealing it. Blow out the candle once the wax has sealed the lid shut.

Burn the candle whenever you want their thoughts to turn to you.
