 This is a hedge witchcraft method of easing a headache or body aches. I use this when I find pain reliever to be lacking.

​​​​​​​Healing Stones of the Hedge:

Place the quartz stones on the top of the oil warmer, I've seen these in general department stores such as Walmart. 

Within the opening in the oil warmer, place the tea- light candle after lighting it. Let the quartz stones warm for a while. When you feel enough time has passed, transfer the stones safely with a pair of tongs from the warmer to the cloth. You want the stones contained within the cloth and not used or placed directly on the skin. Hold the warm cloth containing the quartz on areas which are painful. This is a useful method for migraines, muscle aches, or cramps.

When the cloth and stones begin cooling, again carefully place the quartz stones in the warmer dish to continue to be warmed.

If you are experiencing pain due to a medical emergency, **always seek an emergency room and doctor.**

This is never recommended for broken limbs.
