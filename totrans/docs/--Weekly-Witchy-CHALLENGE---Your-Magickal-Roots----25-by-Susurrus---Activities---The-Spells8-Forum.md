[@christina4](/u/christina4) that is beautiful! I am so happy that you have so much love! I understand being a single mama with a void that needs to be filled. I have had that too. I‚Äôm going through something right now that requires self love & I‚Äôm learning to listen to myself first. I love my kids with my everything & would lay down my life to save them. I think any parent would feel that way but I would rather have the time with them now.

I consider your family as well, otherwise, I wouldn‚Äôt share as much about me as I do. I learn so much from each one of you & how everyone‚Äôs path is different. I‚Äôm learning to make it my own in my own way. I hope you reach the love you are looking for, it‚Äôs there. It will show itself when the time is right.
