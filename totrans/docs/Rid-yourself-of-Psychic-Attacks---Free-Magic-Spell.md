 Place the candles at the back of the altar, one on the right to represent the God, one on the left for the Goddess. Place the salt water in the centre, and the incense at the front.

Anoint each item with the oil and say :

> **"I ward off negativity in my home, work and everyday life.
> No evil or negativity shall enter here."**

Picture a white light around you and as it increases to full intensity, picture it surrounding your home and work place Now say :

> **"Psychic vampires in the night
> Psychic vampires who destroy my life
> Destroy no more of what I achieve
> Destroy no more of what I receive
> Negativity is not welcome
> Evil is not welcome
> In me, around me or the people I love."**

Repeat this 3 times, then allow the incense and candles to burn themselves out.
