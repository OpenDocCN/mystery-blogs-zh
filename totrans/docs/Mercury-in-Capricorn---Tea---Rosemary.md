Mercury is the planet that rules the mind, thought processes, and communication style in Astrology.  It tells us not what we think about, but how we think. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, and moves the fastest. It may be difficult to differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is the persona, and Mercury is the mind. 

## Mercury in Capricorn: The Saturn Mind

Mercury in Capricorn people are strategic and analytical,  but their minds leave little room for excitement and play. They cut out all the fluff, and want to just focus on the most important things. 

Their mind works slower than other Mercury signs. Mercury in Capricorn is always weighing the pros and cons, and making judgments about things. They likely have a schedule that they stick to very closely.

Mercury in Capricorn is like the Tortoise in the “Tortoise and the Hare.” For them, slow and steady wins the race. It may take them a long time to make a decision or plan, but when Mercury in Capricorn makes a decision, be assured that it will be the *right* decision.  

For Mercury in Capricorn people, there is only **one** way to do things: the right way. The right way is defined however their mind has decided to define it. They are not one to take orders, and very much like to be the one in charge. This may cause some clashes with other Mercury in Capricorn folks who have decided that the *right *way is different. 

The Mercury in Capricorn brain very much enjoys tradition. This goes beyond mere family traditions, and actually spills into what I call “the traditions of the mind.” If a Mercury in Capricorn has always done something one way, no matter how unsuccessful or roundabout that way may be, they will continue to follow the same path. 

### Structure

The Mercury in Capricorn brain is structured and judgmental. It is not that Mercury in Capricorn people are *trying* to be judgmental, rather it is just the way their brains work. They **must** judge something in order to perceive it. 

The Mercury in Capricorn brain is very black and white. Things are either right or wrong, and there is no grey area. These people pride themselves on being very moral and upstanding. They leave little room for error in themselves and others. 

One of my Mercury in Capricorn clients leaves no room for error in her roommates. If someone uses a dish, it must get cleaned right away. If they leave food out, she will send them pictures of their mistake and ask them to fix it as soon as possible. 

The Mercury in Capricorn brain thrives off of its own structure. They do not like chaos or messes, and feel compelled to clean something up when it falls into disarray. This may cause some strife between Mercury in Capricorn and some of the mutable Mercury signs, like Mercury in Pisces or Mercury in Gemini. 

When Mercury in Capricorn is afflicted, this can create a person who *wants* to be able to organize things, but struggles because of ADHD or some other neurodivergency. 

## Mercury in Capricorn and Communication

People with Mercury in Capricorn are very attentive listeners. They listen with all of their attention, and pride themselves on being able to be helpful with their comments and insights.

It may take a Mercury in Capricorn person slightly longer to offer their insight, as their brain works more “slow and steady” than other brains, but when they do, they will make sure their advice was correct. 

Mercury in Capricorn people are *authority figures* to everyone around them. When you first meet a Mercury in Capricorn person, you will have an inherent need to impress them. These people have a very strong presence, and their discerning nature makes them especially hard to impress. 

Mercury in Capricorn people will pick up on all the minute details of your personality, but they will only focus on the things that *matter* when they decide to judge you. For most Mercury in Capricorn people, the things that matter involve respect, manners, and kindness. They do not care about frill or niceties. 

In a group of people, Mercury in Capricorn is the one in charge. They decide where you are going, when you are getting there, and who you are meeting there. This person does not bend to the authority or will of others, so if you want them around, its better to let them decide. 

They are independent by nature. This means that if the group decides they do not want to do what Mercury in Capricorn suggested, the Mercury in Capricorn person will still do what they want, just by themselves.

### Passive Aggressive

When Mercury in Capricorn decides that someone did something that was *not correct*, they will likely respond accordingly. Usually, Mercury in Capricorn will not get outright angry, but rather they will be passive aggressive and let you know that they judged your actions as wrong. 

They may do some small or nit-picky things to undermine you, and if you directly ask them why, they will likely relate it back to what you did to cause it. When Mercury in Capricorn people behave this way, it almost feels like you are a child being put in “time-out.”

Mercury in Capricorn people are very intelligent and capable. They do not take revenge lightly, and want others to “submit” to their will. This makes them particularly difficult to get along with as peers.

As parents, they will walk the line between domineering and controlling, and moral and upstanding. They want their children to make the right decisions, but they get to narrowly tailor what “right” is, based on their own experiences.

For example, one of my clients is in an all-out war with her 19 year old son over tattoos. She absolutely refuses to accept that he wants them, because she made her mind up a long time ago and has already decided that they are “wrong.” This kind of disapproval, and looking down your nose at people, does not always come off well in close and personal relationships. 

## Mercury in Capricorn Woman

The Mercury in Capricorn woman is a force to be reckoned with. I would not mess with this woman if I were you. She picks up everything from her surroundings, stores the information in her brain, and uses it against people right when they least expect it. 

The Mercury in Capricorn woman will *make* you wrong, even if you weren’t. She is a master manipulator and can turn any situation in her favor. She has the memory of an elephant, and can recall the moment five years ago that you said something contradictory to what you are saying now.

This woman is an authority figure to everyone in her life. People may joke and call her “the boss,” and this is likely the role that the Mercury in Capricorn woman plays in the lives of those around her. 

She is too intelligent for her own good. When she meets new people, she sizes them up using her judgment and discernment, and quickly decides if they are worth her time and energy, or not. However, once she develops a soft spot for someone, that does not go away easily. She is fiercely loyal to those that she holds in high esteem.

## Mercury in Capricorn Man

The Mercury in Capricorn man is easier to be around than his female counterpart. He is less domineering and controlling, and more independent in his actions. He cares less about telling other people what to do and how to do it, and more about making sure his own actions are done the correct way. 

The Mercury in Capricorn man is quick-witted and helpful. He speaks with confidence, and really “talks the talk.” This man comes off like a professional regardless of what field he is in. 

This man is clear and concise. In a fight, he will do less to manipulate and control than his female counterpart, but his opinion is unbending. The Mercury in Capricorn man will talk down to you until you feel so ashamed at your emotions and feelings, that you concede. He is more of a strong-arm type fighter than a manipulator. 

He is very responsible for his age, and probably comes off as mature beyond his years. He takes life very seriously. The Mercury in Capricorn man is not someone to be messed with, as he will always do the right thing, even if that means punching you in the face.
