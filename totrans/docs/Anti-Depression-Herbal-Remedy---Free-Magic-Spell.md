*   Gray Cloth Bag

*   Agate (Optional but highly recommended)

*   Ability to Manipulate Energy. (Optional)

 The process of making this herbal anti depressant is fairly easy.

First grab the gray cloth bag. It must be gray because the color gray helps with loneliness. Next, add the dried Dandelion. Dandelion is used in healing rituals that are focused on depression. After that, add the Honeysuckle. Honeysuckle is known for helping with willpower. This can help battle the depression. Lastly, add the dried Lavender and the aromatherapy oil. To put the oil in the bag, place around 5 drops onto a piece of tissue. Lavender is commonly known for its relaxation properties, which can help calm the persons mind. Using agate is optional, but it is definitely beneficial. Agate has properties of relieving sadness, helping with mental health / depression, healing, and more energy. I highly recommend using it. Once you put all the ingredients into the bag, then you are set.

If you are giving this bag to someone, then you can also put positive energy into the cloth bag. To start with this, you will need to center yourself.

*   Go to a place where no one can disturb you
*   Regulate your breathing until it is even / Meditate
*   Visualize your energy while rubbing your hands together
*   Move them a couple inches apart. You should feel a tingling sensation on your hands.

Once you can feel the energy that you have took from within you, you can then shape it into a ball. Think happy thoughts and determination as you are forming this energy. Then slowly push it into the gray cloth bag. Now you're done!

Remember, you are not making new energy. Energy can not be created or destroyed. You are either borrowing it from your surroundings or yourself.

Herbs can be very helpful in treating mental illness from my experience, and I think this seems like a spell that could work and help people. However, if one is suffering from clinical depression or another mood disorder, they should seek professional treatment in addition to magick, rather than relying completely on spells.
