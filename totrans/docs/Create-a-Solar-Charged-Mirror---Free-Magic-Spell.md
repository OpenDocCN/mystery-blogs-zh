# Create a Solar Charged Mirror

Any mirror may be converted into a magic mirror; in sense every mirror is a magic mirror.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Create a Solar Charged Mirror'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** On a bright, sunny day, hold a small mirror in the palm of your hand, tilted to catch direct the sunlight. Maintain this position for no more than a few seconds. Nine seconds is the maximum. That's it and the mirror is charged. The sun is so powerful that nine seconds is all it takes, and half of that is probably more than sufficient.

This mirror must be reserved for magical purposes. If it's accidentally used for another purpose, it must be cleansed, reconsecrated, and the ritual repeated. If done incorrectly, it can have tragic consequences.
