 First mediate at designated time, cleansing your heart chakra with rose quartz.

Have red, white, and pink candles lit on full moon.

With warm or hot water, mix in a tablespoon of rose water, strawberry extract, and pink salt.

Then put lipstick on and summon God Eros and Goddess Aphrodite.

Write the full name of your lover and his zodiac sign and clip it with his picture.

Put 3 drops of your blood on a rose petal, ( AS YOU PICK THE ROSE PETALS UP AND SAY THE SPELL, DROP IT IN THE POTION) pick up one and say, **This rose petal represents thy soul of mine. **Pick up another and say, **This represents thy soul of my dearest love, (Lovers name). **GENTLY, pick up the rose petal with the 3 drops of blood on it and say, **This represents thy unconditional love of mine for my dearest love, (Lovers name).** You should’ve dropped all of the petals in the potion.

Kiss the picture of your lover and place that and the paper with his name and sign in your dream bag and put in under your pillow. Then chant 5 times:

**(Lover’s full name), I know you love me, **

**please don’t hide it, **

**Let me open up your heart with thy key,**

**so that you may show it.**

Drink half of the potion then chant 5 times:

**Lord and Lordess of love, Eros and Aphrodite,**

**Let (Lovers name) love me with all his heart.**

**So mote it be, so shall it be.**

Drink the rest of the potion.

Let me know how it worked!
