Wouldnt you die if you had a whole cup of your own blood

You wouldn't die, but you certainly would not be feeling brilliant. I cannot say enough that this kind of spell that calls for blood, especially in this quantity is not recommended and can be exceptionally unsafe and potentially harmful for you and anyone around.

I doubt this works. For your own safety, should you desire to curse someone, pick a different spell instead of testing this one.
