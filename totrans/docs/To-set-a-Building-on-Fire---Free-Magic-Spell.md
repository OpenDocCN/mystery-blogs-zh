Name says it all.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'To set a Building on Fire'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

Nothing

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

Nothing

 Inscribe the rune for Âdisruption due to outside forcesÂ or draw another symbol for that or you could draw the place on fire and spirits surrounding it. In 2 other pieces of paper write the name of the place/building you want to set on fire.

* Cast a protection spell on yourself, and your homeÂjust in case. Also, if you cast circles and invite the guardians and elements, just ask them to protect you.

Breathe, Meditate on what it is youÂd like. See the building on fire, feel the intense heat, see everything on fire, see smoke, hear things blowing, burning, and people screaming. Do that for 10-15 minutes. Another alternative to that is imagine everything I just told you but imagine spirits igniting the flames. If you find it hard to imagine that just try to sense it. After that Chant in a commanding voice for like 5 minutes while holding the picture of the fire:

ÂSpirits that destroy by flames,
I summon you to do the sameÂ

After that, throw in the first paper with the name of the place.

Recite for 5 minutes while holding the picture.

ÂSpirits that destroy by flames,
I summon you to do the sameÂ.

Throw in the second.

Repeat the chant for 5 minutes again.

Then throw in the paper with the picture of the building, but before you do kiss it. ÂKiss of deathÂ watch it burn. Thank the spirits if youÂd like and let the flames begin. If youÂd like you can repeat this spell for 3 nights. I doubt you will, its took a long time.
