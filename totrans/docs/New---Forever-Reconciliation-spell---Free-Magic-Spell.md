is this white or black magic?

That depends on how you define the term, which varies quite broadly depending on traditions followed and personal opinion. Some hold that white magic is anything desiring a positive ends, and anything desiring harm to the target would be considered black magic. Some hold that manipulating free will falls under black magic. Some believe doing any sort of magic regarding another person without their direct knowledge and consent is black magic. Some traditions hold strictly that only workings focused on the inner self are so-called white magic, while anything desiring an external result should be avoided. Some further their insistence by explaining any desired external positive effects will come by internal progress and betterment as a person.

To add to prsona's comment, Magik is intention, not colour. Some witches categorize spells by colour, but Magik is neutral and it is the spellcaster that gives the positive or negative charge. I highly recommend you create a code of ethics before casting spells. Unless you follow a religion such as Wicca, a lot of The Craft is personal. As yourself what is and is not morally justified in your opinion. Once you have a code of ethics, it will be easier for you to determine what spells you feel you should and should not cast. In Wicca, we have The Rede, which states harm none. On paper, great, in practice, not so much. Hitting someone is harmful, and most people would agree it is wrong. What about in self defense? How about gossiping or name calling? The person is physically fine, but are hurt mentally and emotionally. Once you you understand what mundane issues you feel are right and wrong, think about Magikally. Reading over this spell, you are saying you are ready to make amends, but the other person is not involved, therefore you are making a choice for them to get back together. Would you consider this right or wrong based on your morals? That is your answer.
