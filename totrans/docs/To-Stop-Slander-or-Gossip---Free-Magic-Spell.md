Write on a piece of paper that is 3 inches x 3 inches, the word "Rumors" and the rumors that are being spread about you. Do not write the names of those who are slandering you! You do not want to harm them and suffer the consequences with karma! Be thinking of these lies going away never to return as you draw an X with a dark marker across the paper. Toss the paper into the fire and repeat the following words 3 times.

"Rumors, slander standing stout,
with this X, I cross you out
I toss their words into the fire,
all these lies no longer hire
All bad things done and said,
leave my life, be gone be dead!
All the evil that they say,
make it all go away!
Rumors carry me no more,
be gone be dead, be no more!"

Sit and concentrate on all the bad gossip going away for a few minutes, then extinguish the fire!

I can see this working well enough, however sometimes you need to stop the source, so I would either bind the people speaking ill of you, or consider including them in some type of karma spell.

sounds like a very effective spell, thanks for sharing

I see so its to stop rumors but if what they're saying is true and they're trying to use it against you, it'll work the same right?

It's meant to put an end to people talking about you in general. If you want a rumour to stop going around [factual or not] a stop gossip spell can help.
