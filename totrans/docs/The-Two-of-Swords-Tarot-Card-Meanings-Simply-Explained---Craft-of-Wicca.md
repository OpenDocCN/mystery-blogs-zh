## The Two of Swords tarot card description

The Two of Swords is a tarot card in the suit of Swords, associated with thoughts, ideas, and communication.

 This card typically features an image of a person blindfolded, holding two swords crossed over their chest. The person is often standing on the edge of a body of water, which may symbolize the emotions, unconscious thoughts, or intuition that are being suppressed or guarded against.

 The blindfold on the person represents being emotionally or intellectually blocked, or unable to see the situation clearly.

 The two swords crossing over the chest symbolize a decision that must be made or a choice between two conflicting paths. The person’s stance, with one foot on land and one in water, represents the balance between logic and emotions, and the need to find a way to reconcile the two.

In some depictions of the Two of Swords, the full moon may be visible in the background, symbolizing a time of introspection and heightened emotions.

 The card may also feature an intricate design or pattern on the hilt of the swords, further emphasizing the need for careful consideration and attention to detail in decision-making.

 In a tarot reading, the Two of Swords suggests being at a crossroads and making a difficult decision, often related to a choice between emotions and logic. The card may also indicate a need for balance or a period of inner conflict and uncertainty.
