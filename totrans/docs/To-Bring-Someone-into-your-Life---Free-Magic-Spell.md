 Assign one article as the feminine person and one as masculine. Take the piece of pink ribbon, and tie the female object to one end and the male to the  other, leaving a good length of ribbon  between them. 

Every morning untie the ribbon, move the objects a little closer together, and retie the - knots. Eventually the objects will touch. Leave them bound together for seven days before untying them.
