 ## Casting Instructions for 'Stitched Lips Gossip Spell'

*   White candle

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A square piece of white cloth, around 4 inches across

*   Markers or paint

*   Heavy black thread

*   Sewing needle

*   White candle

Turn off the lights and light the candle. You need to do this spell by candlelight only. Use a marker to draw a face on the cloth. Try to make it somewhat resemble the person but you don't have to be an artist. Write their name under the face.

Then use the thread to stitch over the drawn mouth. You don't have to actually cut it to make a hole, just stitch through the fabric along the line you drew for the mouth. While you sew, say these words:

Mouth be closed, do not speak
No more trouble will you wreak
When sweeter words become your way
Then you can have your say

Feel free to snuff out the candle when you are done sewing, but leave the sewn face out where you can see it each day until you feel the gossiping has stopped. The intention of this spell is to be directed at one person, but you could do a more general one with no name to help keep gossip away.
