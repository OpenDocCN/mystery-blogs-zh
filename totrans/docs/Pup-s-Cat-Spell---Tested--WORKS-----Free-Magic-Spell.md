You cannot turn into a cat.

You cannot physically transform into a cat.

Does it work

As stated above, this doesn't work. Magick is a natural force and on the physical, it doesn't contradict nature. You could look into meditations to connect with cat spirits/energies, you could also mentally or astrally shift into a cat, but physically you can't shapeshift.

Question. Why make a spell of this?
