## Casting Instructions for 'Incubus Formal Invitation'

PLEASE READ!!!

This spell/ritual [Incubus Formal Invitation] can't be modified as it's a this spell/ritual was given to me by Princess Saaraji Lilith.
Princess Saaraji Lilith is the daughter of Lilith and Saaraji is also a priestess. Who is Saaraji to me? she is my supernatural guide and supernatural wife.

This spell/ritual [Incubus Formal Invitation] can't be modified but if you want to it's up to you but I don't recommend it especially if you are serious about inviting an incubus.

Incubus is an supernatural entity some people believes they are male demon that appears in dreams, who takes the form of a human man in order to have sexual intercourse. The female counterpart is the Succubus.

Succubus/Incubus are supernatural entity or you can say supernatural being like human being and they are like human they have freewill and can be good or evil, like human they are asexual, bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual but the truth is most succubus/incubus are heterosexual very few are asexual don't feel bad there's many bisexual and homosexual.

In some religious traditions hold that repeated intercourse with a incubus may result in the deterioration of health or even death. From my personal experience with Saaraji I have to say that I am 31 years old a very health and happy and I believe every human will taste death just that some human die young others don't.

This spell/ritual is just to invite a Incubus with a formal Invitation, Incubus usually appears without invite, so why invite? I don't recommend you to invite but if you are trying to summon I can help you.
