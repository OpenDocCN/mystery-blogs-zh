Does this work?

Probably not. Mere words alone does not a spell make. It will take a lot more than just this segment of rhyme to change you. If you are in need of serious change, you will have to put in a lot of work in understand why you are the way you are and how to change yourself.

You will have to record youre voice when you interact with people, take charismas class and try and calm yourself down when youre talking to people if youre talking to loudly or being really hyper excited, you energy is way too high for them their energy might be on a medium or low so be aware of youre social surroundings when youre talking to someone or presenting yourself, first impressions is everything and most importantly take care youre hygiene and clean youre face up this will help greatly.
