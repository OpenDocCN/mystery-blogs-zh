# Hurt someone that Attacks You

  Rated 5/5 Stars

It makes you much stronger against them that you may even fatally injure them. This is NOT a spell of black magic, as you are only defending yourself. I created this spell and it has always worked for me.

it worked i almost paralyzed my bully

We do this on command after we do the spell

Focusing all of your anger and punching someone is not a spell. It would work, you would punch them really, really hard, but it is not a spell. Also, do not punch people. Even if it is a bully. I understand self defense, you are being attacked and need to stop the attacker. Punching someone for revenge is not self defense.
