If you don't want to open a new window or a new tab, just read here:

Ingredients:
-Powdered dragon's blood
-Sea salt
-Frankincense (solid resin/essential oil)
-Myrrh (solid resin/essential oil)
-Castor oil
-Jojoba oil (optional)

Instructions:
1) Blend powdered dragon's blood and sea salt together with a mortar and pestle (or anything you prefer).
2) If you're using solid resins, grind frankincense and myrrh together in the ingredients in Step 1.
3) Add these to the castor oil which has protective capacities of its own. You may wish to add Jojoba oil as a preservative, so that the oil will flow nicely. If you're using essential oils, then add frankincense and myrrh now.

p.s. Some variations may suggest adding ground ginger and cinnamon, you could also add some if you prefer to. Just be aware that these are skin irritants and may limit the uses of the oil. Without these ingredients, Fiery Wall can added to the bath or worn as a protective perfume.
