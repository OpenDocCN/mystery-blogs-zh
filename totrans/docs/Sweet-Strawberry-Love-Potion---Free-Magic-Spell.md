i use to make something similar to this as a little kid [it wasn't a love potion, i just really liked mashing fresh strawberries with sugar and cream to have with tea] i love this spell. it's super cute and easy. big thumbs up from me [though i might switch it from microwave to stove, but that's personal preference]
