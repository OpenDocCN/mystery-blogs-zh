Add these to the castor oil which has protective capacities of its own. You may wish to add Jojoba oil as a preservative, so that the oil will flow nicely. If you're using essential oils, then add frankincense and myrrh now.

Some variations may suggest adding ground ginger and cinnamon, you could also add some if you prefer to. Just be aware that these are skin irritants and may limit the uses of the oil. Without these ingredients, Fiery Wall can added to the bath or worn as a protective perfume.
