For a long time, past life regressions were kind of taboo. It’s only very recently (thanks to TikTok, in part!) that past life regression meditations became popular.

Of course, many people still don’t believe in past lives. Others are unsure. Whether you know past lives are real for certain or you’re just exploring, my hope is that this post will give you some insight into the different methods you can use to do a past life regression.

These methods are accessible and easy for anyone! Go with your gut and try out the past life regression meditation method that feels right.

## 1\. Use The Youtube Guided Session

Brian Weiss is basically the past life master or guru in the spiritual community. He wrote one of the original books on past lives ([Many Lives Many Masters](https://rstyle.me/+_G5vd4CTTvittdzsjWJC6Q)).

He’s a super cool guy; he was a trained psychiatrist who believed only in science and accidentally discovered that past lives exist while hypnotizing a client.

Now, he’s one of the leading past life regressionists. If you want to actually do a past life regression (with your eyes closed by going into a deep meditation) and wish to see your own life, then I recommend using his guided regression on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKtIEk8BDeo).

This video got popular on TikTok, but regardless of PR, it’s  a great regression whether you’re a beginner or advanced.

The video is about 30 minutes long; you’ll want to make sure you have a quiet place where you can relax without interruptions. You’ll also want to make sure you aren’t too tired so you don’t accidentally fall asleep.

Don’t stress too much about the specifics and just give it a try! You may be surprised by how much you discover. [Click here to access the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKtIEk8BDeo).

This past life regression meditation is especially good for anyone who can’t afford a session with a trained professional but doesn’t feel ready to do a self-guided meditation.

## 2\. Use Past Life Oracle Cards

I *love* past life oracle cards. This is a simple way to do a past life reading without even closing your eyes.

My favorite past life oracle cards were created by Doreen Virtue and Brian Weiss, but Doreen Virtue is unfortunately no longer involved in spiritual practices, so these cards are no longer being sold.

They are available on Etsy, and I promise, it’s worth the wait in shipping time. [Check them out here](https://rstyle.me/+e_8XrXhMn2ebKtpAml8b5g). These are the mini cards because they’re the only cards sold right now. Regardless, this is 100% the best past life oracle deck.

The oracle cards tell about different situations, places, people, and life purposes. For example, you could get Authority Figures and Finances one after the other. This would probably mean that you held a position of authority and managed money.

The first few cards will set the stage for your life, but keep pulling cards until you figure out what *happened* in your life. What did you learn from it? Was there one defining thing that still lingers in your unconscious memory? Why is the Universe showing you this life?

You may get some intuitive feelings as your pull cards – assume they’re right! For example, if you feel that the Authority Figures and Finances cards means you worked in a city in finance, you’re probably correct.

You may also get inklings as to the time period, setting, or people that were in your life.

If you have more questions after you’ll pulled a good amount of cards, try using the pendulum to clear them up or confirm your intuition.

This isn’t technically a past life regression meditation, but you can always do a simple meditation after you pull cards to actually see the life described.

## 3\. Use The Pendulum

If you work with the pendulum, dowsing can be a simple way to discover a past life.

You’ll need to make a few of your own charts that pertain specifically to a past life. [Here is a good example of a past life chart](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0a/7e/2c/0a7e2c007d39760b165637b79be6837d.jpg). I recommend drawing your own in any way that feels right.

You’ll want to [get comfortable with your pendulum](https://teaandrosemary.com/pendulum-dowsing-101/) before you attempt to ask specific past life questions. Once you feel ready to do your past life reading, make sure to clear the pendulum beforehand and find a quiet place to work.

You can ask as many questions as needed to flesh out your past life I recommend making at least a few different charts to get details, as well as asking yes and no questions for confirmation.

## 4\. Do A Self-Guided Past Life Regression Meditation

If you feel ready or are naturally pretty strong during mediations, you can attempt a self-guided past life regression meditation.

The process will be similar to the YouTube guided meditation (#1 in this list), but you will be guiding yourself.

You of course don’t need to actually speak the words in your head to guide yourself. You can simply visualize yourself taking the steps to walk through the relaxation period and then your past life.

With this method, it’s easy to get stuck in one potion of your past life. You’ll need to make sure that you continue to ask yourself: “what happens next?” in order to see a full life.

[This is a great script](http://susahypnotherapy.com/pdf/pastliferegression.pdf) that will give you an idea of the direction you need to go in. Because it’s your own past life regression meditation, you can personalize it however you’d like.

## 5\. Book An Appointment With A Regressionist

If you want to start off with a professional or even just want to experience what a full past life regression feels like, search on Google for a past life regressionist in your area.

You’ll want to check reviews in order to find a good regressionist. There are some certifications that these professionals can have, but they don’t generally speak to the quality of the sessions.

These sessions are usually 2-3 hours long and are very involved. If you have trouble meditating, this is a good place to start for a past life regression meditation.

The one caveat is that these sessions are generally very expensive. If you can afford it, then by all means give it a try.

If you’re tight on cash or feel nervous about having someone else experience your personal past life, then try out the YouTube guided meditation at the top of this list.

**Remember, regardless of the method you choose, follow your gut and be open to receiving information in *any* form. Sometimes the Universe will send you messages in ways you don’t expect!**

Alternatively, if none of these methods are working for you but you enjoy studying astrology, try doing [past life astrology](https://teaandrosemary.com/past-life-astrology/) and see if this works better. Past life astrology is so complicated that we wrote a whole other post on it – [check it out here](https://teaandrosemary.com/past-life-astrology/).
