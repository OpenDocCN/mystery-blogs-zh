## Classical Interpretation

The classical meaning of The Empress can be seen in the Rider-Waite deck.

She’s wearing a red robe covered in pomegranates, an ancient symbol of fertility, and she’s sitting on cushions made from scarlet velvet. One cushion features the sign for Venus, the planet of love, creativity etc.

 The Empress is meant to represent all of these qualities.

 The Empress is surrounded by lush trees and a winding stream. This embodies her connection with the Earth and life.

She enjoys nature because it find tranquility in the trees, the water, and life around us. It always make her feel better. The wheat reflects abundance from a recent harvest, and things are looking good for this particular field.

 All these symbol show just how complex this card is and why it has been the cause for much speculation and study over the years.

 ### Upright The Empress Meaning

Here are some interpretations of the upright Empress.

This Empress card holder is perfect for an entrepreneur or ambitious individual who has something to prove. You are surrounded with all the trappings of a prosperous life.

There’s nothing more you could want for. Things are looking good for your company. You’ve reached that point in the business cycle where all your hard work has paid off and now fortune seems to be smiling on you.

 When you see Empress from the Tarot in your readings, remember that abundance surrounds you and is created by you. Reflect on all that has been accomplished and be grateful in order to cultivate even more success.

The meaning is easy to remember by just reading some of the upright card keywords off of the symbols:

*   Pomegranates
*   Abundant wheat
*   Lush, growing forest
*   Wealthy jewelry

The Empress tarot card appears to be able to predict pregnancy or childbirth. This could be the start of a new project, relationship, life change, or actual physical pregnancy. Try to nurture and support your creative ideas; let your creativity seep through to the world and give it compassion and love.

 The classical meaning of the card should be easy to remember.

### Reversed The Empress Meaning

Reversed, The Empress is the opposite. You are not prosperous in business, so prioritize self-care.

 Now is the time to love yourself. Too often, people give away their power by thinking too much about what others need or want to what they themselves want.

 Giving yourself time to refuel often can be hard to find, but it’s important to make time for yourself. This will enable you take care of others without feeling resentful or exhausted.

 The Empress Reversed can mean you are blocked creatively.

 This is especially true for new idea or expressing a “birthed idea.” You worry too much about what others think: will it be a success? Is it appealing?

Stop bothering about the views of others. Allow your creative energy to flow, even if it means keeping things private for a while.

 ## Modern Interpretations

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, and so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation for the moment.

Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

 We’ll use a different deck for every one of these. Today’s is the Light Seer’s Tarot.

 Let’s notice several of the differences. The first major difference is the emphasis on pregnancy. In fact, she is birthing the world–motherly symbolism to the front.

It could mean that you have taken on the whole of humanity. You are dedicating yourself and your life to worldly causes and maybe even activism.

 I like the fish swimming as well. This is a new symbol re-representing the stream in the original. Continue creating and going with the flow. You are on a good path.

 The next major change that jumps out is that she is much more humble. Instead of rich clothing and jewelry, she is of the Earth, with simple stick bracelet and leaves in her hair.

You have the ability to turn your skills into wealth, but you choose to sacrifice worldly possessions in pursuit of more nobler ambitions of saving the world.

 Maybe you do this too much to a fault. You alone cannot save the world, and it may be worth taking some of your creative energy and spending it on yourself.

 ## The Empress in Context

Context matters a lot when reading the cards. Here are some particularly strong things to look out for.

I think the meaning should be clear in the past/present/future positions. It will indicate being new birth, new ideas and life cycles in those parts of your life.

 It should also be easy for physical topics:

 *   Hobbies: you may be taking on a new one
*   Relationships: time to try new things
*   Etc
