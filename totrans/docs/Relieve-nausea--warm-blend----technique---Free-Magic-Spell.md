Dose this work?

Ginger helps with nausea, mint is also good for the stomach, and lavender is soothing. Try it and see if it helps.

Could this work with structure week points ? If I change the chant, I came up with the idea because one of the options of using this spell was pressure points, so I thought maybe I could use this spell with weak points in structures

I don't know much about reflexology, but in theory, you can. However, it depends on what exactly you're doing if it would be considered a spell. Drinking tea is just drinking tea until you focus and direct energy into the moment.
