## The Chariot Reversed: General Meanings

**The Chariot Reversed: Unveiling the Essence**

In its upright form, the Chariot stands as an emblem of triumph, ambition, and determination, signifying an individual who takes charge of their destiny, steering their life towards victory. However, when it appears in reverse, the Chariot takes on a different guise—one that bespeaks a loss of direction, inner conflicts, and struggles. Imagine the horses pulling the Chariot veering off course, leaving the charioteer grappling to regain control.

**Struggling with Purpose**

At the core of the Chariot reversed lies a sense of internal struggle. Uncertainty clouds the vision, and the once-clear path becomes blurred. It can be frustrating to feel torn between divergent goals or desires, unsure of which direction to pursue. In this state, the Chariot reversed reminds us to pause and reflect, for it is in moments of contemplation that we find clarity amidst the chaos.

**A Bumpy Ride: Facing Obstacles**

Life is seldom a smooth ride, and the Chariot reversed is no exception. When this card appears in a reading, it serves as a cautionary sign that obstacles may impede our progress. These barriers could arise in various forms—external challenges, internal doubts, or even unforeseen circumstances that test our resilience. As we navigate these hurdles, the Chariot reversed advises us to remain steadfast and patient, for adversity often paves the way for growth.

**The Ego in Check**

In the reversed Chariot, the charioteer’s ego may take center stage. While ambition can be a powerful driving force, an inflated ego can lead to arrogance and impulsive decision-making. In such moments, it is essential to check our egos and embrace humility. Acknowledging our limitations enables us to learn from mistakes and chart a more balanced course ahead.

**Finding Balance in Dualities**

The Chariot reversed also invites us to *explore the concept of duality*—opposing forces that reside within us. These forces can represent anything from light and shadow aspects of our personality to contrasting life goals and values. Embracing these dualities and finding harmony between them is key to progress. Balancing our desire for control with the willingness to adapt can guide us towards smoother terrain.

**Steering through Emotional Turbulence**

Emotions play a significant role in the Chariot reversed’s narrative. Emotional turbulence may cloud judgment, making it challenging to make rational decisions. Fear, anger, or impatience can hinder us from navigating life’s complexities with grace. Acknowledging and understanding these emotions empowers us to transcend them, like a skillful charioteer who reins in wild horses and guides them towards a harmonious rhythm.

**A Time for Self-Reflection**

When the Chariot appears in reverse, it often calls for a period of introspection. Self-reflection helps us to identify roadblocks within ourselves, paving the way for personal growth and development. During this introspective journey, we can unearth hidden potential and forge a renewed sense of purpose.

**Overcoming Paralysis: Taking Action**

Although the Chariot reversed hints at moments of stagnation, it also encourages us to reclaim our agency. The charioteer must not succumb to inaction but instead find the courage to reignite their drive. Action, even in small steps, can break the shackles of inertia and propel us forward once more.

**Realigning with the Right Path**

The Chariot reversed serves as a *gentle nudge* to reassess our current trajectory. It asks us to be honest with ourselves about our desires and goals. Are we pursuing a path that genuinely resonates with our soul’s purpose? If not, the Chariot reversed prompts us to recalibrate our course, realigning ourselves with a truer sense of purpose.

**Embracing Patience and Surrender**

In a world that often glorifies rapid progress, the Chariot reversed advocates the virtues of patience and surrender. Instead of forcing outcomes, we are encouraged to let go of the need for immediate results. Surrendering to the flow of life allows us to adapt to circumstances and embrace the process, even when it deviates from our original plans.

**Control and Power Struggles**

In matters of the heart, the Chariot reversed can also signify control and power struggles within the relationship.

These obstacles may include outside influences, such as family, friends, or societal expectations, putting strain on the connection between partners. In such cases, it’s vital for the couple to come together as a united front and maintain open lines of communication to face these external challenges.

**Impulsivity and Rash Decisions**

The Chariot reversed may also caution against acting impulsively or making rash decisions in matters of the heart. It’s crucial to take a step back and evaluate situations carefully before making significant changes or judgments about the relationship.

**Realigning with Love’s True Path**

Amidst the challenges indicated by the Chariot reversed, there is an opportunity for growth and transformation.

By recognizing the need for emotional authenticity and vulnerability, both partners can rediscover the love that initially brought them together.

**Finding Balance and Harmony**

In love, as in life, balance is key. The Chariot reversed reminds us that relationships require a delicate balance between individuality and togetherness.

## The Chariot Reversed Symbolism:

In tarot, the association of deities with specific cards can vary depending on different belief systems, cultures, and interpretations. There is no fixed or universally agreed-upon association of deities with the Chariot reversed specifically. However, some tarot practitioners and enthusiasts might draw connections between the Chariot (both upright and reversed) and various deities from different mythologies.

In the context of the Chariot card, some interpretations may suggest connections with deities related to themes of control, determination, struggle, and overcoming obstacles. For instance:

Mars: Mars is the Roman god of war, associated with courage, strength, and assertiveness. The Chariot’s symbolism of victory and determination may resonate with Mars’ qualities.

Ares: In Greek mythology, Ares is the god of war, embodying the competitive and combative nature of the Chariot.

Athena: As the Greek goddess of wisdom and strategy, Athena’s qualities might align with the idea of making well-thought-out decisions while navigating challenges represented by the Chariot reversed.

[Freyja:](https://teaandrosemary.com/freya-goddess/) In Norse mythology, Freyja is associated with love, fertility, and war. The Chariot’s themes of inner conflicts and assertiveness might connect to some aspects of Freyja’s nature.

However, the Chariot is also #7 in the Tarot, which is God’s number, so it is often associated with any creator in any pantheon, as well as Adam, Eve, and sometimes Lilith.

When you consider the Chariot reversed, think about what you’re *not* embodying from a certain deity. What are you struggling to learn that will turn you “upright” again? This can also be a sign that you should work with one of these deities in order to correct any imbalances shown through this card.
