 Light the Blue candle and speak these words over the candle's flame as it burns and emits smoke into your bedroom:

***Most unrested I have been***

Please restore what's lost within

No crash, no daze, and no demise

Please let me sleep when I close my eyes

Now light the White candle and watch the smoke from both of the candles' flames swirl around and disperse as you chant:

Both Blue and White

Do surround my bed tonight

Through the air disperse and creep

To bring about a peaceful sleep
