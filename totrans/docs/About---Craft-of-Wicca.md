## What is Wicca to you?

Do you find yourself pouring over complicated recipes with tons of ingredients, trying to time everything perfectly?

 Wicca is about simplicity to me.

Here at Craft of Wicca, I focus on the personal side of Wicca. Your practice should work with what you have and fit into your schedule. It’s a return to ancient practices and the natural world.

 Most importantly, it should feel right to *you*.

Hello! My name is Ceridwen.

I took an interest in Wicca early on. I was born in the backwoods of upstate New York and always felt a deep connection with nature.

I was fortunate to have understanding parents and a friend whose mother was a practicing Wiccan.

 I used to do chores around the house to save up money just to get the great classic books like Scott Cunningham’s *Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner* and Silver RavenWolf’s *American Folk Magick*.

By the end of high school, I had taken to <g class="gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="16" data-gr-id="16">deep</g> study of tarot and even the Old Irish language (proto-Gaelic) to get to the source of the ancient druids and Pagan traditions.

I used to be an avid poster at the now-defunct Spirit Online.

 I have continued to live in close harmony with nature in rural Connecticut. After twenty years of practice, I have decided to start this educational site on what I’ve learned along the way.

Love and Peace,

 ### Ceridwen Ward
