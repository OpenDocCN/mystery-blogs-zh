As with any kind of spell I need to stress these vinegar spells for enemies need to be used carefully.

If you want to improve your spellcasting results, [take a moment to take the magick ability test](https://spellguru.co/magick-test/). It can help you find your strengths and the best way to channel your abilities against your enemies.

## Why Use Vinegar In These Spells?

Vinegar spells for enemies have their roots in ancient times the ancient Babylonians 3000 B.C. discovered vinegar when fermenting wine and it has been used for spells since that time.

It is a potent acidic bitter liquid that can be harnessed to banish your enemies and the brilliant thing about vinegar is that it’s in your cupboard at home all ready for you to use at any time.

Vinegar is cleansing and cleanses you of people you want to be free off, it is acetic and the bacteria forms on it and means there is slow growth in your spell it cant be stopped easily.

There is an old French phrase ‘vin aigre’ literally translated as sour wine. When someone leaves a sour taste in your month your vinegar spells will cleanse them from your life.

The good news is you can use vinegar in a freezer spell and it is perfectly used in candle magic spells because the heat works to intensify your spell.

## **Vinegar Banishing Spells**

#### Sour Be gone

When somebody sours your life, annoys you by being in it, causes you irritation and harm then you want them out of it. You can switch off your cell and ignore them but they are still in your head. This spell gets them gone from there.

**Ease of Use Beginner Level**

**Stuff you need**

Pen and Paper

White vinegar

A glass jar

Teaspoon Mustard seeds

How to Cast this Spell

A simple spell Pour a cup of vinegar into a glass jar add the mustard seeds that hold the seeds of your thoughts steady in the liquid.

Add the name of the person you wish to banish from your life and your thoughts

Write the reason why you wish them gone ( this might take some time)

Now the important thing to remember is that you are going to open the jar once a day for 7 days outside in the moonlight and blow across the top of the jar. You are blowing away the person from your life banishing them from thoughts. When you do this think of them blowing across the stars vanishing never to bother you again. The Moon Goddess will lift them from your thoughts.

After the week flush the vinegar and paper down the toilet where it belongs. Carried away by water in a constant flush.

**Magick Tip**

**Depending on how far this person has got into your head it might be you have to continue opening the jar for a whole month to let every part of the moon cycle help you on your path to removing them. The full moon is the strongest day you should feel your spirits lifting on that day.**
