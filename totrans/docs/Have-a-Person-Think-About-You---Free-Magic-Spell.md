**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Packet of seeds of your choice

*   Pot of soil (to grow them)

*   A small copper object such as a penny

 On a night when the Moon is waxing, go outside and hold the penny in the moonlight. Bury the penny in the soil in the pot. Sprinkle the seeds on top to form the initial of the other persons name.

As the seeds germinate, love should also grow. Remember that just as plants need nurturing so does love, so you will need to look after the growing seeds.

It is said that the plants will grow and flourish if the love is meant to be, but will wither and die if there is no real energy in the relationship. For those who are not very good at plant-care, you might choose to put a reminder to nurture somewhere prominent.
