"Spirits undead, please listen to my request. I'm really sad in this life all days are the same
everyone in my daily time doesn't understand that my life is not their game. So I ask if you make me a vampire and werewolf, a powerful hybrid. Give me special fangs: when blood I feed, they grow of a vampire and when I howl, of a werewolf. Please make me who I ask to be, so mote it be"
