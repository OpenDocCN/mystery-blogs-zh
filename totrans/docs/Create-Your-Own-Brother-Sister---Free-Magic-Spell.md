Does this really work?

No, you can't create a physical being from nothing. You could try a wish spell, or casting on your parents [please don't cast over others] but ultimately if you want a younger sibling it's either adoption, or the natural way [and even then you can't pick your future siblings gender, look, or interests]

no this wont work nekoshema is correct it is a fake spell

maybe, I will do this spell now to see if it works.

You can not create a human from nothing. Even if you could, why toy with a life?

does it work if you want to have twin siblings?

Unfortunately this spell does not work at all. The entire premise of it is deeply flawed. The closest you might find to what you are after would be through a spell for fertility, which would need to be done during the time-period that the people are trying to conceive.
