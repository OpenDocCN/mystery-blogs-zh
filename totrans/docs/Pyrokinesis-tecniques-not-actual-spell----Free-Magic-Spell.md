## Casting Instructions for 'Pyrokinesis(tecniques not actual spell)'

Pyrokinetics are the fire-based aspect of psionics. They include the creation of as well as manipulation, of fire. It is fire AND Psi. This is an advanced skill, and can be dangerouse to others around you if you don't have controll over it. The key to Pyrokinesis is focusing on what you want the flame or fire to do, and willing it to happen.

The Dancing Flame
The best way to develope and train your Pyrokinesis skills is a technique called the dancing flame. Get in a relaxed position, and grab a match. Light the match on fire and focus on the flame. Create a ''tunnel'' between you and the flame. Now visualize the flame going out. You must be focusing on only the flame. With enough will power, and hard concentration, the flame will go out. Putting a flame or fire out is the easiest part of Pyrokinesis. Making the flame or fire relight is the hard part. Once you can make the flame burn out, Focus on the flame relighting. After a few weeks of doing this, you will notice that once the flame is out, you will be able to see the ember start to turn red again as though it wanted to relight. Once you practice enough, it will relight. This is the easiest way to develope and train Pyrokinesis. This techique DOES WORK!!

Lighting a Candle
Pyrokinesis may be accomplished by concentrating on, the wick of a candle. After going through the usual preliminary procedures, eg. meditation, visualize the wick as being made up of many thousands of swirling dots or spheres. As you visualize them, see them swirling faster and faster, and as they swirl faster and faster, feel them becoming hot...becoming hotter and hotter until they glow like miniature suns. When the dots are glowing brightly, bring part of your focus back to the wick as a whole, while still seeing and feeling the excited molecules. See the wick as a whole become hot and start to glow. Then, visualize it bursting into flame, perhaps accompanied by some sort of gesture, such as a flick of the hand or a snap of the fingers, if you are feeling dramatic.
You may find that it is helpful, at least at first, to produce a psi ball around the wick while attempting this, not so much for sake of the energy as for concentration. It may also be helpful by way of preparation, to focus on an already-lit candle and use your mind to change the shape or movement of the flame; concentrate on the base of the flame, the faintly glowing blue part.

The opposite can also be done (putting the flame out). I mention this in the Cryokinesis section.
