What do you mean by ''soda'' exactly? Baking soda, or soda water? Either way, the mixture is harmless, though it probably will not taste very good. It will not take away the feelings of fear and shame permanently, but I can see it helping if you are trying to overcome a situation, or work through these emotions.
