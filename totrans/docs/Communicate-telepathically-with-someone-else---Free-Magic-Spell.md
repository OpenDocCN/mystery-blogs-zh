# Communicate telepathically with someone else

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This spell allows you to communicate with someone else telepathically. This is not like movies or TV shows where you could use telepathically instead of a cell phone, but this spell can help you if you want to talk to someone else with anyone else knowing. Also it would be best if you call upon the power of the elements to aid you in the spell, by saying ''Wind, Earth, Fire, Water, I call to you to make this spell magic so mote it be'' (Date posted: 2/23/17)

Please note: It helps if you visualize a mirror, and think of it as the object you are looking through to communicate with the other person. '' Harken oh winds of the earth, help me to communicate, I need to talk to (name of intended) and this call can not wait. May this signal never fall, (name of intended) please answer me, as I send this call'' ''so mote it be''
Then bind the spell ''for the good of all and to harm none, this spell is bound and is to not be undone, by the power of three times three, as I do will so mote it be''
Now you can telepathically talk to the person as if you were having a conversation with them normally. You can think what you want to say or you can speak it. Either way, you will hear a response through your thoughts as will the other person you are talking to. When are done with your conversation use this spell to end the telepathic communication
''the words were sent, my message received; my will has been done, this call I now leave'' ''so mote it be'' Now bind the spell and visualize the mirror shattering.

What happens if you don't say the spell to get rid of the conversation

... That's a lot of ingredients...

I doubt this spell works. Strengthen your psychic abilities and try your hand at telepathy, but there's little evidence it's possible.

I agree with Nekoshema. This has a high chance of not working, even with all those ingredients. Throwing tons of ingredients in a spell wont automatically make it work. If you want a easier way, just talk to them. Im not saying it TOTALLY wont work but most likely youll fail🌻💙

Love this needed it and found it thank you nature
