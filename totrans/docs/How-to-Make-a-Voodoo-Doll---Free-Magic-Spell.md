 Get out all your items first, so you don't have to stop to go grab them.

Light the incense if you have any, and begin sewing a gingerbreadman-esque shape out of whatever cloth you have. Make sure to leave a hole along the hem.

Stick your fingers (or tweezers) inside the hole and pull the inside out, so that the hemming is concealed. 

Sew beads and sequins on if you have them, then begin stuffing the doll. Put everything you want to go inside in there, then sew up the hole.

You can write runes on the fabric, sew button eyes on the doll, put your makeup on it, and/or make it clothes to help tie the doll to you even more.

Last, if you burned incense, take the ash from the incense and rub it into the fabric of the doll.

And that's it. You just made a voodoo doll. Congratulations.

Alternatives:

-if you don't have fabric, you can take a plastic zip lock bag and tie it with rubber bands to be vaguely person shaped. I don't recommend this, though.

-if you cannot obtain the dna of the person, you can print off a picture of them and put it in instead.

-you can light a candle instead of incense and put the doll's feet and head into the melted wax instead of rubbing incense ash into it.

-you can do this by a river and instead of using incense, let the water flow over the doll once its finished

-if you don't have synthetic stuffing like in stuffed animals, you can use grass, ash, cloth, etc.

ps. Be nice to the voodoo doll.

Could you make a voodoo doll to represent a specific place on the body?

How do you dispose of the voodoo doll once your purpose is served?

burn it. then bury the burned doll in the middle of the woods

This is a simple poppet or doll. Dolls are not voodoo exclusive. You do not need to practice vodou to work with poppets and dolls. Create the doll as this person outlines, and stuff it with herbs associated with your desired goal. If you want to use this in love workings, use herbs associated with love. If this is for luck, herbs associated with luck, etcetera.

Would it be possible to use hot glue instead of sewing? I have just lost my favorite sewing needle.
