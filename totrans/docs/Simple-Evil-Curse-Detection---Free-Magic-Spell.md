**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Uncolored Wax

*   Time

*   An object you want to test for curses

 1\. Take the wax and roll it into 6-10 little balls. They don’t have to be perfect or even good. 

2\. Set them in a circle around the object you are testing.

3\. Wait for at least a day.

4\. Check on the object. If the wax pieces have changed color or melted, the object has a curse.

5\. Try to avoid touching the object for a bit because the wax will have agitated the curse and made it dangerous.

I have never heard of this and I doubt it will change the colour of the wax. There would be other signs to indicate an object is cursed. You can also sense the energy shift or notice patterns. If you are concerned, you can cleanse the object, seal the object, or remove the object from your home.
