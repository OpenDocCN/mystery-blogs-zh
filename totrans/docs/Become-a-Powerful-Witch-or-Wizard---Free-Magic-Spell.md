does this work ???

No. Witches don't have any special powers, it's just the title you give someone who practices witchcraft [just like how a Christian follows Christianity, and there's no spell to make them a more powerful Christian] if you want to become ''more powerful'' you need to study and practice, but witches don't have special powers, Witchcraft is nothing like in the movies.

You gain more power through practice. If you wish to make this before studying, it could set your I mention, but simply drinking something will not give you more power.

Practice. That's the best 'Power' spell you can find
