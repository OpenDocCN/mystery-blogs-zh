 To find your personal number, use the table below to allocate a number to each letter in your name. Add up all the numbers. If the total is over nine,keep adding them up until you have just one digit. For example "John Smith" is 1+7+5+5+3+4+1+4+5=35, 3+5=8, so eight is John Smith's personal number. If your number adds up to 11 or 22,do not reduce it to one digit; 22 is the "master" number, and 11 represents those who experince revaltions.
