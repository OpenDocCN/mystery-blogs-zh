Does this spell work

Well, if you do the chant for long enough it will eventually turn. Because it was going to anyways thanks to its timer.

In short, setting sarcasm aside, no. This does not work. All it demonstrates is what's called false correlation. Which is when an action gets mistakungly associated with an event, even though they are completely unrelated, because they occurred together.
