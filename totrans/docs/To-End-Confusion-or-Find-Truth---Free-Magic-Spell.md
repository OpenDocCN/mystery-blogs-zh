# To End Confusion or Find Truth

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This is a spell you can use if your confused or want to know the truth about something. This is one of the easiest I have learned in this category, and I hope it's the same for you too.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'To End Confusion or Find Truth'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Memories

*   3 Candles that Represent your feelings(will be explained in Instructions)

*   Your Mythical Creature/Guardian(If you don't have one, that's fine.)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Memories

*   3 Candles that Represent your feelings(will be explained in Instructions)

*   Your Mythical Creature/Guardian(If you don't have one, that's fine.)

Explaining the candles and mythical creature first. Choose a candle color that represents what you feel about your confusion, or how you feel about the situation.
Color Code...Blue: Calm. Red: Love. Orange: Jealousy. Yellow: Happy. Purple: Stressed. White: Hopeless. Teal: Loss. Grey: Lonely. Black: Satisfied. Green: Lively. Magenta: Sick/Sickness. Steel Blue: Sadness

Your mythical creature or guardian would be something like your Djinn or guardian dragon or angel. It's not necessary, and this will still work if you don't have one. It just guarantees more successful results if you do.
Light your candles.
Whenever you go to sleep, or to take a nap, go through all your memories as your falling asleep. EVERYTHING you can remember. It doesn't just have to be about what your curious about, but include that too.

When you fall asleep, you'll dream about the answer or a way to solve your confusion. If you don't get it when you wake up from your dream, think about it. It might take a while to understand because your brain has a weird way of presenting things, as well as this spell or ritual.

This shouldn't be too hard, but if you have troubles, message me and I'll help you.

Can you use more than 3 candles?

Since it represents your emotions and you feel you should use more, then go for it, but I would try and use three for the top three emotions. You can use more, but I don't think it'll enhance the spell. [if anything, I feel it'll add more confusion]

wait when do we blow out the candles??
