The third time, hold the picture/sample and crush it or tear it in your magick hand. If a picture, signature, strand of hair, etc. Burn it. If a bodily fluid, mix with witch hazel to purify, and pour it down a magick waste hole.

End spell if you have an ending ritual. If not, simply clean up and close the the circle.
