# Basic Circle Casting Part II

This is how to take your circle down once you have completed your ritual or magickal workings.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Basic Circle Casting Part II'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A yellow, red, blue, green, and purple candle OR five white tea lights

*   An athame or wand (optional)

*   A candle snuffer

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A candle snuffer

 When you are finished with your ritual or magickal workings, it is important to remember to take down the circle. Never leave the energy you have raised hanging.

Begin this at the east of your already cast circle. Point with your wand, athame, or pointer finger at the eastern candle, and call out: "Farewell, Air, Guardian of the East. You are now dismissed." Draw a pentacle above the Air candle (this is saluting it) and extinguish it with the snuffer. Never just blow out your candles. This is considered bad luck.

Move to the southernmost candle of your circle. Point with your wand, athame, or index finger and recite: "Farewell, Fire, Guardian of the South. You are now dismissed." Salute the element, and extinguish the candle.

Do likewise for the remaining elements in your circle until all the candles are out. Then, you are free to go.

Feel free to be creative with these two spells! Write your own chants for when you invoke and dismiss the elements, or maybe even write certain chants for special occasions like holidays, sabbats, and such. You don't always have to use candles to represent the elements, I just prefer to. Some people use a wand, a feather, or incense for Air, a star or perhaps a piece of charcoal for Fire, a bowl of water for Water, a stone or a bowl of salt for Earth, and a statue or picture of a deity for Spirit. Feel free to get creative and personalize your own circle casting. This is your practice. Don't feel pressured to imitate others.
