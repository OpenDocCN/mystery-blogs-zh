**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   White candle

*   White flowers petals

*   Mandarin oil

First recognize that your partner is who he/she is because of his/her previous life before you - so honor and respect his/her previous experiences as being an integral part of him/her. Rather than focusing on the ex and feeling insecure do this ritual.

Light a white candle and surround with white flowers, perhaps roses or lilies. Burn some mandarin oil for happiness and clarity and say this charm: ''I am free to focus on what is now. The fire of love shows me how. My mind is clear to dream my dreams. My love is mine, my life serene.''

Do this as often as you need to.

I would flesh this out a little. Spend more time reflecting and journaling as you burn the candle and oil. This can be more of a ritual over a ''say these words and things are okay'' type of spell. They said you can repeat this as needed, but if you require a spell to overcome emotions surrounding the past, you require more than a quick spell. You require shadow work. Meditate on your emotions, let them come up, without judgement, then flow past. Journaling about them as you meditate can help you process and release these emotions. After each time you pause to reflect and journal, say the chant again and return to your meditation. Once you have a calm feeling, like a sigh of relief or a weight has been lifted, you can end the session. Things we resist, persist. You will need to work through these feelings in some way, and while this spell can help, depending on how strong these emotions are, you might need to dive deeper into your subconscious.
