(Chant six times) O gods of the underworld beneath I wish thyself to become a vampire. Thy consequences are known, and I will have the benefits of one like flying and running faster than any before. I will never die, thyself will be immortal. Give me this gods of the underworld. Make me what I want to be so mote it be.

Wait one hour and test your powers. If your powers are real and this works you must drink human blood or you will die. By the way your age and strength will determine when you get your fangs.
