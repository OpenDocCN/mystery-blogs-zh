Put the chili powder into the water and mix it with all the pencils, colored pencils, and pens. Then hold it above your head and say this spell 3 times:

Oh God of evil,
Oh god of good,
Listen to this understood
I need this nay want
Bring this to me in the front.

After you have said the spell 3 times take out the pencils and put them in your mouth to get ready for the finale of POURING THE ENTIRE GLASS ON YOUR HEAD. p.s. I would take a shower after that.
