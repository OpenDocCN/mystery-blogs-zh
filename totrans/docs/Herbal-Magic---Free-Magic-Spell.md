 Herbs can be mixed and combined to produce a "recipe" that's just right for each of us.
Since the Sun sign you were born under has such an amazing influence on your health and
well-being, using the herbs that correspond with that sign alone can be a tremendous help in
times of stress or illness. Here's a short list of herbs that seem to be tailor-made for each of the
signs, due to their associations with both the planetary ruler and the positive qualities of that sign.

ARIES - MARS
Allspice, basil, cayenne, garlic, ginger, mustard, onion, pepper.
It's no secret that Aries is the astrological equivalent of a bullet.
It's a red-hot burst of energy that's capable of overcoming any
obstacle by charging straight for it. The ruler of Aries is Mars, the "red"
planet, the ancient god of war who was known for his equally fiery
temperament. No wonder, then, the herbs that correspond with your sign
are also a bit "hot" to the taste. Use them in cooking to raise your
endorphins, the substance Mars loves best.
TAURUS - Venus
Apple, apricot, blackberry, cherry, heather, hibiscus, raspberry, rose.
Taurus is the sign that's fondest of the pleasures that life inside
these bodies can provide. Whether it's a blazing sunset, a symphony by
Mozart, or a delicious meal, you folks are experts at enjoying the
physical delights of the senses. It's no surprise that the herbs you'll
enjoy most are the sweet ones, since your planet, Venus, is the
purveyor of sweetness. Use each of them to satisfy that sweet tooth.
GEMINI - Mercury
Clover, eyebright, fennel, lemongrass, lemon verbena, marjoram, parsley.
Your quick-witted, fleet-footed energy just loves variety - in fact, the
expression "variety is the spice of life" was written with you in mind.
Each of these herbs provide a different type of taste, and most can be
combined in a light, aromatic tea you can sip on the run. Use clove or
slippery elm to protect against gossip and to keep your thoughts and
actions grounded.
CANCER - Moon
Aloe, lemon balm, chamomile, mimosa, lavender, lilac.
Nurturing is your business, Cancer, and you distribute your soothing
touch to one and all. There's nothing you like better than a home that
smells good, too, whether it's because there's something wonderful
simmering on the stove, a vase of fresh flowers on the dining room
table, or a warm, fragrant bubble bath waiting for you upstairs. Each
of the herbs listed above are known for their ability to calm, heal, or
bring a wonderful aroma to the environment. Use aloe to soothe burns
and scrapes and chamomile for a wonderful bedtime tea.
LEO - Sun
Chicory, cinnamon, goldenseal, rosemary, St. John's Wort, sandalwood.
Your planet is the Sun, Leo, the source of life and warmth that keeps
us all alive and provides us with the energy we need to keep pursuing our
life's quest. It makes perfect sense, then, that the bright, cheerful
sunflower would be the perfect representation of your equally bright
and happy sign. Herbs like goldenseal and St. John's Wort are tailor-made
for you, too, since their ability to keep the body resistant to illness
and depression are well known. Mix a bit of chicory with your morning
coffee to help remove any obstacles that come up.
VIRGO - Mercury
Caraway, dill, eyebright, horehound, lily of the valley, marjoram, savory.
Your quick-thinking meticulous sign likes nothing better than a mental
challenge, Virgo, whether it's organizing a pile of papers at the
office, solving a puzzle, or learning a new skill. The herbs listed
above are all well known for their subtle abilities to strengthen the
mind, and many can be mixed together in teas to give you a boost you
often need at the end of a long day. The lily of the valley seems
perfect for you, too, with its subtle, "clean" scent and delicate flowers.
LIBRA - Venus
Catnip, passion flower, persimmon, rose, sugar cane, violet.
There's no sign as fond of pleasing others as yours, Libra, whether it's
by saying just the right thing to bring warring factions together, or by
using your polite charm to draw the object of your desires closer. Of
course, catnip is famous for its effects on our feline friends, but its
also traditionally used in conjunction with rose petals to bring loving
relationships that last forever. Since you're ruled by Venus, you're
capable of being every bit as sweet as the sugar cane - but if you need
a bit of help to attract a beloved, use this potent plant (sugar cane)
that's long been used to conjure love - sweetly.
SCORPIO - Pluto/Mars
Ginseng, dill, patchouli, pomegranate, saffron, vanilla.
As fond as you are of intensity and intimacy, Scorpio, it's no wonder
the herbs you'll love best are famous for their use in stirring up
passion. Drink ginseng tea (or offer some to your beloved) to induce a
magnetic physical attraction. Wear patchouli to arouse lust and silently
conjure the magic of the Beltane rituals. Present the object of your
desire with a pomegranate, the fruit traditionally associated with
seductive Pluto, your ruling planet.
SAGITTARIUS - Jupiter
Anise, clove, fig, hyssop, mugwort, myrtle, nutmeg, rosemary, sage.
There's no sign that hangs on to youth with more fervency and
determination than yours Sagittarius. To keep that youthful appearance
and disposition going as you travel the world in search of yet another
experience, drink a tea made of anise, rosemary, and Vervain. To aid in
making your dreams more prophetic than they already are, use mugwort.
Burn clove incense to attract the wealth you'll need to pay for your travels.
CAPRICORN - Saturn
Comfrey, horsetail, mint, poppy, sassafras, woodruff.
You've always been described as a very "focused" sign, Capricorn, intent
on self-sufficiency and material success. The influence of your planet,
Saturn, gives you the ambition and self-discipline to attain those
goals, and to ensure success and prosperity in business matters, too.
Each of the herbs mentioned above are known for their ability to attract
that success, and most can be mixed together in a tea.
AQAURIUS - Uranus/Saturn
Anise, bittersweet, citron, dandelion, lemon verbena, rosemary, sage.
Your sign is a cerebral one, Aquarius, and your ability to turn "odd" or
eccentric ideas into strokes of genius is well known. Since
communication (and mass communication in particular) is your specialty,
the herbs above are all associated with the air principle, which rules
the intellectual side of life. To increase your already powerful
intuition, use citron, clover, or rosemary. Above all else, listen to
that intuition. It will seldom prove to be wrong.
Pisces - Neptune/Jupiter
Aloe, bay, cotton, eucalyptus, lavender, Norfolk Island pine, rue.
As the most sensitive and psychic of all signs, Pisces, yours is the one
that requires help to ward off the adverse thoughts and intentions of
others. Since you have no boundaries to keep you separate from others,
you also need protection against negative influences. To that end, use
rue, a powerful herb known to ward off ills of every kind. To stay
positive and healthy keep a lavender plant growing either outside or inside your home.
