This requires an edit. This is a combination of a simmer pot and potion. To make a simmer pot, you take water, preferably blessed water like moon water, then add herbs and leave it to simmer while the scent fills the home and charges a specific energy. I would research aromatic items with protective properties so your house smells nice to you. Stir the brew clockwise to bring the energy to you. You can also chant while you stir to set your intention further.
