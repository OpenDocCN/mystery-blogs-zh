 ## What are Amber Crystals and Gemstones?

### Formation of Amber

Amber is not a traditional mineral, but rather a fossilized tree resin. It forms over millions of years as the sticky sap of ancient trees hardens and transforms into a stunning, gem-like material. The organic origin of amber makes it unique among gemstones and imbues it with remarkable properties.

 ### Colors and Varieties

Although often thought of as a warm, golden hue, amber can be found in various colors, including red, green, blue, and even black. The color of the amber depends on factors such as the tree species, the environment, and the age of the fossilized resin. Some specimens contain inclusions, like insects or plant matter, which can make them even more valuable and fascinating.

The clarity of an amber gemstone refers to how clear or opaque it is. Some amber may have inclusions or other imperfections, which can add character and interest to the stone. However, if you prefer a more uniform appearance, look for amber with fewer inclusions.

### Size and Shape

Amber can come in a variety of sizes and shapes, from small beads to large pendants. Consider what type of jewelry you want to make or what type of piece you want to add to your collection.

Once you have chosen your amber gemstone, it’s important to take good care of it to ensure it lasts a lifetime. Here are some tips for caring for your amber gemstone:

 ### Cleaning

To clean your amber gemstone, simply wipe it with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid using any harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as these can damage the surface of the stone.

 ### Storing

When not wearing your amber gemstone, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. This will help prevent any fading or discoloration over time.

### Protecting

Amber is a relatively soft gemstone, so it’s important to protect it from scratches and other damage. Avoid wearing it while doing any strenuous activities or while working with harsh chemicals.

### Recharging

Finally, you can help maintain the healing properties of your amber gemstone by recharging it periodically. Simply place it in direct sunlight or under a full moon for a few hours to restore its energy.
