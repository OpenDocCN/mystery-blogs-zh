I'm an Indian. And for crying out loud this doesn't make you immortal... But it will definitely help in untimely deaths like if you are cursed or something.

This chant saved my life but it isnt Wicca or magick but rather Hindu. It didnt keep me alive after knocking on Deaths door though but rather kept me safe during difficult medical times.

You cannot become immortal.

Agreed, and just to cry out loud...''nothing'' will ever be ACTUALLY immortal, nature and magic...they have a balance, life and death, destruction and creation, positive and negative...if one would be immortal, that would mean that life and death would become unbalanced, even IF it would be possible to be or become immortal...you would doom yourself and everyone around you, as most likely the primordial forces of life and death would both try to crush the anomaly to restore the balance.

Won't make you immortal, but could help avoid death when you're ill.

You wont become immortal I think it helps avoid death but maybe in the future with technology you could
