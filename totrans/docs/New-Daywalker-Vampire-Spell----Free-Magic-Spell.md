Is this spell fake or real?

Every spell that claims things such has shape-shifting in to a vampire, mermaid, etc. ; bending the elements ; controlling the weather, is fake.

Easy way to filter out spells if it is in this sties Fantasy or Trick sections they are far more likely to be fake.

Changing your physical form isn't possible, even if it was you are most likely to put yourself in a very harmful manner. True magick is an energy field from nature's core given the fact that since magick is a neutral energy source that can be practiced by anyone doesnt mean it is able to turn the human body into a different form.

how long does it take

It does not work. The idea is based in fantasy.
