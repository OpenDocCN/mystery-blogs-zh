You can't become a night fury, nor gain their powers. You're human. You can work with Dragons similar to spirits, but you'll always be human.

You can, but not physically, only in the astral plane.

While I've never personally seen a night fury, they are similar in appearance to Chaos Dragons. I'll give a small ''maybe astral'' since astral transformation is possible, but I doubt this spell would work either. You don't really need a spell to astrally transform anyway. They might help some, but typically, you just think about what you want your form to appear as and it changes.

You cannot physically transform into a dragon.
