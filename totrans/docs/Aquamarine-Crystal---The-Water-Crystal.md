Hi and welcome to Wicca Now. As you may already know, Wicca Now is a site where Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/), this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or this article on [fluorite](https://wiccanow.com/fluorite/). Today I thought we’d focus on another beautiful crystal, namely aquamarine.

## About Aquamarine Crystals

**Aquamarine is a variety of [beryl](https://wiccanow.com/beryl/) and takes its name from the Latin *aqua marina *meaning “water of the sea”. The crystal ranges in colour from translucent to opaque blue and aqua. The ancient Greeks believed the stone to be a mermaids treasure and often carried a piece of aquamarine with them as a talisman, believing that it would keep them safe at sea. The stone can be found in Brazil, Africa and the United States. During the middle ages, the stone was believed to counteract the effects of poison and was often used for medicinal purposes. In China, it was used to fashion figurines and small trinkets and in Turkey, aquamarine was often used to adorn the hilts of swords.**
