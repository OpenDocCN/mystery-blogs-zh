**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 black candles

*   Protection incense

 Light three black candles and burn some protection incense. Chant three times repeatedly: "Protection around me, protection surround me, I call upon you to protect me. Mother Earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. I invoke the elements of the universe. The stars in the midnight sky. Protect me and keep me safe from all negativity, harm, and evil forces. Watch out for me and embrace me. As I will it, so mote it be!"

If you are performing this protection spell as a coven, for a friend, family member, or loved one; have each member of your coven repeat this chant. If you are doing this to protect someone other than yourself then simply change the word me to the persons name. Having that person present or a picture of that person will enhance this spell. When you are done waft the incense smoke towards you, your coven, or the person. If you are using an image of the person then move their image back and forth through the protection smoke.
