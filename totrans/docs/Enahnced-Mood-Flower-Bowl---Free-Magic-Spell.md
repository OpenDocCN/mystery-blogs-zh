**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   windowsill or windproof/ weatherproof spot outside

Put the flower petals (fresh is best) in the bowl to dry.
As they are drying, every now and then ''toss'' them around in the bowl to mix them up.
After 5-7 days, when they finish drying, rub both hands in the flower petals to give yourself a better mood throughout the day.
**You may want to colour code petals (red for love/passion, green for wealth/prosperity, etc.), but I just use a mix to give me a better overall mood.**
**I also added grass, pine needles, clovers, and other leaves, just 'cause.**
