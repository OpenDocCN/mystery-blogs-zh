Step 1:
This must be done in a place you will not be disturbed, draw a line on the floor and sit down behind it, place the chosen medium in front.

Step 2:
Begin meditating, this will bring you into a world with your spirit guardian, it is here you begin to make a contract, this is up to you what you will say to the spirit and from there will also be the limitations of your spirit, the stronger the contract, the stronger the spirit.

Step 3:
The contract will only be completed when the spirit takes your hand and you take its, this is done in the physical world by crossing the line and touching the medium.

Awaken and wear your medium, this is now your weapon against spirits, basically this is your way of combating the things that will hurt you.

Note:
The line represents the boundary of the spirit and physical world, you and the medium represent these worlds when you crossed the line it means you have fully decided on being part of their world and interact with them completely.
