## Is Today Your Birthday?

The most important thing on your birthday is that you have a crystal clear vision held in your mind of what it is you hope to achieve. Create a mental picture of where you want to be 12 months from now and focus on it with all your might.

### Aquarius

It will pay you to keep your thoughts to yourself over the next 24 hours. No doubt there is much you would like to say but with communications planet Mercury about to turn retrograde it’s probably too late. The less said now the less harm done later.

### Pisces

You need to tighten up a bit on the money front, where you have been even more wasteful than usual of late. Find new ways to make savings and new ways to bring in extra income. Above all, don’t let others grow rich at your expense.

### Aries

Make sure others are aware of your thoughts and feelings today. Feel free to give your opinions on a wide range of subjects and don’t be intimidated by people who like to claim they are “experts”. Most likely they know a lot less than you.

### Taurus

Steer clear of people who seem to be negative all the time. If those you socialize with only ever come up with reasons not to do things then you clearly need a new set of friends. All things are possible if you wish hard enough for them.

### Gemini

The critical side of your nature will be much in evidence today but you must be sure that what you say is one hundred per cent true. If it isn’t then it could be you on the receiving end when your ruler Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow.

### Cancer

Take any tales of woe you hear today with the proverbial pinch of salt, because almost certainly others are exaggerating their needs. Cancer is a hugely sensitive and compassionate sign but you can be a bit gullible at times as well, so watch out.

### Leo

Anyone who has been taking liberties with your generosity will soon learn that a Leo is not the best person to annoy. Say what you have to say, do what you have to do and then move on, preferably without those who have been using you.

### Virgo

Be careful what personal information you give out today as it could fall into the wrong hands and be used against you. Never forget that knowledge is power and the more you have of one the more you tend to have of the other one too.

### Libra

Not everyone will agree with what you choose to do today but that must not in any way lessen your determination to do it. Sometimes you can be a bit indecisive but now you must go to the other extreme and be unashamedly stubborn.

### Scorpio

Get any promises that others make to you in writing today because if you don’t pin them down there is a very strong chance that they will try to wriggle out of their commitments to you later on. Don’t give them any leeway at all.

### Sagittarius

You will have a lot to say for yourself today and that’s good. Be careful though that you don’t come across a bit too aggressive and scare potential allies away. You are entitled to your views but they are not of course the only views.

### Capricorn

If someone you don’t always get along with goes out of their way to be nice to you today don’t automatically assume that they are up to no good. It could be the case that they would rather be a friend than an enemy. What’s so bad about that?
