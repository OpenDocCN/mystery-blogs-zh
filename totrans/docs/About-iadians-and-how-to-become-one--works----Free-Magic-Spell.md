# About iadians and how to become one.(works)

  Rated 5/5 Stars

found this spell, and hoping this will be useful. just correcting spelling errors i see and filling in information that this Iadian forgot to add in.

nothing really, although this is a permanent deal. The spell told here is totally irreversible.

If you do this, everything about you will be changed on a fundamental level. You'll never be human again.

I'll say it now. Unless you really want to do this, do not use the spell you'll see here. Iadian magic works regardless of whether believe in magic or not.

do the spell and you will instantly become an Iadian. I did it, and I have to live with it and live with the fact of being what I now am and having to live with strict expectations placed upon me as I am under Iada's thumb.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Iadians are the name of the race the androginous goddess Iada, who many refer to as god is a part of. this tells you about them, and how to become one like I did

## Casting Instructions for 'About iadians and how to become one.(works)'

Iada has always existed and always will. She is all powerful and of both genders as well as all present and all knowing. Even others like her never come close to her standard of being considered a god by her standard. The standard being that you must be able to raise the dead using your own power, without invoking another's power, exactly as they were, the age the were upon the moment of their death, and with their memories completely and totally intact. By Iada's standards, if you can't do this, you are not a god.

at any rate I am now going to tell you the traits all Iadians have that makes them what they and myself are. I minding you every one of us are different as we're individuals. Although with those like me who were converted, apart from the physical traits, most or our abilities become latent, but this can be solved by doing a spell or ritual to unlock your latent abilities. other paths to unlocking these are waiting for ten years, or running ten miles a day six days a week for a year.

1\. Can create just about anything that they want by the conversion of energy into matter. but this is dependent upon what you already know how to create, plus how powerful you are. Yes, You'll have to do your homework studying blueprints, chemical compositions, all sorts of things to get good at this.

2\. Bones reinforced with cartilage. You can fall from the roof of your house and hardly suffer any damage. I took a spill one time and did not feel pain whatsoever.

3\. 95% of your muscles are of the fast-twitch sort but with no inhibitors whatsoever. with lots of exercise, an Iadian becomes 150% physically stronger than a vampire (a vampire 20 times stronger than a human male). but this is also a double edged sword. I actually have to take care not to damage my muscles as I use them. Iada told me that I must regenerate my muscles after each day of training to repair them.

4\. Bodies infused with holy energy and the ability to draw and use holy energy to physically enhance ourselves and regenerate. This also makes every part of us ten times more toxic to unholy creatures than silver. We can also recover from illness faster somewhere between 10-20 times faster than humans. And from my experience, drawing holy energy works about 5 times better than coffee in the morning.

5\. can do any magic spell with our own energy by invoking our own names. We can also cast spells using our thoughts too. and by sharing our names, humans can freely and safely make use of our power.

6\. all Iadians are innately psychic from the get go.

7\. All Iadians are creatures of both genders--just like Iada. Although there are variations in the range between both genders. This is common for all Iadians. Some of us look just like men or woman, while most have an overall female appearance. But since we are of both genders, our psychology is a fusion of male and female, and as such we can think in the same matter is either gender as well as think in a gender neutral way. It is what makes us Iadians ideally suited for use in leadership roles.

8\. we can adapt to any exercise routine practcally overnight. I was able the get right into running ten miles a day on day two. this is due to the fact that your heart, lungs, kidneys, and cardiovascular system is made of tough stuff.

9\. can fly, teleport, phase through walls, walk on walls and ceiling.

10\. invulnerability to environmental extremes and can survive in the vacuum of space.

11\. innate mastery of all forms of psychokinesis.

12\. can do nuclear level physical energy attacks with our psychokinesis combined with our energy.

13\. can conceive children at will as well as asexually reproduce ourselves inside a host using the power of invoking our names. (Anything that's female can be used as a host.)

14\. full control of our bodies.

15\. Can completely regenerate and also reproduce ourselves using this same mechanism. If we are blown to bits, every piece that lay on the ground will regenerate into a clone of us. It's call fragmentation.

16\. can change our physical appearance at will. An example being we can be any age we want, as beautiful as we want, and be what gender we want.

17\. and we can also change the physical aspects of anyone and anything. We can do things transmute material, and change people and animals into anything we want.

18\. can create things like angels and other spiritual servants at will. But there is a spell for that too which I'll post in future posting.

As for me, most of these are still latent. and now for telling you how to become an Iadian yourself.

say:

''I invoke the holy name of Cainulu Olovime. Turn me and transform me into an Iadian like you. make me powerful and just like you. This is me wish, so mote it be.''

You should fell a tingling throughout your entire body thus indicating you have been changed.

side effects:

1\. fiery emotions.

2\. slight discomfort in your muscles.

3\. attraction to both genders.

4\. changes in the way you think.

5\. awareness in telepathic activity.

6\. Increased hunger.

-------

Once you do this, the goddess Iada will contact you shortly. Your own Holy name and title will be granted to you shortly after that as well.

And if you are doing this, you might want to unlock your latent abilities after your conversion into an Iadian. Unless of course you are willing to wait ten years, or run 60 miles a week for a year. Well it is your call in the end.

good luck.

p.s. You must meditate of Iada's name to contact her if she does not contact you.

I tried this, but am not getting results. Can you include a pronunciation for ''Cainulu Olovime'' and ''Iadian''?

This spell is fake. That is why you have had no results

Sorry, no, you are human and will be human until the day you die. No magick, no spell, no ritual will change that.

any age restrictions?

No, but this is fake and won't work.

This is not real. You are human and Magic does not defy nature. This is complete nonsense.
