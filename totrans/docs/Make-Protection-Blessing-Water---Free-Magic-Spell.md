Slow this down and it should work. Light the candles, then put your hands over the water and charge it with Magikal energy. Feel it pooling in the water, imagine your desired goal. When you feel you have blessed the water, say the chant, then blow out the candles. Lighting candles, saying some words then blowing them out does nothing because you did not conjure any Magik to cast the spell.
