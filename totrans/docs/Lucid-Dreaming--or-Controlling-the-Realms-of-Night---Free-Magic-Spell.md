For when you want to change the path of a dream:
The most important thing to do in a dream is to gain consciousness. This is not as easy as it sounds, but it is possible to wake up and remain in the dream. All it means is that you gain command over your dream-self. I do this automatically anyway as an automatic reflex but in a much lesser extent to what you need - I begin chanting for protection. Anyway, once you have woken up, DO NOT open your eyes. That will obliterate the dream. Once you have woken up, you can do anything you want, but I recommend going into a deep meditative state beforehand and creating dream-weapons, for when you just can't escape. To create a dream weapon, you must be able to at least guess how each section would look or feel, and create it bit by bit. Anyway, once your weapon is created you can summon it at any time - just imagine that you are holding it.

For when you want to change how a dream passed (Temporal mastery):
Summon as much power as you can, and psychically grab the material of the dream, hence the need for a strong will. Then, imagine that you are pulling the material of the dream away, and see the passage of dream-time go backwards to the last part of the dream you found acceptable. At that point you use you will and power to ground the dream there. It tires you out though, but at this point you can use the previous technique to alter your dream.
