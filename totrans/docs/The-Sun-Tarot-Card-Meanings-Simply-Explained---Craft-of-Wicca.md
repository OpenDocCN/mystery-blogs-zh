## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the Sun card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and the question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

One interpretation of the Sun tarot card might be to view it as a symbol of self-care and personal growth. In this interpretation, the Sun card could suggest that the querent is taking good care of themselves and prioritizing their own well-being and that this is leading to positive personal growth and development.

 The Sun card could also indicate that the querent is feeling confident and optimistic about their own potential and that they are actively working to improve and better themselves.

 This interpretation could be especially relevant in today’s world, where self-care and personal growth are often emphasized as important aspects of overall well-being.

The Sun card could serve as a reminder to the querent to prioritize their own needs and to focus on their own happiness and well-being, in order to achieve success and fulfillment in other areas of their life.
