# To Win a Serious Legal Case

Found this spell in a book, I hold no credit for it, posted because it works.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'To Win a Serious Legal Case'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Voodoo doll

*   Clean white cloth

*   Obeah perfume oil

*   Vervain herb

*   White cotton thread

*   Myrrh incense

*   Frankincense

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Voodoo doll

*   Clean white cloth

*   Obeah perfume oil

*   Vervain herb

*   White cotton thread

*   Myrrh incense

*   Frankincense

Carefully place your Voodoo doll on a piece of clean white cloth and anoint with Obeah Perfume Oil. Then sprinkle with Vervain Herb and proceed to tie a white cotton thread around the doll's waist. Repeat the following : Here I tie an enemy of I, Who speaks of many, many lies. Silent, silent, he must be, While I win my case and am set free! Repeat this saying nine times for maximum effectiveness. Blend equal amounts of Myrrh Incense and Frankincense and proceed to burn. While this mixture smolders, read Psalm 7 nine times. Then wrap the doll in the white cloth and carefully in a dark secluded place. Conduct this special ritual on the night before the day you are to appear in court. Do it only after the sun goes down. When you have gone through all of the important steps, burn the doll and scatter the ashes in the night air. If burning is impractical, simply bury it away from your residence where it will not readily be found. As an added protection, carry a small piece of Chewing John Root when you go to court. Keep it in a convenient pocket where you can chew on it for luck.

I hope anybody who's getting screwed over by a legal system right now gets their victory.

This does appear to be a working spell, but if you are not initiated into Voodoo, I would not attempt it.
