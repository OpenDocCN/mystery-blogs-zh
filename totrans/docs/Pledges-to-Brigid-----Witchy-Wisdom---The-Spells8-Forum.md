# Pledges to Brigid üìö - Witchy Wisdom - The Spells8 Forum

In the days leading up to Imbolg, I am reminded of a tradition I once read about. Being new to Irish Paganism, I am really striving for authenticity. Brigid holds a special place in my heart and my daily life, so I thought it would be fitting to talk about this tradition. As always, keep in mind that this is not going to work for everyone and will not follow every path.

## Who is Brigid?

Brigid is a Goddess that is celebrated and honored at Imbolg. She plays a large role in many faiths and traditions, and mine is just the same. **She is a Goddess of the hearth, home, and inspiration**. As a Goddess well-connected to fire, She encompasses all things to do with poetry, healing, and smithcraft. However, She is also a protector of women and children and heavily associated with midwifery. You can read more about Her [here](http://www.roundthecauldron.com/brigid-irish-goddess).

## A pledge to Brigid‚Ä¶

I honestly cannot remember where I read - or heard - of this tradition. It could be something that came to me in a dream, for all I know. What I remember, though, is that on Imbolg, it is tradition to go to a Sacred Well and make a pledge to Brigid. This is not like becoming oathbound to a deity, nor is it pledging your life to Them. In this case, it is something you wish to do for the coming year - from Imbolg to Imbolg. **It is a pledge you make with Her that She will hold you to**.

## Imbolg Ritual and My Thoughts

I have never been one to do a full-blown ritual. I have never had the attention span, the memory, nor the space for such a thing. This year, though, **I believe that will be changing.** I will be making a pledge to Brigid - of what, I‚Äôm not sure. I think I will leave that up in the air until Imbolg rolls around. I will let the ritual, meditation, and trancework lead me to where I need to be. I will let Her show me the things I need to see. I will let Her lead me on the path that is best for me.

I plan on lighting my candles and performing meditation. I always like to use Dragon‚Äôs Blood incense because it eases my mind into a spiritual headspace. One that allows me to let go of my mundane thoughts and shift to magickal work. Flowers haven‚Äôt bloomed in my area yet - it‚Äôs still too cold - so those won‚Äôt be included on my altar. I plan on doing some meditative drawing - something I have never done before. I find it best to meditate when my hands are busy, though, and this task seems fitting. **When the time is right**, I will write my pledge to Her on a slip of paper and say it aloud. I will give thanks to Her for Her protection, poetry, and inspiration. I also feel that She is behind a lot of the courage I‚Äôve had since quitting my day job and moving toward freelancing.

She deserves my thanks, appreciation, and reverence - and She will have it.
