# Ultimate Anthropomorphic Animal Transformation

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This is the ultimate transformation to become a furry meerkat, arctic wolf, dragon, anything!

You can turn back into a human, but this isn't a ''shifter'' deal. You'll become a furry, and if you kinda hate it, you can turn back to your normal self.

Your goal in this spell is to tell the beings of the cosmos why you want to be an anthro. They should always get your message, but unless you have a good reason why you want to quit being 100% human and switch to 50% human.

You won't have gross mites exploding poop on your face if you're reptilian, you won't worry about not getting a boy/girl if you're canine, you don't need to fret about your awful voice if you're avian, you get to skip work and school all you want when you're feline, and if you want to be huggable, be a... horse! With so many different choices to choose from, it's almost impossible to choose your future for most people.

What should I write down if I wanted to become a cat anthro?

Nothing. You are human and will remain human.

Instead of dragon species, use cat for species and the type of cat you want to be for subspecies. Use the same things except for the plates and stuff like that, if your cat doesn't have spikes, get rid of it and continue on, just alter it a bit. That's what I did

You cannot physically transform into anything like NordStar said. However, Neko_wolfy6 makes an excellent point, you can always alter a spell to suit your needs. It would add a little personal touch and enhance the spell in a way.

That's a good point, Nekoshema. I can see your point on this matter, but i have to disagree. I personally feel that transformation spells are possible. I do have to agree with you that some of these spells don't work, but it wouldn't hurt to give it a try,wold it?

provided the spell isn't promoting physical harm to yourself or another living thing, correct, try it yourself and see if it works. people post to help, if you have doubts, try it and observe any results.

NordStar, dont say anythinf about it if you didn't even try it

You don't know if NordStar tried in this in the past or simply studied magick and learned through research magick cannot physically transform a human into a duck [or whatever nonsense you think it does] magick is a natural energy, that effects energy, to bring natural change. That's it. It doesn't contradict nature, or do the impossible. On the physical plane it is ruled by nature, that's just a fact.

Has anyone tried this yet I want to bea furry

You cannot physically transform, look into astral projection, mental shifting, or making a fur suit.

This spell works, I have tried it about 2 week s ago and instantly after 2 days ate more and now about 5-6 days later (I am not sick) but my whole body starts to get hot and a couple days before that I had strong compulsions to pet myself.

''instantly after 2 days''? you may wish to look up the definition of ''instantly''. what you have described isn't physical transformation [especially since this spell claims you become an animal, not hot and hungry] what you're describing are placebos. you want it to be real, so your mind has tricked your body into displaying ''symptoms'' so you can convince yourself it's real. magick on the physical doesn't contradict nature. if you wish to transform into an animal, look into astral projection as you can transform your astral body into anything you desire.

You cannot physically transform into anything.

You guys are crazy...

No, no...you are human 1wolfouta3\. And that is all you will ever be. You will never transform into any animal or anything to be exact.

The people speaking sense and teaching people how Real Magic works are the crazy ones? If you mean the people who believe they can transform, I do not think they are crazy, simply misguided and unaware.

Dude, there is so much tension here. I have tried this spell multiple times, but i'm still human.Though I do have a question. If your spirit was originally that of an animal's, like reincarnation and that, would it matter what spell you did to transform or shape-shift? Or will it not matter, because, as all of you say, your human? This question has popped up in my head multiple times and i just want to see if anybody knows the answer.

Physically, nothing would change. Transformation spells are to bring change into your life [say you want to stop a bad habit or become a ''whole new person'' large changes can be helped with a transformation spell or calling on werewolf energy] If you were an otherkin [human body, animal spirit] I suppose this spell could help to transform your astral or spiritual form [though from what I've been told by otherkin when they project, their astral form is of their spiritual form, not their physical one] You can also use a transformation spell as your meditating or going on a spiritual journey. That can, in theory, bring change to your spirit. The point most make and argue is the physical has limitations of nature. The spiritual is limitless.
