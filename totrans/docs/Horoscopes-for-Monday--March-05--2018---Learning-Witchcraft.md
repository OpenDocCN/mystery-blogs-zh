## Is Today Your Birthday?

You will see connections that other people have missed and that in turn will help you take advantage of openings and opportunities they don’t know exist. You will move faster and further over the next 12 months than you did over the previous 12 years.

### AQUARIUS

The doubts and fears of recent weeks are about to be swept away and you will realize that so many of the things you were worrying about were not worth the time or the energy. In future, be more positive. Control your mind, don’t let it control you.

### PISCES

Believe what you want to believe and ignore those who say you are mad, bad or dangerous to hold certain views. If they try to shout you down and prevent you from speaking don’t be afraid to shout back at them. They fear your ideas.

### ARIES

You must be able to back up any claims you make with facts that cannot be contested. If your rivals catch you out, even in minor ways, your reputation could suffer significant damage. Always make sure you know what you are talking about.

### TAURUS

What happens over the next 24 hours will force you to choose between a number of objectives that have been buzzing around inside your head. Choose a path and stick to it, no matter what others might say. Trust your instincts to guide you.

### GEMINI

Something you previously found perplexing will make perfect sense today. Once you have managed to get your head round the issue you will realize that the confusion was largely your own fault. Next time, see what is actually there, not what you want to see.

### CANCER

What happens over the next few days will make it abundantly clear that you need to think again about a situation that you thought had been written in stone. Don’t be afraid to admit you made a mistake and then go back to an earlier plan.

### LEO

It seems you don’t have much choice about what you are required to do, so get on and do it with a happy face and make the best possible job of it. Remember Leo, it’s not just about what you want, it’s about what other people want too.

### VIRGO

What you do for yourself this week will bring you much more enjoyment than what other people do for you. By creating something with your head and your hands you will remind certain people that you are more than just a pretty face.

### LIBRA

Do you avoid seeking a solution to a long-running problem in the hope that it will eventually resolve itself, or do you get your act together and do something decisive? You know the answer Libra, so stop skirting the issue and start fighting.

### SCORPIO

If you have been uncertain how to handle a tough situation that uncertainty should disappear quite quickly over the next few days. Looking back you will realize that you allowed yourself to be confused by listening to too many conflicting opinions.

### SAGITTARIUS

At some point this week you will realize that a routine you have grown used to is now way out of date and needs to be changed. If you stay in the past Sag you’ll get left in the past, so wise up and then get your act up to date.

### CAPRICORN

If there is something you have been thinking about starting without actually doing much about it there is still time to get on with it. But not much time. Resolve today to be more direct in your methods, then follow your instincts and act on them.
