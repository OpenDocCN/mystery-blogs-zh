# Witty and Bold with Demon Ipos

If you want to become a more successful person and live a better life, you must have a healthy amount of boldness. It is perhaps the most important trait you can have because it allows you to make use of opportunities that come your way or carve a path for yourself where there is none.Demon Ipos Can help you in that .

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Sea salt.

*   Four black or red candles.

*   Incense of wormwood and mugwort.

*   A cushion for sitting in a meditative posture (optional, if you are flexible enough to sit cross-legged on the floor without support you may do so instead).

*   A chalice filled with spring water or red wine.

*   A ceremonial dagger.

*   Your grimoire or diary (optional)

## Casting Instructions for 'Witty and Bold with Demon Ipos'

 **Setting Up:**

1.  Choose a location free from disturbances.
2.  Draw a circle with the sea salt.
3.  Set the four candles at each cardinal point within the circle.
4.  Place the cushion at the circle’s heart.
5.  Position the chalice and dagger beside the cushion.

**Ritual:**

1.  **Candle Lighting**: Ignite the candles, moving counter-clockwise from the east. Recognize each flame as an anchor to the ethereal plane.
2.  **Initiation of Meditation**: Find comfort on the cushion and shut your eyes. With every breath, move deeper into a rhythmic state of relaxation. The scent of the burning incense should guide your senses into a more profound trance, disconnecting you from physical constraints.
3.  **Invocation Chant**: Using the ceremonial dagger, symbolically etch the air with Ipos’s sigil, intoning: Ipos, essence of audacity and intellect, to thee I reach. Due to the complex design of the sigil, etch only the straight lines.
4.  **Meditation and Visualization**:
    *   **Realm Transition**: Envision yourself at the edge of a vast, obsidian-black abyss. This isn’t just any void; it’s the meeting point between your essence and that of Ipos. The sheer depth calls to you, inviting you to step forward.
    *   **Descent into the Abyss**: Imagine yourself slowly descending into this endless chasm, each level taking you further into the realm of Ipos. As you delve deeper, feel the darkness engulf you and listen for voices from within it.
    *   **Encounter with Ipos**: Sinking deeper into the abyss, visualize a magnificent fortress of shadow and flame. Herein dwells Ipos. As you approach, the spirit manifests — neither entirely beast nor human, but an amalgamation of forms that signify cunning and confidence. The creature, enveloped in an aura of vibrant energy, stands before you. Reach out and allow it to merge with you, feeling every facet of its essence — the audacity, the wit, the strength — intertwining with your spirit. This can be a pleasurable and intense process, allow it to unfold for as long as it takes.
    *   **Assumption of Power**: Now, visualize your merged form rising through the abyss, absorbing the surrounding energies. As you ascend, feel yourself transforming, with the newfound essence of Ipos empowering your very core.
5.  **Affirmation and Sealing**: Gently open your eyes, focusing on the chalice. As you sip the water (or wine), perceive it as a final act of merging, a ritualistic affirmation of the transformation you’ve undergone. The liquid is a pact, the bond that ensures Ipos’s essence is now a part of you.
6.  **Concluding the Ritual**: With a newfound sense of completeness, bring yourself back to the present. Extinguish the candles, moving clockwise from the east. If you’d like, document your journey, insights, and transformations within your grimoire.

**Note :**

For some practitioners this is a pleasurable invocation, while others have reported feeling a lot of anger and even a desire for revenge manifesting.

Although this is understandable because you will be looking back on your weaker self and its experiences from a place of newfound strength, I advise that you don’t act blindly and lash out at people.

Use your boldness and wit in a calm manner, control your strength and use it to your advantage. As mentioned earlier, you can perform this invocation ritual whenever you feel it is necessary.
