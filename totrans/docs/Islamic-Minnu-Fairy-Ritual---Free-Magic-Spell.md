Wow, I'm impressed, is the Minnu fairy really real?üôÇ

Different myth give them different name. I collected it from Indian local islamic tantra. So result may vary,it depends on your initiation from your master. If your master is islamic shabar tantra expert, you can get sollution.

As far as I am aware, there is no such thing as a Minnu Fairy. You also should not call on a fairy, offer it cloth and flowers and expect it to Grant you good luck. Cut flowers are seen as insulting as you killed something natural. As for cloth, it falls into the clothes and tools category which is a way to tell a fairy to leave your space and is seen as offensive. Just bake a fairy cake and set it outside.

An offering for The Fae. It can simply be a vanilla cake recipe with a few extra things The Fae enjoy. I make mine with oats and elderberry. Never make it with chocolate. Make the cakes, take the perfect ones, as any imperfections can be seen as an insult, and place them outside. Do not make a sweeping declaration when you do it. I normally go to the same space with a plate of them, I place them on a rock, take one, and walk away. It is perceived more like sharing and less like an offering.

Tadashi, why can't it be chocolate? Is there anything that makes it seem bad to Fae?

Fae seem to dislike anything that could do harm to the wildlife who they live among. If you are leaving an offering outside, do not put something out that an animal could eat and get sick. It will upset The Fae, because they will see it as deliberate and not accidental. If you have an altar inside, you could try giving chocolate, but I would go with milk chocolate or white chocolate over dark chocolate because of how sweet the chocolate is.
