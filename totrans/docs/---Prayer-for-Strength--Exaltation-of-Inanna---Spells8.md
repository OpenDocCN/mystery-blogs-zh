# ▶️ Prayer for Strength: Exaltation of Inanna – Spells8

> 来源：[https://spells8.com/inanna-goddess-prayer/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/inanna-goddess-prayer/#0001-01-01)

For the many peoples of ancient Mesopotamia such as Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians and Hittites, Inanna was the goddess **capable of creating life and who personified fertility**.

But she was a much more complex goddess and many more aspects are listed under her protection, such as that of **the warrior goddess**. The joint role of mother and warrior goddess was very widespread in the cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Hail to Inanna, goddess of love and procreation.
Queen of all given powers,
Unveiled clear light.

Unfailing woman wearing brilliance,
Cherished in heaven and earth.

Chosen, sanctified in heaven,
Grand in your adornments.
Crowned with your beloved goodness,
Rightfully you are High Priestess.

Your hands seize the seven fixed powers,
My queen of fundamental forces,
Guardian of essential cosmic sources.

Mistress of the scheme of order,
Great Queen of queens.
Babe of a holy womb,
Greater than the mother who bore you.

You all knowing,
You wise vision,
Lady of all lands,
Life-giver for the many.

Faithful Goddess,
Worthy of powers,
To sing your praise is exalted.

Let me feel your presence in me
So that I can feed myself with the strength I need.
Let me hear your voice through my heart,
To make the best decisions in difficult times.

You, my Goddess, who have power over all things,
Release me from any evil and renew my hopes every day.
I ask you for courage and resilience.
You are my fortress, my protective shield against adversity.

You of the bountiful heart,
You of the radiant heart,
I will sing of your cosmic powers.

You lift up the elements,
Bind them to your hands.
Gather in powers,
Press them to your breast.

You are Inanna.
Supreme in heaven and earth!
Praise Her who received the unchanging powers.

Praise my lady wrapped in beauty.
Praise be to Inanna!
