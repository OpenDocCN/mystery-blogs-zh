# Dolphin Transformation Spell

I had a conversation with Dolphine, the god of dolphins, and my spirit animal( also a dolphin) about how I could become a dolphin. They granted me the spell and it has worked for me at least 6 times.

> **"Dear Delphine, god of dolphins, I wish to become a dolphin. I wish to serve you for as long as I shall live. Fuse my legs together into a long, gray dolphin tail. Shrink my legs and arms into nothingness. Sprout me two sets of gills on the sides of my neck, turn me into a dolphin. Make my body grow two flippers and a beautiful shiny dorsal fin, transform me into a dolphin. Stretch my mouth into a snout, with rows of beautiful sharp teeth, transform me into a dolphin. I will forget everything about my human past and I will never regret being a dolphin. I will obey my master and always do as he says. I will be stuck as a dolphin forever and will never regret it. This is my wish, I ask of thee, this is my will, so more it be."**

After that you will start to transform into a dolphin shortly after you say the spell. You will be stuck as a dolphin forever and will always be a dolphin. Enjoy your new life as a dolphin! Message me your results.
