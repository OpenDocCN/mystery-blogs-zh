# Easily Changeable Enchantment Spell

This spell will help you enchant a particular object to fit your needs.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   NECESSARY:

*   Object to enchant (can be body part if you are daring. I used a hairclip)

*   Whatever of the optional items that you choose (see spell for more information.)

*   OPTIONAL/ CHOOSE:

*   Herbs, depending on need, see spell

*   Salt

*   Epsom Salt

*   Water/Liquid

*   Moonlight/Sunlight/Element based something

*   TIME NEEDED: Anywhere from five minutes to however long you choose.

## Casting Instructions for 'Easily Changeable Enchantment Spell'

 Take your object and charge it overnight/day. If you are charging it by the moon, leave it in direct moonlight or by your windowsill overnight. If you are charging it by the sun, do so over day. If you are charging it in dirt, fire products, water, air, or any other element based item, do so in whatever way you generally do, or immerse it in said item for as long as you wish. If you are using an appendage/body part, consider doing so during a bath or another related time.  Once your item is charged sufficiently (as per your wishes, but recommended to be nine hours/minutes/seconds) you may proceed onto the next part.

This next section is not necessary but it is recommended. Soak your item in a wash of salt and water, for at least nine seconds, but extend as long as you wish, and then pat dry with yourself or a towel or such. Then do the same with Epsom salts. When they are dry, hold it in your casting hand (whichever hand you feel is dominant in casting this spell) and meditate on your intentions. If you cannot do this because you have enchanted your body, then you must meditate but not hold the object. You many then proceed.

If you have particular herbs you wish to use, you should make a "tea" or something like that of them. A paste will also work. Consult the following list for correspondences (but know you do not need the corresponding herb(s) to make the spell work. Putting in whichever herbs you find work best for you also is encouraged.):

*   Money/Pecuniary Wishes: Mint
*   Romance/Amorous Wishes: Rosewater, Strawberries, Apple, Saffron (Can also enchant a lipstick if you wish)
*   Protection/ Protective Wishes: Cactus, Peppercorns, Thorns
*   Healing/ Health Wishes: Jade plant, Aloe Vera, Basil, Cardamom
*   Innocence/Innocent Wishes: Cucumber, Cactus, Cinnamon, Lemon
*   Beauty/ Beauty Wishes: Citruses (Orange, Lime, Lemon), Mint, Berries

You may use none of these or all of these if you are on the extreme ends but you can also choose to use whichever you prefer. Once completed, you may redo the "ritual" with the salts, but this time, do the reverse, putting Epsom salts before the table salts.

Keep this item close to you when you need the effects. If you can form a connection without it, do not worry about keeping it close by. Do not ingest any of the ingredients unless you know they are edible. Aloe Vera, many varieties of cactus, most thorns, and many herbs are not safe to ingest (at least in large quantities) and you could be gravely harmed. 

Blessed be!
