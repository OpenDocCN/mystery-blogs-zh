# The Elevator to Another World

Introduction:This is a ritual from Korea. By performing this ritual you are supposed to get to ''a different world.'' According to people that have successfully completed the game, it looks the same as the town/ building that you are from, but all the lights are off and you can only see a red cross in the distance. There are no other living things there except yourself. Some say electronics like phones, cameras, etc. don't work, while some say they do. Also, some say that getting back to the real world is harder for some reason.
You get disorientated and forget the elevator you came on, or somehow the elevator seems to get further and further away as you walk towards it.

This does not work. You cannot physically go to another realm. Moreover, this is not a Korean ritual, it is a silly game similar to Bloody Mary.

Not Korean, prob form Japan.

My point was not the origin of the ritual, but claiming it is a ritual in the first place. This is a game to scare kids similar to Bloody Mary. It is not a genuine ritual.

I was about to say isn't that one of the forbidden games like Bloody Mary?

I have heard of this before, I doubt it works though.
