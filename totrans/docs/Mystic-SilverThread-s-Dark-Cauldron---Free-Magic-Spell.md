# Mystic SilverThread's Dark Cauldron

Since I am an eclectic solitary witch, this spell is a mix of several systems that I practice.
This spell came to me after long debate over a ''problem'' that I HAD with another witch. The inspiration came from one of my dark Lwa and ever since, I have not had the problem again.
My cauldron is suspended (in a dark corner) under my working altar and above a dragon flame candle.
The purpose of this cauldron is to be a place of agony, pain, misery, torture and destruction for whoever the witch decides.
Once the cauldron is ready, all that would be needed is a ''link'' to the subject to be placed in the cauldron.
A link could be hair, nail clippings, bodily fluid, photograph or piece of paper with as much of the subject's information as possibly.
This can easily be customized by the witch as needed.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Mandrake Root

*   2 or more Loadstones

*   Devils Shoestring

*   Witch Hazel Bark

*   Valerian Root

*   Alligator Foot

*   Black Arts Incense

*   Hot Foot Powder

*   Goofer Dust *with brimstone

*   Graveyard Dirt *not collected properly

*   Black Salt

*   High John the Conqueror Root

*   Dead Black Widow Spider *preferably whole and not squashed, the worse the spiders death the better.

*   Dead Scorpion *preferably whole and with everything attached still.

*   Dead Bee(s) and/or Wasp(s) *preferably whole and not squashed and with everything still attached.

*   Whole Red Peppers

*   Black Pepper

*   Cayenne Pepper

*   *It should go without saying that the more fresh the dead animal is the better. I do not advocate killing the insects yourself but that will make the spell stronger.

## Casting Instructions for 'Mystic SilverThread's Dark Cauldron'

**This spell requires the Witch to be able to manipulate energy, be a freethinker and be able to create. Following another witches spell is not good and it's not recommended as your only mimicking another. A true witch will create, so use my spell as a guide but make it your own. Make it mean something to you.
****This cauldron, once completed, if done right should make the witch cringe a bit and that is the point. I am not saying you should be afraid of this... but it should, at the very least, make you nervous opening the lid. Not because of its ingredients but because of the purpose and its power!

I use a medium to large sized cauldron for this spell as I never know how many subjects will be in at the same time. You are free to use whatever you have on hand. Not all ingredients will be available to everyone and that is ok, Magick is mainly about the intent and not so much about the ingredients. The more of these ingredients you can get the better and if you only have a few for now and can order or wait for others later, then work with what you have and add as you go.

When you construct this spell, it is REAL IMPORTANT that you are mad, upset, angry and hurt. Now, it is also REALLY IMPORTANT that you separate those feelings from whoever or whatever was the cause. When you do this spell, you want only the negativity to go into the cauldron and not the person who caused it for you. The reason is that you will want this cauldron to work with more than one subject (if not, then disregard).

Each ingredient can be used for positive or negative, in this case, we want the negative for most ingredients. For some ingredients you want to use for force and/or power.As you place each item into the cauldron you want to transfer the energy into that item. You will want to have a cauldron full of anger, fear, poison, hatred and destruction. Once everything is all complete, you will want to consecrate the cauldron. Be creative and mean/feel what you say.

For me, I place a photo of the subject into the cauldron. The photo usually will have the name, date of birth and a sigil. *If you don't have a photo of the subject, be creative or message me for ideas.
Right before putting the subject into the cauldron, I find it helpful to think what they did that wronged me and decide how long I will keep them in the cauldron. I let the anger build up then I transfer the energy into the photo and place it into the cauldron and walk away.
*I like to come up with the length of time they will stay in the cauldron before I get angry that way it doesn't become a ridiculous amount of time. I don't use this spell on the folk who back talks me or trash talks me, my family or loved ones as I have other methods of Magick for them. This is for someone who has truly caused torment, harm, hurt, and pain (Examples would be: someone who raped you or a loved one, someone who tortures you, someone who tries to ruin your name or attack you).
(I encourage you to make this personal to you, if you need help with ideas I am more than willing to offer suggestions within reason so feel free to message me.)
