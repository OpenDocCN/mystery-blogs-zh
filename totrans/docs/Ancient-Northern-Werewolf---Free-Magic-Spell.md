does it work

No spell will make you physically transform. You are human and will remain so.

Well you won't transform physically but you could where a wolf skin and hypnotize your self into believing you're a wolf. And because perception is reality you would in fact become a wolf.

It will not work trust me I'm a werewolf you half to be bitten or born into

I wouldn't recommend it, not because you will become a werewolf but because with the coronavirus currently making its rounds it's probably the worst moment in history to ask a stranger to bite you. [once the pandemic is over, I still wouldn't have a person bite you because a human's mouth is a germ factory, also you can't become a werewolf]

It is believed that some Shaman are gifted the ability to shapeshift. This knowledge is passed onto them by an elder after the Shaman has proven themselves worthy of this honour. I am certain this is not it, and that this is fake. At best, you could use this in a ritual to connect with a wolf spirit, but you will not physically transform into a wolf.
