You should Give english meaning to the spell. Hu Li = Fox , Jing = Spirit .( don't get wrong, kitsune is not a bad horror fox, but the meaning is only Fox Spirit). Zhu= lord or owner or god , Miao (match in ''pinyin chart'') =temple or shrine (it means 'Goddess Fox spirit Temple'). but, because 1 chinese romanji could make many words with the 4+1 tones, there maybe Miao = clever or wonderful but the language should be 'Miao de Hu li Jing Zhu' which doesn't fit into words above so the meaning is once again (Goddess Fox Spirit Temple). Spell is Working, no problem, but you should really in contact with ''kitsune''. and part 'place on your altar' is important, also be respect with kitsune don't force her.
