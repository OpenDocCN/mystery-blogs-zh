# Painful Urinary Tract Infection

If someone has done you wrong and you want them to feel pain here is a simple working. This is done more easily for men, but if you can find a fresh pile of urine from a female that would be good also. This working is done to make a painful urinary tract infection. Letting this curse see the light of day will destroy it and you will have to start over, unless that was your intention. Once lifted, remove the soaked cloth or piece of toilet paper and bury it at a base of a tree and throw away the mousetrap. This curse wont go away automatically, but it will allow the wound to finally heal.
