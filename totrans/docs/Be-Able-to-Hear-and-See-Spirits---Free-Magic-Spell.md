**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Lavender flower/incense/scent

*   (For bad spirits) salt

 First, light the lavender insence, crush the lavender flower or spray the scent. Then on a flat surface, place the candles with the tall candle in the middle of the two small ones. If you are trying to reach bad spirits, now arm yourself with a cross and put salt around the candles.

Now take the tissue with your tears on it. Bunch it up and put it in the flame of the largest candle. Be careful. Take the pair of earrings or headphones and place them under the two small candles. Say the following chant:

"Spirits are around me each and everyday.
Their ghostly arms surround me and carry me away.
I know they are around me all the time.
I wish that I could hear them, see them.
So mote it be."

You may feel lighter after saying the chant. Shake it off and blow out the candles. This ability will only last for up to an hour at a time.

This spell is not going to work. Seeing or hearing spirits are abilities which need to be developed with practice. It is debated that one is born able to see spirits. I feel it can be developed and that spirits can choose whether to appear to someone. This spell isn't likely to work well. It offers no exercise to develop clairvoyance or clairaudience.
