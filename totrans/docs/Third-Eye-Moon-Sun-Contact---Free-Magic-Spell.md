 ## Casting Instructions for 'Third Eye Moon/Sun Contact'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Obviously, opened third eye.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Obviously, opened third eye.

First meditate on your third eye: keeping both eyes closed and focused on the third eye chakra_____for about 5 minutes.
(If for moon you must be under the moon light and If for sun you must be near a sun rise at morning)___optional]]
And so instead of the indigo coloured third eye, Imagine a white bright circle__moon°else imagine a bright fire ball___sun°________all for about 5 minutes or more as per choose.
Note: when you will stop this meditation you must imagine the third eye colour be brought to indigo again slowly.
