## Casting Instructions for 'Akasha's Purification Spell'

 So this spell does a few things and its considered a fire spell so it works pretty quickly. You should be able to find all herbs in your kitchen. The only thing you need to find are the candles. This spell will help you remove any negativity from you, your chakras, or your home. If you feel you have any type of curse or hex than this will remove it from you. After you or your home has been cleared than you will be able to welcome positive things in like love, happiness, prosperity, etc.

**Part 1**

First you want to get your piece of **paper** and write your name or the name of whoever the candle is for. Also include any words of power or symbols. *(If this is for your home you will be writing your address instead)* After you have prepared your **paper you will burn it** in something that can contain heat. You will be using half the ashes for the black candle and other half for the white candle. Now you will get your **black candle** and you will puncher 4 holes into your candle one right across from each other. *(These holes represent the four elements)* Make sure these holes are big enough to put herbs into. After you have made the holes you will add **half the ashes** from earlier to the holes and 1 or more of the **following herbs in any forum** :

*   **Black Pepper***   **Chili Pepper***   **Mugwort***   **Salt***   **Clove***   **Rosemary***   **Parsley***   **Pine***   **Basil***   **Sage**

After you have added any of these herbs you may seal the holes with candle wax if you would like. When you are finished take the candle in your hand yell out all the problems you want removed, with every problem slam the candle bottom onto a flat surface. *(Try not to break it)* Finally you'll want to light the candle at your altar or a safe place. The black of the candle represents the negativity, as it burns away it will leave you. *Note: Every black candle does something different depending on how much negativity maybe present. So it must be watched.*

**Part 2**

When the black candle is burned out, you will move on to the white candle. This is where you will fill the void with positive things to than bring positive things in your life/home. Whatever the candle has been kept in you will use for the next step. You must fill the jar/container with a generous amount of **sugar** , along with the rest of the ashes from earlier. Depending on what you would like to bring into your life will help you pick what herbs you would like to add to your sugar. ***Pick one or more of the following in any forum:***

**Love:**

*   Ginger*   Rosemary*   Rose*   Peppermint*   Dragon's Blood*   Lavender*   Cinnamon

**Happiness:**

*   Saffron*   Marjoram*   Cinnamon

**Protection:**

*   Rosemary*   Rose*   Dragon's Blood*   Mugwort*   Sage*   Basil*   Frankincense*   Sandalwood*   St. John's Wort

**Home Protection:**

*   Dragon's Blood*   Sage*   Salt*   Cumin *(Perfect to protect against theft)*

**Drawing:**

*   Lavender*   Bay Leaf

**Money:**

*   Ginger*   Cloves*   Pine*   Allspice

Add as many as you want to the sugar and than shake it up. You may even add my money powder or love powder to the sugar. Than you will put the **white candle** in the sugar and light the candle. As the candle melts it will seal the positive in.

You may keep it as a talisman or bury it after it has fulfilled it's purpose.

I have made and tested this on 3 people and 1 home. It has gotten all positive results.
