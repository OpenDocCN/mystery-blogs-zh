# Becca's Floating Necklace

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This spell is like the one from the vampire diaries and it makes a necklace float in mid air.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Becca's Floating Necklace'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** First thing you do is you lay the necklace down on a book and you stare at the necklace and focus on the necklace and then say this chant:

> **"Gods and goddessess witches one and witches all make this necklace float in mid air. So mote it be."**

And then the necklace should float in mid air right infront of you and say the chant over and over until it floats in mid air.

Note: I'm almost certain this has never worked for anyone. Seems like a harmless thing to have on here but honestly imagine you are a God or Godlike being and your being harassed by random people over and over again to waste your time just to have a necklace float. This if anything would probably make em less likely to help in anything else you do.

This does not work. To do this would defy gravity, which would defy nature, and as I've said on so many of your spells, Becca, Real Magic does not defy nature. This is fake.
