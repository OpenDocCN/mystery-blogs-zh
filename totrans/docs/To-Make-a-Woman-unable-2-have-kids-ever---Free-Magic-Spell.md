Okay this is just mean.

While I agree, I've been struggling to find a spell to cause my own permanent infertility, and this is the closest I've found to that so far...

Arouraboraa, magick is an extremely powerful friend (or ally, I suppose), but it can't go against the laws of our biology (unless you master Biokinesis, which can be extremely dangerous, especially in matters such as these. As with any other 'kinesis', it'll take time to master. A lot of time for this one) . You can cast illusions and glamour to change eye color, but they're nothing more then glamours, illusions that trick the minds of others. You can cast a spell to make yourself less sexually appealing to others, but you probably won't be able to cause permanent infertility or sterilization without the use of more mundane methods such as chemicals. Also, if you do find a sterilization spell that works, don't act foolishly. These spells, if they are real, will take up a lot of energy, and will probably take even more energy to reverse (an amount of energy that you may not even have) and could result in dire consequences. I'm not trying to discourage you, I'm just telling you to be smart and check what your motives are

This does not work. While some believe you can send enough negative energy towards a woman to have a miscarriage, this would take so much negative energy an individual would not be able to complete it. This spell specifically does not work because it would have to change your genetics. If a woman can have children, it would take more than a crystal and a chant to make the woman unable to have children. If you do not want children, there are many medical options available, and if they are too expensive, look into money spells.

This spell is ridiculous even if u did pull it of it would be a horrible thing to do.

This won't work. It could make her miscarry (which is a terrible thing to do to someone innocent), but it probably won't make her infertile or sterile. Probably, that is...
