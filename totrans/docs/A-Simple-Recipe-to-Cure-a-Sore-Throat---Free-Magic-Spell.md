**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Water

*   About 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of table salt

*   Yourself!

First pour the water into the cup, filling it about just over half way.

Then add the teaspoon of salt into the cup and mix well until the salt has dissolved completely.

Then gargle again and again as many times as you can until the cup is empty.

To make this stronger you could experiment with other ingredients or say a simple spell before drinking it.

Good luck and I hope you get better!
