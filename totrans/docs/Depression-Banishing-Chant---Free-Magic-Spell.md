"Blessed goddess of love and light
Please come help me on this night

My soul is sad I don't know what to do...

This lackluster feeling has no appeal
Help me see the love begin and
Feel my heart be light again,
Let me climb up from this hole,
And be with you heart, body, and soul.

I ask thee goddess on this night please
Help me make myself alright!
So mote it be!"

While there's nothing wrong with utilizing magick in recovery, if one is suffering from a mental health condition, they should not rely solely on magick. Professional help is needed when treating most mental illnesses.
