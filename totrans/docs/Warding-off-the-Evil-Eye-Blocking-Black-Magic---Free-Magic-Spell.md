And all the power found in me
As I will so mote it be.Â

''Black magick'' is not a proper term. Magik is intention, not colour. That said, this is a working protection spell. I just question burying the candle on your property. The candle can act as a ward it would be fine, but if it is meant to represent negativity, I would bury it off property.
