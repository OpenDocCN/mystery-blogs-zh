 Determine precisely what it is you want that someone to hear, or perhaps feel. Write down your wish on a piece of paper in a simple form. Make a dream pillow using a small square of fabric and a little batting. Throw in a pinch of lavender and rosemary. Put in the piece of paper last, then sew up the end. Put the dream pillow on your altar. Do an altar devotion to center yourself, then create sacred space. Center yourself, then hold your hands over the dream pillow and say the following:

'Holy Mother, Goddess Divine, I stand before your sacred shrine. This person won't listen or hear. My words tickle deafened ears. Holy Mother, Goddess Divine, send a dream to awaken their mind. Through his/her vision he/she lives the nightmare/passion/lesson he/she so freely gives. Holy Mother, Goddess Divine, send them your enchanted design. Clear out the cobwebs and tear down the walls. Carry my message up and down every hall".

For those who are also confused like me, batting is ''cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers in batts or sheets, used as filling for quilts or bedcovers.''
