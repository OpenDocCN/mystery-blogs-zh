 As you are performing the Spell, imagine yourself and what you want to look like… ex. Yourself without any skin imperfections, a nicer smile, etc. You can also imagine white magic/haze swirling around you, perfecting your appearance.

Set out your materials and light the candle (and incense). Take a few seconds or minutes to focus and calm your mind. Make sure to set the proper intention.

When you are ready, chant this Spell:

I am beautiful, inside and out

I am a youthful stream,

I am a moonlight beam

I am an emerald of the Earth,

I am the fire in the hearth

I am a rose bush,

Thorns and all

May the charm from within spout,

I am beautiful, inside and out

Blessed be

Blow out the candle.

At this point, you can wash your face with any water, though fresh, moon, or holy (whatever is holy in your craft) water is best.
