*   Passion flowers

*   Jasmine flowers

*   Rosemary

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Rose petals

*   Passion flowers

*   Jasmine flowers

*   Rosemary

*   Hibiscus petals

*   Dragon's Blood tree resin

*   Coconut (& citrus) oil

*   Lavender oil

*   A list of all the qualities in your Mr. Right

*   Pheromones (if you have any)

 As the cauldron or pot comes to a small boil, add the rose petals, passion flowers, and some jasmine flowers to it. Stir three times clockwise. Next, add a teaspoon of rosemary. Add some hibiscus petals. Then, add the Dragon's Blood and stir three times clockwise. Put in a few drops of both oils. Stir until the potion boils a little more. After that, add the list of qualities into the potion. Finally, add some pheromones and say the spell:

> The perfect man I summon now,
> 
> Another way I don't know how.
> 
> Bring him now into the light.
> 
> Somewhere out there is Mr. Right.

Mr. Right will come.

REMINDER: Mr. Right will only be around for 24 hours. After they have passed, he will leave. But you can summon him back as many times as you like.

NOTE: If you do not have any pheromones for the potion, ask a love deity to help you. They will give you what you need.

WARNING: Though you can summon Mr. Right back as many times as you like, keep in mind, you must only do so if you really need him. If you summon him back for personal gain, it will either not work or backfire.

To summon back Mr. Right

You will need three candles. (White, blue, red, or purple.) Place them in a circle. Light them and chant this spell:

> The perfect man I summon now,
> 
> Another way I don't know how.
> 
> Bring him now into the light,
> 
> Come back to me. Mr. Right.

Keep chanting until he appears.
