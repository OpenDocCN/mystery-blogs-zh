> 来源：[https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/contact_spells/18403/page.html#0001-01-01](https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/contact_spells/18403/page.html#0001-01-01)

**Charging the spell**

This spell was newly made, and is best done if charged.

Get out a piece of paper and write down the spell name, it's purpose, requirements, and incantation.

*Yes, you have to physically write down the whole spell. You can shorten it a little, as long as if it doesn't change the meaning, etc.*

Now, place your hand over the paper and imagine your energy running through your veins. Imagine putting that energy into the spell. Note: Don't use too much of your energy, save some for the spell. Also, imagine energy coming from mother nature (from plants, the ground, etc.) imagine it coming from the ground, going through your body, through your hand and into the paper. Imagine energy coming from the universe (imagine the sky, the stars, the clouds, etc) going down through the top of your head, through your body, through your hand and into the paper.

While or after you do this, (you can hold the paper if you want) still imagine the energy flowing into the paper and chant:

''Wind, fire, water, earth,

I call on you to make this spell magick

so mote it be.''

(Chant from: http://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/love_spells/en chanting_spells/17050/page.html )

You can make up your own chant as well if you'd like.

During this, you may feel coldness, warmth, tingling, etc.

After, you may get a headache. This is a sign you used too much of your own energy, or it was too much energy that you couldn't handle just yet.

Now, you are able to perform the spell.

**Performing the Spell**

Light candles (doesn't matter what color candles) The more candles, the better. And the bigger, the better.

On a inch or 2 inch (width and length) piece of paper, write the spirit or demons name.

If you didn't know their name, you can name them yourself, or name them jane doe, or john doe, and picture how they look and how their energy feels in your head.

Put your hands on the item used for the Ouija Board. (optional)

Now, Chant three times:

*''Shadows lurking in the night,*

I summon you,

come to us tonight.

**Consequences**

If you are planning to summon a *demon* just know that demons are known to induce fear, depression and suicidal thoughts. Do not do this spell if you do not have an emotional barrier.

If you are planning on summoning any spirit at all, be aware their may be consequences. Often, this spell is used for assistance, or for fun.

To make sure the spirit or demon leaves, you need to be emotionally healthy.

When you are done, tell the spirit to leave politely. If they do not leave, start yelling to leave. Order them to leave.

You do not need to physically talk for them to leave, you can say this in your head.

It may take them until the next day to leave.

**My results**

I made this spell with a friend because she wanted to talk to spirits. My house has always been haunted, but since I am emotionally healthy and without knowing, I tell spirits or demons to leave, spirits are never around me anymore. Unless, of course, I want them too. So, I did this spell on a demon I had for all my life. I named her Kelly. Anyway, the spell surprisingly worked well.

We did not used our fake Ouija Board to communicate with the spirit. Do, you can probably do the spell without one.
