Go outside and fetch a bowl full of water, hide it, write this on a blue piece of paper, in a blue pen: Dear Mermen of the kingdom of the fae. Make me a Merman. Make me a merman with a shiny gold tail. Powerful and wondrous Fae. Grant me my hearts desire to be a merman, with the powers of Hydrokinesis, Pyrokineses, Mind Control, Aerokinesis, Cryokinesis, Control anyones dreams, Shape shifting. With these powers I shall protect the ocean waters, the wonderful forces of Magick, and myself, from harm I can swim in human form without any training. Send me the beauty of a merman. There is a ring in the water, if I wear it I will grow a tail when I touch water, if I dont wear it I will not grow a tail after touching water. So grant me this new life, so I may love the water, instead of hating it, take this letter so I know this spell worked, take the water and leave the ring, thank you so much. From ______________________
Put it next to the bowl of water. Get your ring put it in the bowl of water. Make a pentagram out of paper, and put the bowl and everything else inside it. Read the letter out loud, 5X. Before you go to bed say: Mermen, mermen of the kingdom of the fae, give me my gold tail and powers of Hydrokinesis, Pyrokineses , Mind Control, Aerokinesis, Cryokinesis, Control anyones dreams, Shape shifting. For 5 nights, then when the paper, and water has disappeared, you know it has worked.

Fae are just another way to say fairy, and while some might include elves, gnomes, and mermaids into fae, it is not a world of mythological creatures. This does not transform you into a mermaid, Magic does not do physical transformations.
