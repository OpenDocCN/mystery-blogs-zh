**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Concentration

*   4 People

*   Pinecones Each

First all 4 of the people sit in a circle and hold a pinecone in the middle of each other touching. Next you must chant the following:

Gods of the fairies
I wish to become one of you
I will never harm any of your kind
I want my wings to be [ ]
And I want my powers to be [ ]
So mote it be.

Chant that 3 times together.
When you have done that throw the pinecones in the air... This can be in the day, at anytime but remember to be alone somewhere.
The side effects are two spots where the wings will grow, headache, nausea (where you feel like your going to be sick but you wont). Back ache :)

You can not become a fairy, regardless of belief.

for once in your life maybe you post a spell and see if you can do any better

Meaning what exactly? I have contributed spells to this site, as well as information to my coven members and other. Do you wish for me to post a working spell to turn you into a fairy? I cannot, because that is not how real Magic works. Perhaps you should do more research before attempting to call someone out in a subject you clearly know nothing about.
