*   -one black

Get your yarn(can be pipe cleaners or chord, but for the sake of the spell I am going to use yarn) lined up in front of you and pick up the color yarn at the time you say the color and twist or tie it to the others already said

Say:
Oh, (name of deity),
Hear my plea,
I put these colors together in harmony
White for truth and peace,
Red for the diving force, courage and fast action,
Light Blue for the wisdom and understanding,
Green for success and luck as well,
Yellow for the intelligence, learning and imagination,
Pink to make it all go down it peace,
Purple to unlock my hidden knowledge, power, and ambition,
Orange to help me adapt to anything that comes my way,
And black to bind it all together (at this time you wrap the black yarn around the others like a bundle)
By the power of three,
So mote it be

Then you can start your studying or whatever you are doing this to help you with. Make sure you keep your bundle next to you when you are doing this, or it won't work. When you are done with the spell, make sure you thank the deity you used above for their help so they will continue to help you in the future. Thanks so much for reading this, please tell me if this works for you. It did for me but I want to know your experiences with it.
