So, you think you’ve been hexed. What should you do?

 First, don’t panic! Hexes are not necessarily as scary as they seem, and there are ways to remove them.

 Here are the basics of hex removal:

 *   Know what it is and what symptoms to look for.
*   Don’t try to remove it yourself if you don’t know what you’re doing.
*   Seek help from a professional if you are uncomfortable doing it yourself.
*   Be patient; it may take time for the hex to be removed completely.

## Introduction: What Is a Hex?

You might be wondering, “What on earth is a hex?”

A hex is a type of curse that’s been placed on someone with the intent to cause harm. It can be something as simple as wishing someone bad luck, or as malicious as putting a death curse on them.

 And unfortunately, hexes are real. They’re a very real form of dark magic that can have some pretty serious consequences. If you think you might be hexed, it’s important to take action and remove the curse as soon as possible.

 No Wiccan should ever be casting a hex. It is my philosophy that any negative magic should be avoided at all costs, not just because of the [three-fold rule](https://craftofwicca.com/what-is-wiccan-law-the-wiccan-rede-explained/), but because the foundation of Wicca is to be in harmony with nature.

 But dark magic does exist, so it is possible someone has hexed you. You’re now in need of a hex removal spell or ritual.

 ## Signs That You Have Been Hexed

Here are some signs that a curse has been placed on you.

### 1\. A Sudden and Intense Draw to Protective Sources

Your body will always send you signs if something is wrong. This is especially true if you’ve embarked on the Wiccan path and have started to open up your spiritual channels.

 If you find yourself constantly reading about [protection spells](https://craftofwicca.com/protection-spells-for-loved-ones/) or find a deep urge to carry a lucky charm or talisman, then this could be a sign that you need it.

 ### 2\. Divination

If you’re more advanced on your journey, then you could use divination to find out if you’ve been hexed. This could be from a tarot reading or any other source you feel comfortable with.

Pay attention to subtler negative signs as well.

### 3\. Negative Signs

These negative signs can take any form. For instance, you may come across a dead animal every time you go out for a walk.

 This was a key sign to me the one time I got hexed. I walk the dog every morning, and I kept changing where I would do it because of encountering a dead squirrel or chipmunk.

 After the third time, I finally realized it was a sign that negativity was following me.

Keep an eye out for these sorts of negative signs.

 ### 4\. You Think of a Person a Lot

Every spell leaves its traces.

If you find yourself constantly thinking about someone and it isn’t in a good way (falling in love or something), then this is a sign that something about that person has been marked upon you.

 This is a very common sign that this person has cast a hex or other spell on you and it’s time to think about hex removal.

 Now, before you go running off to find a witch to cast a spell on your behalf, there are some things you should know.

 First of all, most hexes are not as powerful as you might think. And second of all, hex removal is not as difficult as you might think.

## Seeking Professional Help

It’s best to seek professional help if you are uncomfortable casting simple spells yourself.

 There are a lot of scams out there, and you don’t want to end up wasting your money on someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing. A qualified hex removal practitioner will be able to help you get rid of the curse and restore balance to your life.

If you don’t want to spend money and you want to be sure the person is legitimate, you can seek out a friend or family member who has experience with Wicca. There are many of us out there, and we’d be glad to help if it is for a good cause (and hex removal definitely counts!).

 Be prepared: this can take some time. Hexes are powerful spells, and they can take a lot of energy to remove. You may have to make some changes in your life, and it’s likely that you’ll see some negative side effects along the way.

 But don’t worry, with the help of a qualified practitioner, you can overcome anything.

## Hex Removal Methods

There are plenty of ways to remove a hex.

### Step 1: Figure out where the hex is coming from.

This might require some detective work, but it’s important to identify the source so that you can take appropriate action.

 As discussed above, there are traces of the person within the hex.

 You can try simple methods like meditating on the negative feeling coming from the hex and see if a person spontaneously comes to mind.

You should be sure when it happens, because the feeling will be very strong.

 Other methods are to just pay attention to if anyone you know is acting weird around you or paying extra attention. Maybe they ask strange questions to see if you’ve been having a hard time.

You can always resort to divination if those aren’t working.

### Step 2: Perform a Cleansing Ritual

From there, you can choose from any number of methods for hex removal.

 Start with a cleansing ritual.

You can use sage, salt, or sugar to clear the bad energy from your home or space. Or you can perform a cleansing ritual using specific herbs and prayers that speak to you. There are many on this site and others.

The key is to make sure you’ve purified the area for the hex removal spell, otherwise, you could contaminate the attempt at removal.

 ### Step 3: Perform the Spell

There are many spells and rituals that you can do yourself, or you can hire a professional hex-removal practitioner to help you.

The bottom line is that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to hex removal. What works for one person might not work for another. So it’s important to experiment until you find what works best for you.

Here is a simple starting point if you wish to do it on your own.

 The idea of the spell is to draw the hex out of you and into a different source.

Light two candles: one white and one black. These represent the shift from black magic to white magic.

Take a piece of crystal quartz into your hands and clear your mind.

 Feel the negativity from the hex within you. You absolutely must locate the hex before proceeding.

Now push those feelings into the quartz as you say:

> I ask you Mother Goddess
> To aid in this act of purity
> 
> Take the hex upon me
> And draw it to obscurity
> 
> Bound in quartz
> I banish the curse
> 
> No longer harmful
> I let it disperse

Continue to feel the hex flow into the quartz until you sense that it is completely gone.

 Do not hold onto the quartz for more than 24 hours. You must bury it as far away from yourself as you can. Over time it will be drawn into the earth and returned to nature as harmless energy.

## Protection Against Future Hexes

If you’ve been hexed and you want to protect yourself from future hexes, there are a few things you can do.

 First, you must ensure you’re not leaving yourself open to attack. Make sure your energy is strong and your boundaries are solid. Stay positive and focused on your goals.

 Second, you can use protective symbols and amulets to ward off hexes. There are all sorts of different symbols that can be used, and you can find them in books or online. Choose the symbols that feel right for you, and carry them with you wherever you go.

Last, but not least, it’s important to have a good support system. Make sure you have friends or family members who you can turn to when things get tough. When we’re under attack, it’s important to have people who we can rely on to help us through it.

 It’s not fun to think about, but remember that someone with the knowledge and power to curse you has already succeeded in it once. It is very likely they will notice that you removed the hex and will attempt again.

 Please stay safe. Protective amulets take very little time to make and can be a great source of protection.
