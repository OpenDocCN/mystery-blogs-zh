With the growth of the internet, it has become easier than ever to access witchcraft resources and tutorials, and many people who are interested in the craft have found that learning witchcraft online is a great way to get started.

## The History of Learning Witchcraft

Witchcraft is a complex practice that goes beyond just books and websites – it is a spiritual practice that requires personal experience and practice to truly understand and master. Throughout the history, Witchcraft practice was predominately passed on from generation to generation, mostly through oral traditions, including family history, agricultural skills, local myths and tales, as this was a result of the demographic and the type of people who would be interested in Witchcraft.

> Throughout history, every single culture does have a roots in shamanic foundation. Magicians, witches, shamans or medicine man and woman been part of every single developing nation and would play major role in its cultural and social development.

### Is it Any Different Today?

Well, yes and no. Yes, because technology has allowed us to learn from other witches around the world and because we're not land-locked to a local village or a specific region. This allows for completely new types of spells and magick to be created as a result of the **Internet becoming a large melting pot of various magical traditions and cultures**. And no, because the Internet, and social media in particular, has allowed the experience to be much closer to the original idea of a community, which shares ideas and experiences, and which, for example, goes beyond simply reading a book about the craft on one's own.

> With a traditional witch school, there is often a set schedule and curriculum that must be followed. With an online course, students can work as quickly or as slowly as they want, allowing them to focus on the parts of witchcraft that interest them the most.

### But how about all the technology?

We have technology, internet and new way how to connect with people who are like us and interested in the same things.

Witches always went with the flow of the seasons and nature. As people are moving more towards the Internet than learning in real life, it's only natural that online learning is the new direction that we are developing in. So, we can still learn through oral tradition and have the private experience of learning with others what does it mean to be a magician or a witch, the only thing that changed is **how the information or the experience is delivered to us.**

Online courses are also beneficial for those who want to learn witchcraft but **don't have the time or money to attend a traditional witch school**. Online courses are often much less expensive than traditional witch schools, and they can be taken from the comfort of your own home. This can be a great way to start learning the craft **without having to take time off from work or other commitments**.

#### We have now more freedom than ever to chose, the right witch community, witch school or online course, one to fit our own needs, believes and life style.

Online courses often offer **more of a community element** than traditional witch schools or by simply reading a book.

> There are often forums or discussion boards where students can ask questions, share experiences, and interact with each other. This can be a great way to connect with other practitioners and learn from their expertise.

For these reasons, online courses can be a great way to learn witchcraft. Whether you are just getting started or looking to broaden your knowledge, an online course can provide a great introduction to the craft.
