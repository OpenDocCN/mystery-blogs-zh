## How to Make Moon Water

You can make a moon water elixir in a few simple steps. Start with a bowl of water, preferably water that’s been sitting out for a few days, or water that’s been exposed to sunlight. If you’re using water that’s been exposed to sunlight, make sure it’s filtered and not just direct sunlight. Let the water sit and charge in the light of the full moon. If you want to use the water to make a full moon elixir, let it sit until the next day. If you want to make a new moons elixir, let the water sit in the sunlight until the next day, giving the energy of the new moon enough time to charge the water. Once the water has been charged by the light of the moon, you can use it to make moon water for magical purposes.

> **Moon water** can be used as a powerful tool for **divination and scrying**, by focusing your intention on the water and allowing yourself to be open to any messages that come through. To do this, you can fill a bowl with moon water and meditate in front of it until images, symbols, or messages come to you.

## Collecting Moon Water

There are a couple of rituals you can perform to collect moon water. You can collect dew from the grass on the night of the full moon to make a potent moon water elixir. You can also collect rainwater or water from a river on the night of the full moon. If you do collect water from the river, make sure it’s water from inland and not seawater. You don’t want to let the water sit out and collect impurities. Instead, collect it in a jar and then boil it in the jar.

## Using Moon Water in Rituals

1\. **Charging Ritual Objects:** Moon water is often used to charge ritual objects, such as crystals and talismans. Simply fill a bowl or other container with moon water and place the object inside. Leave it to soak overnight and then remove it the next day. As the object soaks in the moon water, it will absorb its energy and become more powerful.

2. **Blessing Rituals**: Moon water can also be used to bless rituals. To do this, pour some moon water into a bowl and wave your hands over it. Visualize the energy of the moon filling the water and then speak a blessing over it. You can then use the blessed water to bless any rituals or spells that you perform.
