## The Art of Placement (or “Honey, where’s the Couch”?)

Feng shui, or the art of placement, has existed for approximately 4,000 years, having originated in China. By its very design, Feng Shui works with an environment’s energy (called chi) and gently shifts that energy toward specific goals and overall improvements. As a person, or whole family, learns how to work with chi (instead of against it), the result is a greater abundance of happiness, well-being, and yes even money!

### Magic or Philosophy

When you read about Feng Shui there is no question that it has strong spiritual undertones. But it is also a philisophical system. To use Feng Shui effectively for improving money matters, first you have to understand the basics. Feng Shui breaks out every area (be it a whole building, a house, or a room) by its directional points. Within each directional point lies a specific type of energy that helps you understand more about how you habitually handle money, and how to fix that.

## Feng Shui Cardinal Directions

Let’s take a look in all four directions and see what Feng Shui has to tell us.

### North:

The northern part of your home or workplace nurtures finances, assists in job-seeking, wrangles head-on office politics, affects the way others perceive your work (putting it in a better light), and assits in career-oriented magick. Make sure there is a touch of black or blue in this region to support that energy flow, along with something gold-toned (perhaps a flowering plant with a gold-colored pot).

If the northern part of your home is a bathroom, you might find your career isn’t doing well, or that you’ve chosen a job as a plumber! If the northern part of your home is a den, you may find that a career in research, counseling, or something else quiet is the key to prosperity. In any case, this is one of the best areas in which to balance your checkbook.

### Northeast:

The northeast region empowers your ability to learn new skills for a job, or better apply and augment those you already have. Akin to the Eastern Quarter in magick, a lot of conscious focus comes from the chi here. When you need your mind and eyes sharp, work magic in this area and decorate it with yellows or browns.

If the northeast part of your home is a bedroom, you’ll be tempted to study for your job in this space; this may or may not work out very well. If the northeast part of your home is the kitchen, you probably find yourself hungry every time you apply your professional skills. No matter what, this is one of the best spots to choose for meditating on the “next steps” to take on the path to prosperity.

### East:

The eastern region supports for new financial endeavors and creative money applications. For example, if you’re trying to come up with a fresh marketing gimmick, cast your spell and do your groundwork here. East is also the best space for getting things moving toward steady improvements with money-or anything else. The accent colors for this region are pale blue and shoot green.

When a money-making proposition is buried in red tape or taking way too much time, check this part of your work- and living space. Clean up any clutter and remove barriers so the energy flows freely. By the way, if the eastern part of your home is a doorway, you may find opportunity knocking quite a bit. Just take care in that not all openings are right for you, nor will all be fruitful.

### Southeast:

This is the area from which your prosperity, and that for all members of your household, flows, so tend it with care. For improved overall abundance, make sure there are highlights of dark blue and green in this region, as well as something wooden like a business card holder.

If you want your money to grow, keep a healthy plant in this part of your home or office (or both!). If creative ability toward new financial opportunities seems sluggish, spend a lot of time in this region considering your options. If this part of the home is unkempt, you may make some gains that have “shady” overtones. Any house that has a “home office” in this region is likely to see reasonable success.

### South:

For money that comes from personal renown or the recognition of your abilities and efforts, work within this part of your sacred space or home regularly. Just remember that fame and fortune can burn like the fires from the South, destroying or creating in the process of manifestation. Decorate this region with reds and purples for the best results.

### Southwest:

The prosperity in this section comes from your relationships: having a successful mate, a helpful friend or a wealthy family member, for example. It is also the best spot for casting spells or enacting rituals for personal luck, peace, de-stressing, and contentment. To keep this energy moving, highlight this region with browns and yellows.

When you have trouble adjusting to financial changes, specifically those that affect your family harmony, review this space and give it loving attention. Make sure things aren’t blocky; stress curves (no sharp angles) for greatest effect.

### West:

When the children in and around your life need financial help, this is the area in which to be working your magick. Bring white, silver, or gold items into this space to accentuate its energies. Note that the results from this working will be aimed at helping the children help themselves.

By the way, this area can relate to figurative “children” too, such as a writer’s book, an artist’s painting, and a social worker’s successful charity!

### Northwest:

This is the charity and service-oriented part of a home. In other words, you get from giving. Work magick for other people here, especially spells and rituals from which you will get no reward but the satisfaction of knowing you’re doing something nice.

Additionally, you can enact spiritual processes here when you need financial help from others. When you do, the chi’s giving nature moves out of this space to open hearts and pocketbooks, even those of stern financial managers and loan officers! It also helps you overcome the natural discomfort felt when asking for assistance.

## Color Me Prosperous

As you saw with the directions, Feng Shui integrates color into its processes to help move energy in the direction desired. To use this additional dimension, you can light an appropriately colored candle in the segment of the house that best represents your financial goals, bring in a bouquet of flowers,or add small color accents by following this color chart:

### Black:

Clarity about your money and how it should be used. Finding sound ways to stay “in the black.”

### Blue:

Creative applications for money that result in happiness and wealth; double the effect by using this colore in the Northern Quarter of your home.

### Gold:

A very wealthy color that, when combined with the Southern Quarter of the home, encourages good health, too.

### Green:

Add this into your wardrobe and your home when you need improved business prospects, before making important business decisions or when applying yourself tenaciously to a work-related situation.

### Indigo:

Use this color to see the truth about a suspicious financial deal. It also helps you plan ahead for various projects that require a strong financial base. Most effective when combined with the Northeast Quarter.

### Orange:

Improved awareness of the best possible timing for financial matters, using money wisely and being dependable about financial obligations. Add to the Southwest Quarter to increase this color’s power.

### Purple:

Use this to loosen the purse strings a little, or when taking the financial role of leadership. Good overall color for abundance, especially when combined with the Northwest Quarter.

### Red:

An excellent color for making shrewd financial moves, especially quick ones, that result in long-term happiness and security. Combine this with the Southern Quarter of the home.

### Pink:

When you have to communicate about money in a tactful, gentle, and honest manner, pink is a great helpmate. Combine this with the Southern Quarter for improved impact.

### Yellow:

For situations that require a mature, responsible outlook with regard to your budget or other financial matters, turn to yellow. This color improves mental keenness and effective comomunications about money. It may also be combined with general wish magick for speedy manifestation. Most powerful in the Southwest Quarter of the living space.

### White:

When something stands between you and financial success, choose white to break down those barriers. This can also help you make money from travel, protects what you already have and breaks old cycles. Best combined with the Western Quarter.

## Elementary My Dear

Beyond using specific locations and colors to improve the flow of chi, Feng Shui advocates adding specific Elements into the living space. For example, the East and Southeast center of your home houses the Wood Element. If this area happens to be filled with metal, you might find that you spend a lot of unnecessary money on technological items. Replace some of the metal with wooden items, bringing the room back into balance along with your budget. If you can’t add actual wood to this space, use green-colored items instead.

Too much wood leaves you feeling very torn between your goals and dreams and concrete reality, especially in how you apply your paycheck. Money often comes and goesy in this kind of environment. Balance out Wood with a little Earth for foundations or some metal to provide a logical symmetry.

Here is a list of the four other Elements and their effects:

### Fire:

Fire is the Element for the Southern part of the living space. If this part of your home is dark all the time, you will never make money by being recognized for your talents. Open up the space to natural light. If you don’t have a way of improving the light in this area of your home, add accent items colored red or purple (or perhaps an ever-burning candle).

If this part of your home is overly bright, you might find yourself burning out in your chosen career, that you’re overly temperamental at the office or that your money seems to disappear as if you’d simply tossed it on a fire. In this case, you want to decrease the amount of Fire in the Southern part of your space by bring a little Water into the equation.

### Water:

Water sits in the Northern Quarter of a room or home, and it’s one of the best Elements for your career. When things are lagging, get yourself a fountain or fish tank and place it near this region. Another office-oriented option would be a water cooler! Alternatively, add accents of blue and black.

When there’s too much of the Water Element in the North, your career path may become unclear. You may also discover you lack a strong backbone. Balance out the Water by adding some Wood or Fire to those areas.

### Metal:

The next Element is Metal, and it resides in the West and Northwest. Decrease lost time at work due to sickness or get reliable assistance on a pressing financial matter, by adding more Metal into those parts of your office or home. The colors for Metal are white, silver, and gold.

When there’s too much Metal in the West or Northwest, you’ll often find you’re spending way too much on any metallic items (toasters, cars, and so on) or that you’re overly focused on the material world. Too much Metal in the West specifically means your children are costing you a lot of money. Earth and Water both help balance out too much Metal in one’s proverbial energy diet.

### Earth:

The Earth Element governs the Southwest and Northeast areas. When your chosen career seems in a constant state of flux, when depression affects your performance or when you find you’re having trouble applying yourself successfully to a new task, this Element is lacking. Try adding a potted plant or the colors of brown, yellow, and tan to these regions to resolve the problem.

When there’s too much Earth in your environment, you’ll focus on finances way too much, to the point of overlooking the obvious. You may also have a hard time switching gears from the mundane when trying to relate to spiritual matters. Balance Earth with Wood or a bit of Fire.

### Center

Not exactly a direction or an element, the center of a space represents neutrality and redirection. This is a wholly neutral zone. It is an excellent area in which to work on remaining simillarly neutral about difficult financial decisions or situations.

## Results Count

What kind of results might you expect from Feng Shui? If you’ re looking for a lot of bells and whistles, this isn’t the best system for you. Feng Shui has a very gentle motion. It’s not meant for dramatic transformation, but rather slow, steady change that works with nature and the space you have.

Additionally, Feng Shui stresses that a person must change as much as his or her environment to experience any degree of success. You must be ready for abundant living, and be equally ready to accept the necessary transformations that go with it. The gradual alterations that Feng Shui makes externally gives you plenty of internal preparation. Indeed, this is the perfect balance of the phrase “as within, so without “on a very personal level, a level that will lead you toward prosperity.
