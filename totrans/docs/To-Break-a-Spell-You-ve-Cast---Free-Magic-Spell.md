 Incantation: "I cast a spell asking , I now ask the favor of having the spell removed. I understand to take back a spell means giving up something of my own to show my spirit is true and my intentions are good. I give this pearl/bead from a necklace I own. I transfer the spell into the and render the spell dormant. No harm may come from the cancelation of this spell. No further power shall it have. This is my will - so mote it be."

Place the pearl/bead in the black cloth - add your angelica herbs. Tie the cloth up tightly with the string, wrapping the pearl/bead in the cloth. Dribble a bit of wax from the candles on the knot you tie. Then throw the small package away, far from your home. Close the circle and give thanks.
