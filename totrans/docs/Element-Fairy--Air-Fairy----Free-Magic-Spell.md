NOTE:
This Spell should ONLY be made on Friday. If it's not, it will not work.

You need to do this Spell in a quiet room alone. Take the balloon and pump it up. Then put it in front of you, close your eyes and recite the Spell:

'Goddess of Wind, Goddess of Air, please help me with my desire.
I wish to be an Air Fairy!
I wish my wings will be (white, blue, purple, grey).
I wish to have the powers of Wind and (healing, mind-reading, super-strength, super-speed)
When I say ''I am an Air Fairy'', I will be visible ONLY to the ones I have told my secret and I will have my wings on my back.
When I say ''I am a human being'', I will be a human again.
I promise to keep this a secret and only tell my Bestest of Friends and my family.
So mote it be!'

After you have recited the Spell, open your eyes and pretend to be using your powers and wings. Then close your eyes again, and do the same, but this time imagine it. At last, open your eyes once more and pop the balloon.
