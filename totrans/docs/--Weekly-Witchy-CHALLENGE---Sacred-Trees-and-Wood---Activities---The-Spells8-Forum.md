In looking through many books and sites, I came to the conclusion that this subject is so extensive that it would take months, no, years to do even a miner justice to it.

Wood has been used for millennia in magic, ceremony, perfumes, and incenses, tools, that‚Äôs just to name a few. Then you have to look at how essential it has been in activities of daily living. I‚Äôm talking about tools to make our lives easier, plows, carpentry, utensils and buildings for stock and humans. As man evolved, wood was often a life saver, think fire for warmth, light to ward off wild animals. These trees and their magical uses are a very small list of woods, there were/are too many uses to actually acknowledge in this paper.

Many of the magical properties of trees are the same, including: healing, love, and protection. This is because trees have been used for thousands of years as food and medicine, as well as for shade and shelter.

I don‚Äôt know if this is an acceptable submission but I hope others can use the information in their practice.
