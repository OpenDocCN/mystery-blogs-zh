## Casting Instructions for 'Increase Spiritual Awareness'

 On your altar, or your quiet and sacred place, take three deep breaths of air
and begin to ground and center yourself. Light the altar candle and
sandlewood incense.
Ask the Lord and Lady to bless this spell with the highest good of all. Gently
sprinkle the purple candle with some of the spring water, repeating:

> **"I cleanse thee, oh ye magical tool in the name of the Lord and Lady,
> removing all negative and disharmonious energies casting them out into the
> ethers."**

Now, move the purple candle over the sandlewood incense repeating:

> **"I consecrate oh ye magickal tool in the name of the Lord and Lady, removing
> all negative and disharmonious energies casting them out into the ethers."**

 Take the anointing oil in one hand and the purple candle in the other.
Starting at the mid-point of the purple candle, moving UP in a deosile
clockwise and circular motion, anoint the candle and repeat three times:

> **"I anoint you in the name of the Lord and Lady as a magickal tool to be used
> in the aiding of my magick.
>   I charge ye to increase my spiritual awareness that Love is the Key! Love
> is the Law!"**

 Now, starting at the mid-point again, moving DOWN in a deosile and circular
motion, anoint the candle and repeat three times again:

> ** "I anoint you in the name of the Lord and Lady as a magickal tool to be used
> in the aiding of my magick.
>   I charge ye to increase my spiritual awareness that Love is the Key! Love
> is the Law!"**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Option: If you wish you may draw the appropriate rune symbols on the candle.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lastly, repeat: *** As my will, so divine will be done. So mote it be!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spend of few moments quietly reflecting on the magick. Thank the Lord and Lady
for their presence in your life. Use a candle snuffer to extinquish only the
altar fire candle. Place the purple candle in a safe place as to not be
disturbed. Allow it burn out completely. Every time you notice the purple
candle burning, repeat quietly to yourself, LOVE is the Key! LOVE is the LAW!

amazing spell, i love how simple it is. whenever i light the candle it puts me in a spiritual mindset [i usually light it when i mediate or journal] even when i'm neglecting my spiritual practice, seeing that candle gets me motivated to start again.

This is indeed a very good informative spell, so why not place this spell in top-rated? and also give a picture? , its part ''lord and lady'' reminds me that in old elder pantheon there always power of male and power of female both equal, even ''queen of heaven, ishtar'' there are also queen and king in heaven.
