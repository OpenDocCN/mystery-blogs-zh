 Light all the candles around a bed. Burn the incense near you. It needs to be pure dark in the room. Lay on the bed, and chant:

"I feel fur immensely.
I become Inspired.
I don't give up.
Believe.
As I say, dear moon, belief is key.
The moon draws its light from the energy within.
I draw my energy from the wolf within.
Come wolf spirit! Come Great Unknown!
From the home of the wolf, the massive hill of bones!"

Imagine your body shifting into a wolf. Then say:

"Humans fear the beast within the wolf,
Because they do not understand
The beast within themselves."

Feel yourself shifting more and more. This just helps with shifting.
