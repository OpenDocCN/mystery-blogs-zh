## Casting Instructions for 'The Gift Of Diana: Letting Go of Past Sorrow'

 Altar: Arrange the flowers, candles and censer with the seven candles in a "half diamond" pattern, the point of the half diamond toward the back of the altar. Everything else goes to the side of the altar.

On a night when the moon is waning, to be followed up the next morning.
In the candle-lighting section you need to participate in and respond to the Goddess's commands, participating in the inner work that is required. This is an in-depth process that is between the Goddess and you. Be patient with your part of the process.

Body of Ritual: Place a little incense on a lit censer coal. Wait for the smoke to rise, then say:

"Lady, many have been my sorrows;
Innocent gifts of love,
And gardens of paradise,
Battered and crushed at other's hands.

A hand held out in trust,
The shattered illusion of perfect human love,
These are the dark pools of memory
About which I pray".

Sprinkle more incense on the coal, then say:

"I have done what I can,
To write, to talk, to speak the truth.
I have done what I can,
To banish the pain from my mind.
But still I am injured
And the pain still rises in my memory.
I am in need of one more powerful than I,
And so I pray, Diana, come and heal my soul"

Sprinkle more incense on the coal, then say:

"O Queen of Earth and Heaven,
Mistress of hope and courage,
Lady of magic that heals and mends,
Hear my prayer.
Help me to release these past sorrows.
It is my desire to give up my burden.
And so I pray, Diana, come and heal my soul".

Sprinkle more incense on the coal, then say:

"Lady; even in the shadow does hope ascend.
For you now stand before me.
Your prism-colored light seeps into my soul
As you urge me to step out from my aging armor.
Speak to me, O Lady who is Goddess of all things".

Hear Her words, allow them to enter your heart as She speaks:

"I, Diana, carry within My Divinity,
The scales of justice
And the sword of change.
Listen to My words and
I will bring you healing and peace.

Let My commands travel deeply into your soul,
And light will enter into darkness.
For I am the dawn, the Mother of Morning Light,
And I will renew your soul.
In love and power I say
Be brave, and prepare for change,
Knowing that the shadow's time is at an end."

Say: "Hail Diana" and bow your head. In the next part of this rite, respond to Her commands. Take as much time as you need to answer each one. See the goddess before you. You will be lighting seven candles, one for each command. Light the first candle on the left. Hear Diana speak:

"Embrace the memory of your experience.
Do not be afraid."

Explore the memories that have continued to disturb you. Remember them, feel them. Write down key words from each situation. Light the candle to the right of the first. Hear her speak:

"Let every hurt rise up from the pool of darkness,
And I will take them from you."

Review each situation again. For each hurt, allow the pain to rise up like a cloud. See it drift up and away from you. Let Diana take it, transform it into light, and then disperse it. This is important work, so do not rush. See, feel, release. Add more incense as needed.

Light the 3rd candle. Take up the metal or ceramic bowl and the paper that you have written on. Holding one edge of the paper, light the corner. Let it burn, holding it as long as you can; then drop it into the bowl. If a small corner remains unburned, use the tongs to pick it up and relight it, or if very small, place it on the censer coal.

Sprinkle the incense on the coal, light the 4th candle and hear Diana say:

"Bathe in my pool of rest and renewal".

Visualize a beautiful woodland setting with a small lake or pool of water. Feel yourself glide into comfortable waters of rest and renewal. Float in these waters, allowing your mind to remain blank. Light the 5th candle. Hear Her speak again:

"Believe in your goodness and strength.
Forgive your imperfections".

See yourself rise up from her waters of renewal. Forgive your imperfections. Feel your own goodness and strength begin to radiate from you. Light the 6th candle.

"Understand the weakness of others.
Forgive them their imperfections".

Call to mind those who caused you pain. Forgive them their imperfections. Place them in the hands of the Goddess. Light the 7th candle. Hear Her voice:

"Soon to bed, and to restful sleep.
I will watch over you tonight,
O brave soul who is full of courage.
To sleep, and blessed dreams attend you,
O much-honored votary".

Immediately following the rite, take a bath in which you have placed a handful of Epsom salts. Let the candle burn down, and then go to bed. The next morning, take a spade and dig a hold outside. Bury the ash from the burned paper and anything that is left of the censer coal. Cover this with soil, and then stamp the soil firmly with your feet, saying:

"Fire turned to ashes,
Ashes buried in Earth,
Diana, the morning light,
I, the dawn of rebirth!"
