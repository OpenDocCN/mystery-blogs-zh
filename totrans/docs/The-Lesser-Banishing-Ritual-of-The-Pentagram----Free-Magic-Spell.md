# The Lesser Banishing Ritual of The Pentagram.

A spell to banish an area of unwanted influences, to set up a space in which to do magick.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

## Casting Instructions for 'The Lesser Banishing Ritual of The Pentagram.'

 **The Qabalistic Cross**
Face East. Visualise yourself growing, until you are stood on a tiny sphere which is the Earth and your body is suspended in space. Visualise a white sphere above your head glowing. Breathe in and vibrate the word "Attah".

With your finger or dagger, draw in the light and direct it down to the pubic bone, see the light go into the earth below you and vibrate "Malkuth". Now draw light from the line you have created and draw it to the right shoulder visualising a sphere of light forming, vibrate "Ve-Gevurah".

Now draw light to the left shoulder and see a sphere, vibrate "Ve- Gedulah" Now clasp your hands together in front of the brest and see a golden sphere of light this time, vibrate "Le-Olahm, Amen".

**Formation of Circle and Pentagrams**
Draw a banishing Earth pentagram in the east (see below), note you are not banising Earth, rather all the elements, Earth is the grounding of the three other elemental forces. You should see the pentagram as an electric blue colour- like the coulour on a gas hob.

With your dagger or finger, pierce the centre of the pentagram and vibrate the God name "YHVH", sound the letters out "Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh." See the blue colour intensify- note you should see tthe pentagrams suspended in infinite space of which you are the centre they are always surrounding you as you have constructed your inner universe.

Now with the dagger still in the centre, draw a white line round to the south (clockwise) and draw another pentagram. This time vibrate "Adonai (ah-dohn-eye). Again trace a line (you are making a circle) to the West, draw the pentagram and vibrate "AHIH- (eh-he-ay).

Trace the line to the North, draw the pentagram, and vibrate "Attah, Givor, Le Olahm, Adonai." Finish the circle by tracing the line back to the Eastern pentagram. Stand in the centre of your circle and take a few deep breaths, reinforcing the visualisation of the pentagrams.

**Archangels Evocations**
Stand with your feet together, and arms out- like you are a cross and say the following, but vibrating the names of the angels- "Before me Raphael" (Visualise an angel dressed in Yellow with a sword facing away from you and guarding the circle) "Behind me Gabriel"- Visualise an angel in blue with a chalice. "On my right hand, Michael"- An angel in red with a flaming wand. "On my left hand Uriel"- An angel in green, brown or black with a disc.

The say, "For about me flames the pentagrams"- See the pentagrams you have drawn. "And in the column shines the six-rayed star"- Visualise a golden hexagram above and below you, shining light down into the area filling the area, and your aura. Repeat the Qabalistic Cross.

If done at the end of a ceremony, i.e. no other work is to follow, give the sign of silence- Feet together, finger or thumb on bottom lip and visualise yourself as the child horus in a blue egg standing on crocodiles.....google this image.

---------------------------------------------

This ritual is used to banish unwanted energy before and after every working and to set up a sacred space in which you can do your rites. The angel forms I use are not the most used, nor accepted, I feel they do have the most basic elemental symbolism necessary and therefore are more suitable for beginners.

A lot of people believe the final god name is AGLA, however this is a notariqon (A qabalistic anacronym.), and I and many others, believe the original teaching was to vibrate it in full, as shown above.
