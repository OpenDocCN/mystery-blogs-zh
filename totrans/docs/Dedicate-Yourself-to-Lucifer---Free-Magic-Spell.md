 Write the following prayer:

"Before the almighty and ineffable God Satan/Lucifer and in the presence of all Demons of Hell, who are the True and the Original gods, I, (state your full name) renounce any and all past allegiances. I renounce the false Judeo/Christian god Jehova, I renounce his vile and worthless son Jesus Christ, I renounce his foul, odious, and rotten holy spirit.

I proclaim Satan Lucifer as my one and only God. I promise to recognize and honor him in all things, without reservation, desiring in return, his manifold assistance in the successful completion of my endeavors.

It is important to bathe before any rituals you perform, this is done out of respect. When you are ready, you can light the candle. Take the needle, prick the index finger of your left hand, squeeze some blood out."

Sign your name in blood. Recite the prayer either aloud or in your head. Fold the paper and let it burn in the fire of the candle. Many of us have stayed and meditated until the candle had burned itself out. At the end of the ritual, close with the words "So mote it be." And a Big "Hail Satan!"

does this work

I would not sign my name in blood, but I would sign my name, or Magical name, and let a few drops of my blood fall on the signature. I also feel you should research dedication rituals to add to this as it feels as if it is missing a few steps, such as the circle casting or cleansing before the ritual. Regardless, try it for yourself. Be sure to research beforehand so you do not dedicate yourself to a deity you later regret.

I Wouldn't reccomend this as this is dangerous and It MAY Work

This is a good dedication ritual prayer to lord Satan it works coz I did mine and it worked for me . Am a theistic Satanist

Have you ever tried to sell your soul or make a deal with the Devil?
