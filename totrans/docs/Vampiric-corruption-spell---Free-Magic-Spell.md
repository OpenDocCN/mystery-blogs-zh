# Vampiric corruption spell

THIS DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN ACTUAL VAMPIRE. No Magick can change what you are. It gives you some abilities, but NO BLOOD DRINKING!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Vampiric corruption spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Two black candles

*   A red candle

*   A bowl of black rose petals

*   A perfectly red apple

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Two black candles

*   A red candle

*   A bowl of black rose petals

*   A perfectly red apple

 Light the red candle, and use it to light the black ones. Arrange them in a triangle around the bowl. Place the apple in the bowl, on top of the petals. Use the red candle to drip wax into the bowl, letting a decent amount fall on the apple. Say in your most sadistic voice:

Creatures of night, harrowing fright. Ravage my magick with a vampiric blight

Take a bite of the apple. BE CAREFUL! CANDLEWAX CAN BE POISONOUS!

As implied, this spell grants some vampiric qualities. You may find yourself staying up later. Paleness is sometimes a factor. You may avoid mirrors often. It grants a few vampiric boons, as well; Spells involving darkness, blood, and shadows are easier for you.

You cannot become a vampire.

Tadashi.....not to be rude, but I actually doubt that you even read a single word on this page....cuz he specifically said: ''THIS DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN ACTUAL VAMPIRE. No Magick can change what you are. It gives you some abilities, but NO BLOOD DRINKING!''

Read the last paragraph, the person claims you gain some vampiric powers, which you will not. If you wish to become better at certain types of spells, practice. There is no quick fix solution. Try the spell and see for yourself it does not work.
