 ## Casting Instructions for 'Introducing Physical Teleportation'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** **Introduction**
Physical teleportation is the near instantaneous transport of the psychic from one location to another. Because teleportation is an extension of clairsentient ability, there are two categories of teleportation: Extensive Teleportation and Projective Teleportation. As the names imply, each is based on the type of clairsentience which must be used to target the correct location.

Although teleportation is nearly instantaneous, the psychic may be disoriented upon arrival at the new location. 

Extensive Teleportation: this is the ability to teleport one's body a short distance, overcoming intervening barriers to normal travel. In order to use extensive teleportation, the targeted location must be sensed via sense extension, or must be in physical sight of the psychic. Teleportation is nearly instantaneous once activated, and can generally be accomplished in the same OP during which clairsentience was used to locate the target. The psychic remains subject to possible disorientation at the new location.
