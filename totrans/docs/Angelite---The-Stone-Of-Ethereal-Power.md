> “Angelite – The Celestial Stone”

Hi and welcome to Wicca Now. As you may already know, Wicca Now is a site where Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/), this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or this article on [moonstone](https://wiccanow.com/moonstone/) Today I thought we’d focus on another beautiful crystal, namely Angelite.

## Angelites General Characteristics

**Angelite ranges in colour from blue to violet and translucent to opaque. Named after a celestial blue sky, Angelite was commonly used by the ancient Egyptians to make small vases, statues and flasks. Ground into a powder, the stone was used as a pigment throughout the middle ages, its particular shade of blue finding popularity for the depiction of heavenly skies.**

As its name implies, the stone is considered the perfect tool for communicating with the angelic realm. Many crystal witches find Angelite to be instrumental when interpreting messages from the other side and work with the stone to support many aspects of their magickal work. The benefits of the stone include:

*   General support for all magickal work
*   Beneficial when communicating with the angelic realm
*   Fosters compassion
*   Aids forgiveness
*   Fosters generosity
*   Functions as a guardian and protector
*   Effective when developing psychic skills
*   Fosters the expansion of awareness
*   Helpful in quieting feelings of anxiety
*   Reduces feelings of stress
*   Fosters a sense of self-acceptance

## Spells Featuring Angelite

### A Ritual for Connecting with the Angelic Realm

Angelite is wonderful for opening the channels of communication with the angeltic real. Use this ritual to connect with your special guardian angel.

Ingredients:

*   You will need five pieces of angelite

Method:

*   Arrange four stones in a semi-circle. Lay with your head in the centre of the circle and place the fifth stone on your heart. Close your eyes and feel the energy of the stones as they create a vortex of angelic frequency around you. Feel yourself opening to the angelic realm as you focus on the stone on your heart. Allow the energy of the stones to wash over you. If you feel your attention is suddenly drawn to the stone on your heart you will know that an angel has reached out to you.
