**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**A Quartz crystal emits the frequency of energy, a vibration. Romanies are known for using crystal balls for clairvoyance, but they also use quartz rock crystal for healing.
If you have a piece of quartz, first wash it in warm soapy water and rinse it with running water. Then hold the crystal in both hands. Close your eyes and imagine being bathed in white light.

Place the crystal under your pillow while you sleep.
