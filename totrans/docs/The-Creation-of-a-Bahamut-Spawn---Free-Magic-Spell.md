# The Creation of a Bahamut-Spawn

  Rated 5/5 Stars

NOTE: I HAVE NEVER PERFORMED THIS SPELL MYSELF NOR DO I ADVOCATE ITS PERFORMANCE DUE TO THE RISKS INVOLVED. This historical spell dates back several thousand years and it is not known whether it works or has EVER worked. I post this only for scholarship's sake

Be warned, all who attempt this spell: this is high-level magic and extremely dangerous even to advanced practitioners. It is not meant to be attempted. If you do choose to perform this enchantment, take all possible precautionsmake sure to wear a protective amulet strong enough to stave off forces from the abyss itself, and that the subject of this spell is bound tightly with magical bonds.

The purpose of this spell is to summon part of the essence of the powerful primordial being Bahamut into a target, altering them irrevocably and turning them into an almost-immortal warrior. However, this spell has serious effects upon the human mind and more often than not drives the target into insanity, transforming them into naught but a vassal of Bahamut itself. Be warned. Below is the original text of this spell, taken from the Matrix of Shebosk and translated into English. The annotations in parentheses are merely my own clarifications of the spell's finer points.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A voice

*   Powerful magical chains

*   A sacred candle

## Casting Instructions for 'The Creation of a Bahamut-Spawn'

The Invocation of Bahamut and the Creation of Its Children

There comes a time in the life of a sorcerer of true ambition when he finds the need for a minion of unsurpassed strength and power, with the vigor and endurance of the greatest soldier melded to the obedient mind of a vassal. The creation of such a being is possible and indeed has been done before many times in the past. The offspring of the following spell will be of the greatest breed of warrior known yet to man. It will have the strength of thirty fine oxen and the speed of a bird in flight, and will know not deaths embrace despite the wounds inflicted on it. The Children of Bahamut may be killed again and again, but again and again they shall rise, made by their anger even more powerful than before.

But be warned, as the creature that I now instruct ye how to make is doomed to live a life most wretched and cursed, as though it may not die it must live with its pain until the end of time. And indeed the mind of the Spawn may be shattered, though its body will repair despite all punishment. So before this spell is used, consider ye, wise soul, the fate of your creation and if ye find pity in your heart turn back now.

If indeed you proceed to create a Child of Bahamut, ye will need a person of fitness and health, as no other will survive the invocation. And despite the state of him mind he must be bound by chains of strongest quality, and enchanted to resist the powers here summoned.

Proceed, then, after thy chosen man is ready, to mark about his body a pentacle (note that the text is very unspecific here. It does not actually list the type of pentacle you need, but a different, though slightly inferior, transcription of this spell states that only a simple inverse pentacle is required.) in the sanctified ointment that drips from thy holy candle. Then, using still the same divine ink, mark on his chest the symbol of Bahamut, the greatest of the Dark Primordials (The symbol referred to here is simply an ouroboros).

Touch, then, in turn the points of the pentacle, and mark upon each a rune of these five: Hunger, Strength, Plague, Fury and Resistance. (Note that it does not list the precise runes or the language needed, but any runic script works here as long as all are in the same language. Considering Bahamuts origin, Babylonian may be a good choice.) Once the runes are placed, touch each again in turn, while speaking its name aloud.

Next invoke Bahamut itself, summoning the Dark Primordial through the power of the pentacle. Speak aloud like so as you open the portal to the Warp and complete the summoning: Bahamut, greatest of the Dark Primordials, I offer up this mortal shell as a vessel for thy power. Meet the mind within with thy own and merge thy energies with this link to the natural world. Consume, empower, infect, enrage, and sanctify this body so that it never again may die and will walk as a host to thy glory.

Following the incantation Bahamuts energies shall surge into the given host, altering it and transforming it into a virtually immortal warrior to serve thy cause.

Now begins thy true test as a mage. Using the powers given to thee, thou must now separate Bahamut from the chosen host. This may be done using any form of power, but may indeed destroy the attempting sorcerer. If the connection is cut in time, the man into which Bahamut was summoned will be man no more, but a hybrid or unsurpassed power. If the attempt to break the connection fails, thou and the host shall both be consumed by the forces of the Warp.

Once the spell is complete, merely break the pentacle. Take care, though, with the new Child of Bahamut, as it shall greatly exceed thee in physical power if not magical and must be persuaded to serve rather than destroy.

This spell can only be reversed by the powers of Seraph itself, if he chooses to grant his blessings to the spell-born being created with the method here listed.
