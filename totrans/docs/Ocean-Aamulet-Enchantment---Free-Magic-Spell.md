 Fill the bowl with water. Then add salt. Take a shower while it settles. Meditate while holding the amulet near your chest. Visualize the ocean spreading through your blood and shielding your heart. Put the amulet in the water and say "With the power of the sea, of Poseidon and Neptune as one, I power this amulet and claim it as mine".

For a more indepth enchantment, fill the bowl with rain or ocean water instead of regular. You can choose to swim in the ocean or run in the rain instead of taking a shower. Sit in a circle of candles when doing the spell.

For what can you use the amulet or what can it do?

You can wear it while casting water or ocean magick or weather spells. Also, to anyone who may not have a necklace, anything can work as long as the water won't do anything bad to it. Homemade trinkets work just as well
