# Succubus/Incubus Transformation

Makes your friend into a succubus/incubus to serve you.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Succubus/Incubus Transformation'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Friend

*   Item to signify love (heart-shaped stone, rose, etc.)

*   Rope or straps

*   Outfit of choice

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Friend

*   Item to signify love (heart-shaped stone, rose, etc.)

*   Rope or straps

*   Outfit of choice

Have your friend lay down on their back, and use the rope/straps to tie them down. Have the outfit folded up next to them. Place the love item on their chest (succubus) or abdomen (incubus). Chant:

''Make (Name of friend) to my servant. He/she will wear the outfit provided forever. I want him/her to be mine and mine alone. Make him/her my succubus/incubus! So mote it be!''

Your friend and the outfit should glow brightly. The outfit will unfold and put itself on your friend, and replace their current clothing by removing, folding, and placing down their current outfit. The item you placed on your friend will melt into them, and grow that area of their body by a considerable amount. The outfit will shrink and expand as needed. Your friend will have become a succubus/incubus about 5 minutes after this process is completed, and they will stop glowing. Recommended outfit for succubus: Maid.

Soooo..... Is there a way to reverse the process......

If this actually worked I'd love to see it. I don't think there is, but I'm not a pro

This is a fake spell. You can't transform someone into an incubus/succubus.

I dont think its about physically changing them into a succubus or incubus, in my experience something like this is dangerous because you are inviting an entity to inhabit a persons body which Rhododendron is possible. I think this post should be edited or deleted honestly as it wont give the desired effect of altering their body but does open them up to being inhabited by an entity, likely not even the desired one but rather any one that is nearby and has a desire to do so.

You cannot physically transform into a succubus. Also, it is rather cruel to transform your friend into a servant, as the description suggests. You might wish to do some self reflection and check your moral compass if you genuinely desire to make them subservient to you.

how can i become one myself
