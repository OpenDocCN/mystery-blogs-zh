# Ode To The Vampire Mother

  Rated 5/5 Stars

O dea tenebris
Mater immortalibus
Puer tuus fac me sicut renascentur
Mea lux vestra absobere

Liceat mihi locus ad tenebras
Sicut ex utero immortales
Filios tuos in ulnis
Quibus invocaverit te frater

O lunae lumen
Puer tuus fac me sicut renascentur
Me duce tenebris sunt
I ita erit renatus

English translation

Oh goddess of the darkness
Mother to the immortal
Let me be reborn as your child
Let your light absorb my own

Allow me passage to the darkness
As from your immortal womb
Into the arms of your children
To whom I will call brother

Oh moonlight
Let me be reborn as your child
Guide the dark ones to me
So I shall be born again

This spell summons vampires to find you, then to turn you. You have to invite them into your home. They will come when the time is right. Good luck.
