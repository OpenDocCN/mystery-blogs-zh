 ## Casting Instructions for 'Telekinesis for Beginners'

*   Patience

*   Or

*   Small, light object

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Full concentration

*   Patience

*   Belief

*   Psi wheel

*   Or

*   Small, light object

Sit in a room that is quite. Take your small object or psi wheel and place it somewhere, sit close next to it.

What you want to do now, is to cup your hands around the object and imagine energy flowing through your hands. Don't use your own energy because you will get tired easily, instead use another source of energy. And imagine your self obtaining energy from that. I use the sun as my energy source because it is full of energy, and my element is fire.

Imagine the object moving in your mind. This is the hard part though, don't stress too much or focus on it too much, or have little focus on it. Just imagine that your doing something simple, like typing on the keyboard or something. Just keep doing that, and don't worry if it doesn't work for the first time! It also happens to me as well.

Congrats! You just did basic telekinesis! Just practice doing this daily, and soon you might be able to do telekinesis without too much pressure I also recommend meditating for about 15-30 minutes a day, it just helps you focus more. Message me if this spell works!

Has anyone tried this? I'm gonna try this daily to see if I can do it, but I want to see if others can too. Also, it gave my hand a weird feeling, almost like pain.

You mean your hand was tingly??

I got a question is there a certain age rating for these spells before I do something stupid?

Careful with banned language [last word in your question, while directed at you, is considered hate speech] but outside of being 13 or older to be on this site, there's no age requirement. I would go with a skill requirement. If you've been practicing for a week and want to summon Cthulu, maybe wait a bit, but if it's something like light a candle and say a chant, I don't see the harm. Use your judgement. If you think you're ready to try a spell, give it a go [just shield and maybe cast a circle first to be safe] Reading over this, it's a practice for beginners, you should be fine.

Telekenisis is not real. This spell outlines charging items with energy, then adds nonsense of moving them with your mind. You can charge objects with energy. You need to be careful not to drain your bodys energy. You cannot move objects with your mind.
