This is not a working spell you can not control water like that with real magick

You do not have water powers. You can work with the element of water. Research potion craft.

If you do end up putting any candles out with this, it's likely due to air currents from you waving your arms about. Just so anyone trying this knows. It'll have nothing at all to do with water.
