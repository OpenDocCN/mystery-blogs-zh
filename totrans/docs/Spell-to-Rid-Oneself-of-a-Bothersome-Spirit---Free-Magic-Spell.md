Before starting, place your hand before you, and start the flow of power out of your hand and then say the words below, letting the envisioned blue-white light from your power hand fill the room or house or any other place that you might be.

How do I turn this spell off

There should be no need to turn a spell off. A spell can be dismantled or neutralized. In this case it may be simply to cease using the spell. It should dissipate on its own.
