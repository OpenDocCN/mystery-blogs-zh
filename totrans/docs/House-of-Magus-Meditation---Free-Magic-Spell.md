Get your mind nice and clear. Maybe light some incense and play some ambiance. If you choose to play something, nature sounds would be good for this exercise.
Imagine you are wearing white robes with a maroon shoal over your shoulders. You are walking on a stone path that cuts through a field of red and white flowers. The sky is a vibrant blue with few clouds. Take your time stepping through here and pick a couple of flowers, smell them. The white ones could smell like gardenias, the red ones like roses. Take in the beautiful scents and the sun on your skin. Keep walking a bit.
After walking for a short while, you come across a big stone castle. As you get closer, you see that the front doors are open. It looks safe and no one is around, so you decide to go into the castle. You see a grand staircase in front of you with flags of all symbols going up the railing. To the left and right, you see doors. You decide to go to your right and shake the door handle to see that the door is unlocked. You step inside, and find a room with one window at the opposite side of the room. In the middle of the room, there is a small and modest altar. Upon it, you see a pentagram, a cup, some coins and a wand.
You have the urge to pick up this wand, and you do so. You can feel energy coursing through you. You point the want to the ground and feel energy going out from this wand going to the floor, and you feel the tingle of it on the bottoms of your feet. At your amazement, you put the wand down and contemplate what has just happened.
after this contemplation, you leave the castle, and go back on your way on the trail.
