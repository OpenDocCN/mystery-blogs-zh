# Soul reading (customizable spell)

A spell that allows the ability to percieve differently(sorry if I have some english problems)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Soul reading (customizable spell)'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** So this is a spell that allows you to percieve differently than what you normally. This may or may not work and is super hard to get just right. Let's go over the details of the instructions.

So imagine a game (or anything really) and imagine your life, but within the game example: normal life but with the ability to open up the undertale menu. This is not a physical spell and will obviously not create a actual menu screen or a health bar or anything of the sort.

*Do Not Try anything dangerous like jump off a cliff because you can slow time in real life without any safety equipment*

  Good luck :3 ~<3
