 Put one drop on your wrist and rub it on your neck like cologne/perfume any way whatsoever, safely, though.

If they are out of stock go to a botanica (google them like this: "Botanica, NYC or your city")

If you don't have a credit card go to a walmart and buy a greendot gift card and put like two bucks into the card and then you can buy items from this store. You can also use paypal I think, they sell paypal cards at walmart. Check first, though.

Again, here is the item in the spellsofmagic.com store: http://www.spellsofmagic.com/shop_details.html?c=O&s=Indio+Oils&id=9060
