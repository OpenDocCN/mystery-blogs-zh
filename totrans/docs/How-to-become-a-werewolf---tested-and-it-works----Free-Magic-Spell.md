# How to become a werewolf. ~tested and it works~

This is another spell on how to become a werewolf like from Zombies 2\. Check out my other one. This one just has a bit more info about it. If you say this is not true or this spell is fake well please keep that to yourself. Don't tell me about it in the comments. Please just send me an email about it.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Picture of the wolf you want to be with any information on the picture.

*   A moonstone embedded object like necklace, bracelet, ring or earring.

*   Voice

*   Belief

*   And a bit of pain tolerance.

## Casting Instructions for 'How to become a werewolf. ~tested and it works~'

 First take the moonstone and place it in the floor beside you. Then take the picture and place it in front of you. Then think of your mate/s.

Then place the moonstone on the picture and say this spell:

' Wolves of strength and power. Let me be a werewolf like my mates. I will protect my pack and live with them. I shall be strong and powerful. This is my wish so mote it be ' 

Then you take the moonstone and put it on or hold it.

You shall be a werewolf in 3-7 days. Then after 3 days you should try to transform.

Just one problem is that you will have a white streak in your hair. Dye stays in it for 2-3 days. Just claim it is poliosis and it's normal. And you must wear the moonstone almost every day or after a month you will die if you don't touch a moonstone object. If you don't were it after 3 days you will have coughing fits.

How to transform is you think yourself as your chosen wolf. To detransform think to yourself as human with any chosen clothes on. Your old clothes will be transported to the wash. Your first transformation will hurt but after the first time it won't hurt much. Like banging your funny bone (why do they call it that when it's not even funny!) And that's one your first transformation. Any others won't hurt.

Side affects: 

Taste for meat.

Get angry more easily.

Eyes glowing yellow when you're angry or threatened.

Urges to growl and snarl

Urge to howl.

Urges to be free.

Sharper teeth mainly the canines.

Sharper nails.

Speed increased

Better hearing

Strength increased.

Desire to be outside.

Better smell.

Urge to smell any of you meals/food.

Better sight

If you love someone or something you'll really love. If you hate something or someone you'll really hate.

If you have these next side affects then be careful. I am trying my best to fix this with another spell: **warning following is not for 13 year Olds and under. Skip till you see more bold. Do not report this spell as you have been warned. Thank you.**

Wanting to kill others on Blood Moons, Blue Moons, New year Day, New year Eve, weekends, at school and on heat (heat is just for females).

Have sharp pains in your um. You know what part on weekends. Once a month. For both genders.

**You can read now.**

sorry about that. My cousin got a hold of my phone and put that in.

If you don't have any of these then that is good but if so please tell me in the comments.

This spell will not work as you cant psychically transform into a werewolf you are human

You cannot physically transform into a werewolf.

I was thinking the same thing. Why say it's tested when it doesn't work

Simple, to sound real. People want to sound powerful, cool, legitimate [take your pick] so they lie because it's anonymous [yes, we know the username but not the person behind the screen] So little things like taking a necklace, saying some words won't harm anyone physically, but scammers in the pagan spaces are very common. ''Give me 20$ and I'll cast a spell to make all of your dreams come true.'' Total scam, but desperate people will believe it. I've heard horror stories of people losing thousands because someone started out with a 20$ love spell that became ''your family is being cursed by a coven of Satanic witches. I can save you if you send me 1000$ for supplies plus 500$ for me to cast it'' and some will actually pay. I don't want to scare anyone or to mistrust, every online caster, just think before you act. Magick is real, but on the physical it has limitations. The majority of the time, bad luck is just normal misfortunes and not someone with a grudge cursing you [honestly, witches curse other witches, especially online, is incredibly rare, and even rarer it works because of natural protections, your own protection spells, and even the skill of the other witch. Those who boast rarely act on their words]

jesus christ wtf. This is heavily misinformational. Any spell that requires you to have some sort of object (specifically a bracelet or other piece of jewelry) is completely false. This will not work at all, and is way too twilight-esque. Good inspo for crappy wattpad stories though. Please give out real information instead of giving many children the false hope for false results.
