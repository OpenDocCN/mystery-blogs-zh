## Casting Instructions for 'Mermaid Spell 2016 ~My Spell~'

 What To Do: Sit the jewelry in the Bowl Make Sure You Cast A Circle Using Some Water Around You And The Bowl. (You Might Wanna Do This In Your Bathroom It'll Be Easy To Clean Up) It Doesn't Have To Be Water But It Has To Represent A Mermaid So It Can Be Hair Or Something. Okay After You Cast The Circle Don't Forget To Say The Spell To Keep Away Evil (You Can Find That On My Spell Longer Hair Or I'll Leave It In The Description) So Pour Some Of The Water On The Jewelry While Chanting:

''As This Magick Water Touches This (The Piece Of Jewelry You Have) Its Giving It A Special Power....The Power To Make The One Who Possesses This Ring A Mermaid When They Put It On And Step In Water.'' Stop Pouring The Water When The Piece Of Jewelry Is Able To Float. Then Stir It And Say ''This (Piece Of Jewelry You Have) Has Special Mermaid/Merman Powers In It...Such As Swimming Speed And 3 Other Powers With Are (Your Power),(Your Power),And (Your Power) And only 1 Special Power From My Ring Based On My Personality So Mote It Be!!

I Will List Some Of The Powers You Can Have But You Must Only Pick 3

Hydrokinesis: allows him to move water without touching it as well as expand it and mold it into different shapes. With this power a mermaid/merman can create balls of water, blasts of water or even geysers strong enough to lift people off the ground.

Cryokonesis: It is the power to create ice as well as create and control blizzards and snowfalls

Hydro-Thermokinesis: it allows a merperson to heat and boil water.
. This power can come in handy when in need of a steam cover, melting ice, or drying off quickly

Gelidkinesis: It allows a merperson to change the viscosity or thickness of water. Gelidkinesis has been shown to be able to turn water into a jelly-like substance.

Substanciakinesis: Is the power to turn water into a solid state, without freezing it. It can be seen as an enhancement of Gelidkinesis in that it solidifies water instead of merely jellying it.

Mecokinesis: t is the ability of combined substanciakinesis and gelidkinesis will equal the ability to explode water or jelly, and also be used to glue objects together or create enough sticky or jelly ease in objects causing them to poor bucket loads of goose or sticky slime.This has been used to manipulate and mold mud or slime.

Volume Reduction is the ability to shrink objects. The hand motion for this power is to use the thumb and index finger and move up and down with the fingers.

Electrokinesis: This power can summon a bolt of lightning from the sky, and aim it at a spot on the ground or a target. It causes extreme lightning and power outages.

Sirena was asked to use this ability by singing the Enchantment Song, which presumably gives the Siren Singing power to whoever sings it, and is not a natural power.

SIDE EFFECTS:
Lower Body Parts Itching
Your Feet Feeling Like A
Mermaid Tail And Different,
Pointier Ears,
Feeling More Connected To Sea Animals.
