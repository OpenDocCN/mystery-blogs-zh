*   Few drops of Human Pheromones

*   Red Candle

 Begin Part 1:

In you bedroom, open your curtains. If it's warm enough, open your windows and let the moonshine and breezes in.
Light some candles around your bedroom and make yourself comfortable on your bed, placing the unlit red candle on your bedside table. Hold the stones in your power hand (the one you write with). Visualize yourself in love; love, given and received, enhancing your life. At this point, put a few drops of the human pheromones behind your ear and on your wrists.

What type of partner do you want to share your days with? What type of relationship do you wish to have? Don't focus on who you want, rather what you want. Honesty, commitment, respect, love. Casting a spell to make someone love you is wrong. It isn't fair, it violates the Wiccan Rede, and it always backfires. Visualizing yourself with love in your life is a wonderful thing. Sharing your life with someone special is something all of us have in common. Actively taking part in its manifestation helps us to be open to the possibility of such love.

On to Part 2:

Charge the three stones with the emotions you generate and your wish to attract love into your life. Set the stones around your red candle. Light your candle and let it burn all the way down. As the candle slowly burns, the energy you charged the stones with is slowly released. Give thanks and close the rite.
