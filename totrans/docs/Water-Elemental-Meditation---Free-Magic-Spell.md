**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Drinking water

*   Open glass or container

*   Recording of water sounds

 Gather your ingredients. You should be able to hear, see, smell, touch, and taste water. To start, listen to its sound. Next, look at the water source or at the water in your container. Pause to consider how vital water is to our existence. Think of all the ways we use it and how life would be without it. Be grateful for water.

Touch it, and then take a drink. Engage all your senses in experiencing water. The element of water represents emotions and feelings. Try to get in touch with this aspect of yourself, and consider all the aspects of water: rain, lakes, springs, streams, and oceans, and its association with the womb. Do this for at least ten or fifteen minutes, then say:

"Ripples on the pond. Sacred spring and well. The current and the tide. Watch it flow and swell. Water of the Earth, water from above, water of the world: Fill us with your love".
