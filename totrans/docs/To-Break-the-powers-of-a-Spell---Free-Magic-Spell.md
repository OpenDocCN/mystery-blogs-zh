**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   black candle.

*   water.

*   a black bowl.

PLACE THE CANDLE INTO THE BLACK BOWL, FIX THE CANDLE TO THE BOWL USING THE WAX DRIPPINGS FROM THE CANDLE SO THAT IT STANDS ALONE. FILL THE BOWL TO THE RIM WITH FRESH WATER, WITHOUT WETTING THE WICK. BREATHE DEEPLY AND MEDITATE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES. WHEN YOUR MIND IS CLEAR, LIGHT THE CANDLE. VISUALIZE THE POWER OF THE SPELL CAST AGAINST YOU AS LIVING WITHIN THE CANDLES FLAME. AS THE CANDLE BURNS DOWN, IT WILL SPLUTTER AND GO OUT AS IT TOUCHES THE WATER. AS IT IS EXTINGUISHED BY THE WATER, THE SPELL IS BROKEN .FINALLY, DIG A HOLE IN TO THE GROUND, POUR THE WATER INTO IT, THEN BURY THE CANDLE.

If you charge it with the intention to cleanse you, this could work. I typically use salt instead of water. I would also observe the way the candle burns as well as the flame as this could determine how the spell is going.
