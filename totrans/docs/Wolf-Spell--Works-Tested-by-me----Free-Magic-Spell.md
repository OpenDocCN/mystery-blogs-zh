Sadly one cannot physically shift into any sort of animal. So any spell that claims to do this is fake. Hopefully the person posting this spell is merely misguided and not trying to purposefully lead you astray. It is possible to take on another shape on the astral plane and in dreams, just not to physically shift. You are human and you will remain human.

You cannot physically transform into a werewolf.
