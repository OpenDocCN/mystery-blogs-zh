## Casting Instructions for 'Opening The Gates of Power'

 **Opening the Gates of Power**

This is accomplished in much the same manner as Macha's Fence. But for this the God Manannan Mac Lir is called upon to aid the magician. The main sources of power will be The Two Powers and the energies of Land, Sea and Sky. The Two Powers represent Earth and Sky, Underworld and Upperworld. Land, Sea and Sky represent the three elements found in Celtic thought. Any altar used should be in the center of the working area and represent the Bil, or the World Tree, which is the center of all things and touches all realms. As you open each gate, know that it will remain open and that its energies will be available during the entire ritual.

The prayer is: "We call upon Manannan Mac Lir, Keeper of the Gates. Aid us in opening the gates to the realms of power. Keep us safe from harmful influences and let the energies summoned be balanced and potent. Manannan... Manannan... Manannan."

As with Macha's fence, the last three intonations of Manannan's name are vibrated.

Then, face the altar, using your power hand, make a clockwise spiral motion, saying: "Let this gate be opened. This altar is the Bil, the sacred Worldtree, the center about which all else revolves. Let this gate be opened." See that the altar is actually the Bil, and feel its energy.

Next look up and raise your hands. Make a clockwise spiral towards the ceiling, while saying: "Let this gate be opened. Power of the Upperworld descends down to Middle. Let this gate be opened." See energy descending down to fill the ritual area.

Next look down and lower your hands. Make a clockwise spiral towards the floor, while saying: "Let this gate be opened. Power of the Underworld rises to Middle. Let this gate be opened." See energy rising up to fill the ritual area.

Next, move counter-clockwise to the stone representing the Land. With your power hand, make a clockwise spiral over it while saying: "Let this gate be opened. This is the Land upon which we stand. Let this gate be opened." See yourself standing on firm, stable land. Feel its power.

Next, continue to move counter-clockwise to the bowl or cauldron of water which represents the Sea. Make a spiral motion over it, clockwise, saying: "Let this gate be opened. This is the Sea that surrounds us. Let this gate be opened." See yourself in a great sea, feel its power.

Now move counter-clockwise to the incense representing the Sky. Light it and make a clockwise spiral over it saying: "Let this gate be opened. This is the Sky that stretches over us. Let this gate be opened. " See the great expanse of the sky surrounding you, and feel it's power.

The gates are now opened, and your energy sources are ready to be utilized in your magick. Alternatively, or additionally, you could have opened gates of the fire and well, as in ADF liturgy.
