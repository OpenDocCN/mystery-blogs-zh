For teaching me ancient ways. For experiences both good and bad that has made me stronger. For the people you have taught me through. For the pleasures in which I have partaken. As I sleep, I ask that I may enter your dark realm. So that I may be in your unholy presence. Guide me, Satan, unto yourself. And may I be forever grasped in your mighty wings. Ave Satanas"
