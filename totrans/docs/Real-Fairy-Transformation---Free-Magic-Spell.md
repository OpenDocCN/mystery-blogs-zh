You cannot become a fairy.

I have explained on other spells and forums. Physical transformation is not possible as a result of the natural limitations of Real Magic. On the physical plane it is ruled by nature and cannot contradict nature, ergo this spell is fake. You can work with The Fae, but you cannot become one.

If you are looking for a person to point to and blame, there is nobody, but you can yell at me since most people do, Mermaid47\. This is simply a natural law like gravity or the Earths rotation. On the physical plane, Magic does not defy nature. Fae are spirits of nature, you can work with them, I know this for a fact because I have worked with them for a long time. You cannot physically transform into one because humans cannot naturally change into other creatures, it is not in our nature, ergo, it contradicts nature, ergo, Magic will not make it so. See for yourself if you still do not accept my words as facts, but I assure you Magic does not contradict nature.

If you really do this right and believe in it u can become a fairy.

Fae are spiritual beings, they are not physical like we are. We cannot change our species with magick, that simply isn't how it works, no matter how much belief you have.

Do you wear it and say the spell, or hold it and say the spell and how many times do you say it?

You can do any of the above, you still won't turn into a fairy

why are they so many fakes spells around here?

Because only the site admin can delete spells and he has more important things to do like keep the site running. A lot of these are old spells and were uploaded by people who didn't know the difference between real and fake spells. Since a lot of people come to this site to marvel at the fake spells, we get ad revenue and the site remains free for the members. [Lesser of two evils I guess] This is probably why the admin made the spells comment section so people could help each other learn [though they've become more of a shouting match] If you're interested in working with faeries, I would do a little research first since they can be tricky creatures, but there are a handful of working spells calling on the fae [though, you might have an easier time simply asking in the site forums for faerie spells instead of clicking on 90 fake spells to find 10 real ones] Best of luck to you.
