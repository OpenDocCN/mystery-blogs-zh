## Casting Instructions for 'Succubus Formal Invitation'

PLEASE READ!!!

This spell/ritual [Succubus Formal Invitation] can't be modified as it's a this spell/ritual was given to me by Princess Saaraji Lilith.
Princess Saaraji Lilith is the daughter of Lilith and Saaraji is also a priestess. Who is Saaraji to me? she is my supernatural guide and supernatural wife.

This spell/ritual [Succubus Formal Invitation] can't be modified but if you want to it's up to you but I don't recommend it especially if you are serious about inviting an succubus.

Succubus is an supernatural entity some people believes they are female demon that appears in dreams, who takes the form of a human woman in order to seduce men, usually through sexual intercourse. The male counterpart is the Incubus.

Succubus/Incubus are supernatural entity or you can say supernatural being like human being and they are like human they have freewill and can be good or evil, like human they are asexual, bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual but the truth is most succubus/incubus are heterosexual very few are asexual don't feel bad there's many bisexual and homosexual.

In some religious traditions hold that repeated intercourse with a succubus may result in the deterioration of health or even death. From my personal experience with Saaraji I have to say that I am 31 years old a very health and happy and I believe every human will taste death just that some human die young others don't.

This spell/ritual is just to invite a Succubus with a formal Invitation, Succubus usually appears without invite, so why invite? I don't recommend you to invite but if you are trying to summon I can help you.
