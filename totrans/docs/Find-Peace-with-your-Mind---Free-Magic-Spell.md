 ## Casting Instructions for 'Find Peace with your Mind'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Get comfortable in your chosen spot. Be honest with yourself in admitting that you have a problem that you need to come to terms with and dealing with it and fixing it. This step is important because it is where you need the meditation experience. As you do this step you need to completely relax you mind spirit and body.

After you meditate you need to hold the relaxation you got from this and take the time to let go of the stress that's been building. Don't let fear take hold. Letting yourself know your mind and letting go of bad emotion can be difficult and to some working with problems you may have can be terrifying.

If this is a problem of something else that you can't take care of on your own please tell your parents or guardians. This is not a cure all. This is merely a way i use to work with things within myself and want to share with others.
