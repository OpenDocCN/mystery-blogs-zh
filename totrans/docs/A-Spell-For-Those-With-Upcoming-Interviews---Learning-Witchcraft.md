# A Spell For Those With Upcoming Interviews - Learning Witchcraft

> 来源：[https://learningwitchcraft.com/a-spell-for-those-with-upcoming-interviews/#0001-01-01](https://learningwitchcraft.com/a-spell-for-those-with-upcoming-interviews/#0001-01-01)

Do you have a job interview coming up? Well, this spell will boost your chances of success. You should do the spell on a Wednesday when the moon is waxing rather than waning. You’re in much better hands if the interview has been scheduled for the weeks when Virgo or Gemini rule. For the altar adornment, you should use an almond blossom but you can always use a silver cloth.

If you don’t have any of these, you can always use an indigo one. For the crystals, you should use tiger’s eye or amethyst and place a bowl of dill on the altar to add some potency to the magic spell. Here, you need silver tinted leaves (such as silver birch), an ad describing the job you want, one silver taper candle, your career resume, one white altar candle and your educational certificates.

You should light the white candle then focus on the flame while meditating for a minute on the job you want. Imagine yourself shaking hands with the interviewer, getting the job and doing it successfully thereafter. Ask your favorite deity or deities to shine on your endeavors before lighting up the silver candle. Stand in front of the altar with your arms fully stretched above your head and repeat the following words.

*‘The job I want is my ken,*
*make me first among all men,*
*may those who interview me see,*
*that the one they need is me*
*and let it be done that it harm no one.’*

With the candles burning down, imagine yourself doing the job until the flames flicker and die or a lot of time runs out and you snuff them out. Thank all the elements and end the ritual.
