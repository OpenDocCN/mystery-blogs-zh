This is an explanation of the good fortune cat statues typically seen in Chinese and Japanese restaurants. It can be used to bring good fortune to you, but you would need to cleanse and dedicate it for that purpose as well as place it in the right spot in your home. Simply buying a statue will not bring good luck.
