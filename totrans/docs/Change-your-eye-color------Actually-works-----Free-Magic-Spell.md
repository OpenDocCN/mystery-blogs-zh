This spell will have your eyes turn into another color(lasts one day).It will work best in the morning, because it'll have more time to change and when they finally do change color it won't be ten at night:D. If your using a candle, light it. Then sit down, meditate for a bit, and chillax :). Then fill your mind with the color your eyes are currently, and concentrate on that color for about a minute or two. Then visualize the color going into a bright white light. Then, picture the light becoming the color you want your eyes to be. While picturing this, chant ''become of me'' 3x. Do this process two more times, and your eyes will change throughout the day. Blessed Be!!! :D

oooo imma get a candle when i can and try this

Unfortunately spells like this are a waste of time and effort. Eye color is determined by one's genes. And while one's eye color can seem slightly more faded or slightly darker toned when dated, narrowed, or in differing lighting... their defacto color can not be changed by a function of will.

The best a person might hope for with this would be an illusory/glamoir effect where other people might be influenced into seeing your eyes as a different color. Perhaps focus on that intent instead if looking for a literal physical change.

You cannot change your eye colour with Real Magik. At best, you can cast a glamour to give the illusion.
