This sounds like a working spell, but I would advise against calling on so many beings if you do not already work with them. I do not work with angels, so I do not know how they behave. However, if you call on deities, they should receive an offering of thanks. While some will accept a simple thank you, many expect something in exchange. Personally, I would omit the beings I do not work with, instead calling on ones I do, and edit the chant to reflect these changes.
