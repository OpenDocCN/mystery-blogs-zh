Now both the colored ribbon that belongs to yourself. (The other person will have their own colored ribbon). Each sprinkle rainwater onto this ribbon. "This is me, and my choices, set them free, at their purest."

Next both take the other persons color ribbon and sprinkle rainwater on them. Say "We are together bound by positivity, we coexist in perfect harmony."
