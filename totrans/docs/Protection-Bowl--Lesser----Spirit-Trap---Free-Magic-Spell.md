  Rated 5/5 Stars

Make powerful protection bowl/spirit trap in an ancient Christian way!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Protection Bowl (Lesser) / Spirit Trap'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Holy Water (Obtained from orthodox Christian church)

*   Crystal Bowl

*   Basil

*   Frankincense

*   An Orthodox icon of saint you feel drawn to

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Holy Water (Obtained from orthodox Christian church)

*   Crystal Bowl

*   Basil

*   Frankincense

*   An Orthodox icon of saint you feel drawn to

 Take the holy water and pour it in some unsealed jar without a lead, put few fragments of frankincense in the water, cover it with pure cloth and leave it overnight.

Tomorrow filter out that water in a crystal bowl, and if there is any kind of residue, burn it and bury the ashes in the ground that will not be desecrated in any way.

Make a bouquet out of the basil, and use it to make sign of cross on the waters surface three times as you read psalm 51, 91 and 23

Put that Bowl in front of the icon of the saint, and keep it all safe. Bowl is not covered with anything, so water will evaporate overtime, thusly particles of holy water in your vicinity will create powerful atmosphere of Holy Uncreated Energies of God, and bowl works like a true ghost buster marvel! Anything unclean, be it spirit or curse or bad energy will be sucked into the water and trapped in it! If there is bad influence around you, water will become murky, and that is good! do not throw out that murky water yet! let it absorb as much as it can, then go some place outdoors dig up small hole in a ground that will not get desecrated in any way and pour that water with your new "catch" in it. Ofcourse after that you will need to create another bowl, and if water gets murky again, well, just be stubborn and repeat process over and over like real ghost buster!

Last bowl I made was few years ago and bowl is still crystal clear! Actually today I took few sips from it and drank!

What I wanted to say in short is that I agree with you in every way, I agree all is connected as we both say, and I agree we can disagree and have different path with same intention, and coexist, here on same website, in same community, on same planet in same dimension in same multiverse, in same eternity

Do not drink old stagnant water, even (and I should say especially) if it happens to not evaporate after two years from a small bowl. This suggestion is medically dangerous and could land people in the hospital, if not worse. Avoid this user's advice.

Yes, this can work as a cleansing, but there are also non-Christian options. Holy water is simply blessed water. You can bless the water yourself, or leave it in the moonlight for the same effect. You do not need to read psalms if you are not a Christian Witch, you can say a prayer to your deity, or a generic cleansing chant.

Please do not slur down christian accent in this practice, it is that way with a purpose, I respect your opinion and also I think there is a lot of other non christian options for those who want it that way

He wasn't. He said it works, but explained if you're not Christian, and still wish to use this, there are ways to alter it to suit your needs. He didn't say a single thing against Christianity, Christians, or Christian witches.

If I came across that way, I apologize. It was not my intention. This is a working cleansing, as I said. I simply wished to provide other options because some witches might feel they must cleanse their space with Christian prayers, when they do not resonate with that faith. Christianity is valid, as is Christian Witchcraft. Once again, I apologize if my comment was upsetting to you.

no no no, everything's fine! I'm just pointing out its not connected to the witchcraft, as you can see my other rituals, I explained that it works on whole another level, still, it is a way of spirituality, so I guess it has place here. that's why I'm here, and that's what I'm offering. As I said I'm sure there are tons of other ways of cleansing and protection, I only wish to offer something different

I am sorry to say, but this would be witchcraft. Witchcraft is a craft, not a religion. You are collecting items with a similar energy then channeling an energy source for aid with a goal. That is witchcraft. Calling on a deity is not necessary to witchcraft, but you can add a spiritual aspect to it. Since you are calling on Christian concepts, this would be Christian Witchcraft. It is the same as saying Christian knitting, knitting is the craft, Christian is the religion. If you do not agree with the term ''witchcraft'' you can call it something else, but that is the term. Also, I hope my tone is not combative, I am trying to explain witchcraft which can be a little tricky, so I hope I do not come across as argumentative. This is your path, you can call it whatever you wish, pray to whomever calls to you, and practice in any way that resonates with you. I am simply trying to define terms.

First of all, forgive my not so good English language, its not my native one. As I always say, symbols are only a way of manifesting higher reality, so yes, I would not use term ''witch'' for every and any spiritual craft you come upon, same with word ''magic'' coming from the Zend Avestan priests aka Magi, so, if we are up to the terminlogy, I would much rather use metaphysics which means that which comes after physics, and did you know that Aristotel originally wanted to call his work theology? Since, when you render this all down to the bare bone, it is all differing ways of theology, what I say is that I offer different way than witchcraft, but due to lack of basic understanding of metaphysics, one can confuse some spiritual practices with lower magical systems, invocations recitations, ritualistic behaviour, etc. First thing first is you must understand what lies behind, beyond - first thing to understand is what is your own ''I'', your own person your own ID, your very own soul? existential questions like that leads down the rabbit hole where that wall between You and I vanishes, and I see you as my other ''I'' be it incarnation once in an eternity, reincarnation, you are just my other ''I'', time itself is a simple construct, non existent, it is not a force, so in moment of that realization, that ''God'' is my, yours, ours higher ''I'', your higher self is that eternity. There is no higher religion than truth, and there is no higher truth than orthodox christianity, where everything and everyone gets to keep their own shape, beliefs, their own meaning of life, imbued by uncreated energies destined to live for eternity. That energies are called... Love. Love begins there, where all laws and rules and definitions and terms end, where you can be the one you want, you has and the one you are meant to be. Dont get me wrong, Im saying all of this just to clarify what are my beliefs, so you understand all of my nonsense, I love all that cozy witchy aesthetics, and believe me, I see such deep meaning in all of that which you talk about as a psychologist 2nd year student of theology and freshman of medical college. personally, Im interested in osteopathy neurolinguistics and psychonautics, if you are willing we can talk more via private messaging, Im very friendly and always open for discussion!

and by the way, Im glad to see this site alive, worry not, I think debates, commentaries and discussions are actually good for this community and even wider. There has been too much fluff, we need to rekindle the fires

I see your point. I will have to disagree with your belief that Orthodox Christianity is the one true path. I personally agree all paths lead to the same divine source. I believe my form of Wicca is the right path for me, but that does not mean it is the only path or that other people should follow my belief. When I state facts or terminology, that is different. 2+2=4 you can believe it is 5, but that is wrong. Believing we are all from the same energetic collective and we are all linked on a spiritual level I can agree with this.

whoops, I replied to the wrong comment, so here Im citing my misplaced reply: ''What I wanted to say in short is that I agree with you in every way, I agree all is connected as we both say, and I agree we can disagree and have different path with same intention, and coexist, here on same website, in same community, on same planet in same dimension in same multiverse, in same eternity''
