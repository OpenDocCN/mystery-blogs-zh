You cannot become a vampire.

Not going to ruin my dreams.

I do not intend to ''ruin your dreams'' merely give context of reality. Should you choose to dress like a vampire, behave as a vampire, work blood Magic and call on spiritual vampires, then go forth and live your life. Unfortunately Magic has limitations on the physical plane, mainly if it goes against nature Magic cannot do it. For this reason you cannot transform into a vampire, you were born human, and human you shall remain.
