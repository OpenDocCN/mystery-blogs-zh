# Breakup, Banish and Get Your Ex Back

  Rated 5/5 Stars

If you want your ex back but they're with a new partner, try this simple, but really powerful spell. It breaks up the relationship, banishes the other wo/man, and brings your ex to you if done correctly. This has really worked well for me. Bue beware of free will however! This spell works best if there's some feelings between you and your ex. But again, If you concentrate, this spell will still remove the other wo/man from the picture and banish them.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Breakup, Banish and Get Your Ex Back'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Sit in a meditative state until your mind is cleared of all disbelief, self-doubt and insecurities. You want to feel strong and confident in your manifestation. Make sure your intent is CLEAR. This should take no more then 5 minutes.

Stare at the picture of your target until that image of them is in your head clearly. Then close your eyes and visualize them being erased from the picture. You may also visualize their image catching on fire and turning to ash, being blown to the dirt of the earth. Say the following incantation:

"(First and last name of target) go away!
From (first ad last name of your love interest)you will stray.
By the 7th day,
you will be far away.
Leave (first and last name of target)to me.
This is my will, so mote it be."

Say this for 7 consecutive days, counting down the days each time you say it. (for example, tomorrow you will replace "by the 7th day" with "by the 6th day". then "5th day", "4th day", "3rd day", "2nd" or "next day" and "by today" for the final day.)

If your target is responsible for your breakup and you want revenge on top of it, then do this in the restroom and write their first and last name on a piece of toilet paper, then do the spell. Afterward wipe feces on the toilet paper and say "you're s#*t! You're life is s#*t!", and flush it down the toilet. Not only have you broken them up, and banished her/him, but you've also turned his/her life upside down. If you go more then once a day, then you can do this spell multiple times during the day too.

When you say leave to me did you really mean the target?

yeah, that got me confused as well, but...

Performed this spell two years ago, ex got back to me in 9 days. I didn't have an actual photo so instead I drew the person - it still worked.

My ex got back to me within two weeks

Update: he was just talking to me again. Now he has broken up with her and is fully committed to me.

I feel that it shouldn't be the target more like the love interest name should be in that spot

Trying this tonight. Hope it works. Fingers crossed will update.

Update day 9\. Nothing. :/.Guess I'll give it two weeks hoping something happens..

Made one week yesterday. Still nothing... :/

Update it's been 2 weeks NOTHING. sucks disappointed unless a miracle happens in the next few days... Guess I'll update if something does happen :/

What if you dont know the name of the other person?
