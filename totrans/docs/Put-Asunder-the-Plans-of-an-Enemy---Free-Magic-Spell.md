# Put Asunder the Plans of an Enemy

The following spell can be used to confound your enemies who would attempt to bring harm into your life. The type of enemy referenced would not be a mortal enemy, but this is the type of enemy who is trying to bring moderate harm into your life.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   White candle with stand

*   1 piece white typing paper

*   Red marker suitable for writing

*   Black marker suitable for writing

*   Psalm 70 (Can be read from the Bible or printed on a single page. The Psalm should be personalized, and if you have trouble doing this, refer to the modified version listed below.)

*   Bowl, non-flammable, or ashtray.

*   Table for items

*   A pair of scissors

*   Lighter or matches

## Casting Instructions for 'Put Asunder the Plans of an Enemy'

 Information: The Psalms have been used for centuries as tools to focus spiritual energy towards a specific goal. These sacred writings are believed to contain the breath of the Creator. And when these mystical words are combined with visualization and intent, magic happens. The power from the Psalms does not come from the items used. These items serve as visualization tools. The power comes from the Psalm itself and from your visualizations. 

Timing: This spell can be performed at any time.

Setting: The only consideration is that the spell should be performed in a quiet place where the caster will not be disturbed.
Duration: 30 to 45 minutes (However, there is no set minimum time.)

Ritual: Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. The position of your body is not important, but you want to be comfortable. You should be sitting in front of your table with your candle, in its holder, in front of you. The ashtray should be next to the candle. And Psalm 70 should be placed where you can read it. The rest of the items should be placed on the table as well, but off to the side.

Use the black magic maker to write your enemys name onto the white paper. You want to write the name small enough to be able to write the name 10 times on this sheet of paper. When you write the name, in black, draw a circle around the name with the red marker. The circles should be big enough just to encircle the name. The red symbolizes protection. Now, use the scissors to cut the red circled names out of the paper. You will now have 10 strips of paper with your enemys name on each strip. Dispose of the excess paper.

Light the white candle. The color of the candle symbolizes the purity and righteousness of your spell. As the candle is burning, slowly read the unedited version of Psalm 70, 10 times. Focus on what the words are saying.

Next, read the personalized version of Psalm 70, 10 times. Again, focus on what is being said. As you are reading, picture your enemy attempting to radiate harm to you, but that harm is being blocked, magnified, and then sent back to them. Picture Gods power flowing through you as you stop your enemys plans to harm you.

Last, repeat the modified version of Psalm 70\. After each reading, place one of the strips of paper into the candles flame, and set it into the ashtray. Burning the name symbolizes releasing the spell into the spiritual realm. Continues to visualize as before. When the last strip is burned, continue to recite the modified Psalm for 5 minutes or so. When the spell is complete, clean up your area. You can save the candle for additional uses.

Remember: Spells should be in the now. The spiritual reality creates the physical. And the spiritual reality exists before the physical. So, you should believe that your enemys plans to harm you have come back on him, when you are performing the spell. Do not believe after you have seen the manifestation of the spell. Believe that your spell has worked the moment that it was performed and as it was being performed.

Psalms 70

1.  Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.
2.  Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
3.  Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
4.  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
5.  But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
