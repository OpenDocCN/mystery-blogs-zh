Let the Funeral-Bells ring.

Write All capitals in bold as well as the commas and full stops put sing-song and ding-dong in bold.

Seal it in something like a bag, Then put it some where dark, or you rarely see it for example a curse candle or put a black pice of paper over it, and let the dark forces manifest in time, and when you think it is done burn it in a curse candle.

If you wish to undo this if there are Ashes left over off the curse candle burn the Ashes with a white candle and if there are no Ashes left over write I did not mean it on the seal or bag to put the Ashes in if you wish to chicken out write on the back of the picture I did not mean it in red and soak it in purification water or just normal water and Bury it some where

(Write exactly as I have or it might not work also be care full of what you wish for)

This is ALL WRITTEN BY ME so if you wish to repost it please credit me :)
