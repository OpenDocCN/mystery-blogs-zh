Will also work with other liquids, just change the water part of the blessing

felt my voice moving to my hands into my water dunno if that makes any sense

This should work, I would rework the chant, but this is a simple way to make blessed water.

I would remove the ''happen instantly'' part, but this seems like a simple chant to bring blessings into your life.
