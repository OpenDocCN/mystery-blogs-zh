# Another Vampire Spell. A Vampire Diaries Spell.

  Rated 5/5 Stars

this spell makes you a vampire like the ones from the vampire diaries. you burn in the sunlight unless you have some kind of ring on that'll protect you from the sun. you don't need a full moon it just has to be night or day but better effect at night.and good luck. and this spell is premenit once you turn there is no going back. side effects are: craving blood,fangs, throat hurting,belly hurts, tooth aches but nothing series.srry for my bad spelling.
