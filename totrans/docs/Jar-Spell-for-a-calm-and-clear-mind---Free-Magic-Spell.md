# Jar Spell for a calm and clear mind

There isn't really precise measurements, so do what feels right in that very moment.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Jar Spell for a calm and clear mind'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   -jar

*   -blueberries

*   -fern

*   -lavender essential oil

*   -orchid

*   -lepidolite (cleansed beforehand)

*   -honey or maple syrup

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   -jar

*   -blueberries

*   -fern

*   -lavender essential oil

*   -orchid

*   -lepidolite (cleansed beforehand)

*   -honey or maple syrup

 Cleanse the lepidolite  and you can then charge it if you'd like. I like to charge it with moonlight.

Next, take your jar and if you'd like, take this time to decorate it.

Put the lepidolite into the jar, slip a few pieces of fern inside, and then your orchid.

Now, fill with blueberries and 3-5 drops of lavender essential oil (depending on how big the jar is).

And fill with maple syrup (since it's cheaper, but you can for sure use honey) until it covers up everything inside.
