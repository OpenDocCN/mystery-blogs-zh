This is a type of cleansing. Roll the egg over the body, then crack the egg into a glass of water. The white should be murky because it absorbed the negative energy. Blood or black spots are also bad omens. You should feel lighter, calmer and possibly energized after cleansing.

Just a question, is the infusion mandatory?
