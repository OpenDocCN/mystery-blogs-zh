You cannot become a phoenix.

This spell is a lot of nonsense. You cannot physically change yourself with magic into something other than human.

How do you know your not the creator of magic therefore you know nothing of the sort and takashi you doubt every spell on here so I'm going to believe bgg in it

We understand magick because we've studied it [Tadashi, Lark, myself, and anyone else you see telling you certain spells don't work] Magick on the physical plane is a source of nature. It's ruled by nature and doesn't contradict nature. Humans by nature cannot go ''I want to be a phoenix'' then will themself to be one, which is why a spell will not make you one either. It isn't in our nature to do so. That said, you can work with phoenix energy, and other planes of existence have different laws surrounding magick. If you still don't believe those who wish to help pass on their knowledge to new members, that's fine. We're simply trying to help you avoid fake spells. [also, Tadashi doesn't doubt every spell, he's posted plenty of ''this spell works'' and ''if you change this point, the spell works'' comments too. People seem to focus on his comments on fake spells]
