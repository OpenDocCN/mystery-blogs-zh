## The World tarot card description

The World Tarot card is the twenty-first and final card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot. It is a card that symbolizes completion, fulfillment, and the attainment of all that one has been working towards.

In most traditional Tarot decks, the World card is depicted as a woman, often naked or semi-naked, dancing within a wreath or ring of flowers or vines.

 The woman is usually shown as standing on one leg, with the other leg raised and bent at the knee. She is often holding a wand or staff in one hand, and in the other hand, she may be holding a ribbon or cord that is tied to the wreath.

The wreath is typically depicted as a circle, which is a symbol of unity, wholeness, and infinity.

 The woman on the World card is often depicted as being surrounded by four animals: a lion, an eagle, a bull, and an angel. These four animals represent the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water, respectively.

 They are also often associated with the four evangelists in the Christian tradition: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

 In the background of the World card, there is often a landscape depicted, which may include mountains, rivers, forests, and other natural features. This is meant to represent the entire world and the interconnectedness of all things.

Overall, the World Tarot card is a symbol of achievement and success, signifies a point of completion and is ready to move on to new challenges and endeavors.

 It is a card that encourages one to celebrate their accomplishments and to continue to strive for growth and development.

### Astrology of the World card

In some Tarot decks, the World card is associated with the astrological sign of Saturn. Saturn is a planet that is associated with structure, discipline, and responsibility. It is also associated with the passage of time, and with the lessons and experiences that we gain as we age.

 The association of the World card with Saturn suggests that the attainment of success and completion represented by the card may come through hard work, dedication, and a willingness to take on responsibility and make sacrifices.

It also suggests that the lessons and experiences gained through this process will be valuable and enduring, helping to shape and guide their future endeavors.

It is worth noting that not all Tarot decks make an astrological association for the World card, and in some decks, the card may be associated with different astrological symbols or themes.

 It is always a good idea to consult the specific symbolism and associations of a particular Tarot deck when interpreting the cards.

## Upright World tarot card meaning

What is the meaning of the upright World card?

**The upright World Tarot card signifies accomplishment and success and suggests a point of completion or fulfillment. It also indicates a new phase of life marked by unity, wholeness, and interconnectedness. This card is a positive and hopeful one.**

 The traditional meaning of the upright World Tarot card is one of accomplishment and success.

 It suggests a point of completion or fulfillment in some aspect of their life and is now ready to move on to new challenges and opportunities. This may be the culmination of a long and difficult journey, or it may be the realization of a long-held goal or dream.

The World card is a celebration of achievements and a recognition of the hard work and dedication that has gone into reaching this point. It is a time to take stock of all that has been accomplished and to savor the sense of accomplishment and success.

 The World card also suggests entering a new phase of their life, one that is marked by a sense of unity, wholeness, and interconnectedness. This may involve a greater sense of connection to the world around them, or it may involve a greater sense of self-awareness and understanding of their place in the world.

 Overall, the upright World card is a positive and hopeful card, indicating they are poised for success and ready to move forward into a new and exciting phase of their life.

### Example upright World reading

Here is an example of a real-world reading using the upright World card:

 Imagine that you have been working for many years to complete your degree and become a nurse. After much hard work and dedication, you finally graduate and pass your nursing exams.

 In a Tarot reading, the upright World card might appear as a representation of this accomplishment and success. It would suggest that you have reached a point of completion in your studies and are now ready to move on to the next phase of your career as a nurse.

The World card would also indicate that this is a time to celebrate your achievements and to take pride in all that you have accomplished.

 It would encourage you to look forward with hope and optimism to the new opportunities and challenges that lay ahead and to continue to strive for growth and development in your career.

 ## Reversed World card tarot meaning

What is the meaning of the reversed World tarot card?

**The reversed World Tarot card means delays, setbacks, and a lack of completion. It can also suggest a lack of purpose or direction and a feeling of disconnection from the world.**

 The traditional meanings and interpretations of the reversed World Tarot card often center on themes of disruption, delay, and lack of completion.

 When this card appears reversed in a reading, it can suggest experiencing delays or setbacks in their plans or goals, and that they may be feeling a sense of frustration or disappointment as a result.

 The reversed World card may also indicate struggling to find a sense of purpose or direction in their life. They may feel disconnected from the world around them or may be struggling to understand their place in the larger scheme of things.

 In this sense, the reversed World card can be a sign of disunity, fragmentation, and a lack of wholeness.

 Overall, the reversed World card is a more negative and challenging card than the upright version. It can indicate facing obstacles or challenges that are preventing them from achieving their goals or moving forward in their life.

 However, it is important to remember that this card is not necessarily a sign of failure or hopelessness. Rather, it may simply indicate that the querent needs to take a step back, reassess their situation, and find a new way to move forward.

 ### Example reversed World reading

Imagine that you have been working for several years to start your own business. You have put a lot of time, effort, and resources into getting your business off the ground, but despite your best efforts, things have not been going as smoothly as you had hoped.

There have been delays, setbacks, and unexpected challenges that have made it difficult for you to move forward.

 In a Tarot reading, the reversed World card might appear as a representation of this struggle and frustration. It would suggest that you are experiencing delays or disruptions in your plans and that you may be feeling a sense of disappointment or despair as a result.

 The reversed World card may also indicate that you are struggling to find a sense of purpose or direction in your business and that you may be feeling disconnected from the larger world of commerce and industry.

 While the reversed World card is a more negative and challenging card than the upright version, it is important to remember that it is not necessarily a sign of failure or hopelessness.

 Rather, it may simply indicate that you need to take a step back, reassess your situation, and find a new way to move forward. It may be helpful to seek the advice and guidance of others or to consider new strategies or approaches to achieving your goals.

## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the World card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

 Here is a new interpretation of the World Tarot card:

In a world that is increasingly interconnected and globalized, the World card may take on a new meaning that reflects these trends.

 In this interpretation, the World card could symbolize the interconnectedness and interdependence of people and systems around the world. It could suggest being an important part of a larger whole, and that their actions and choices have an impact on the world beyond their immediate surroundings.

In this interpretation, the World card could also be seen as a call to consider the wider implications of one’s actions, and to think about how they fit into the bigger picture. It could be a reminder to think globally and to consider the long-term consequences of one’s choices.

 This modern interpretation of the World card could be particularly relevant in times of crisis or change.

 The woman dancing within the wreath on the World card could represent the idea of celebrating and honoring the diversity and interconnections of the global community.

The four animals that surround her (the lion, eagle, bull, and angel) could symbolize the different cultures, beliefs, and experiences that make up this global community.

 This interpretation of the World card could encourage us to consider their place in the larger world and to think about how they can contribute to the greater good.

 It could also encourage a sense of openness and acceptance towards others, and a willingness to learn and grow through encounters with different cultures and ways of life.
