> 来源：[https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/life_spells/growing_spells/9159/page.html#0001-01-01](https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/life_spells/growing_spells/9159/page.html#0001-01-01)

 Draw a circle on the floor with chalk or something else. Make sure it is big enough to store yourself and your altar. Put all of your ingredients on the alter, arranging them however you want. Purify the circle with sea salt.

Face East, holding the yellow candle. Light the candle and say, "Hail Guardians of the East. I summon the powers of Air! Windswept meadow, breath of life, fantastic torrent removing strife, with clarity, the power to know, I invoke you!" Set the candle on the floor on the edge of the circle and say, "By the Air that is Her breath, be with me now." Draw the symbol for Air above the candle. If you don't know what that is, then here is a link to a picture that shows all of the elements' symbols: http://occult-advances.org/images/j.jpg

Now, face South, holding the red candle. Light the candle and say, "Hail Guardians of the South. I summon the powers of Fire! Blazing flame, crackling fire, the quickened pulse of heart's desire, with energy, the power of will, I invoke you!" Place the candle at the edge of the circle on the floor and say, "By the Fire that is Her spirit, be with me now." Draw the symbol of fire above the candle.

Face the West now, holding the blue candle. Light the candle and say, "Hail Guardians of the West. I summon the powers of Water!Rushing stream, vast, dark ocean, poetry of the soul in motion, with intuition, feeling, the power to dare, I invoke you!" Set the candle on the floor at the edge of the circle and say, "By the Waters of Her womb and by the Water that is Her blood, be with me now." Draw the symbol for water over the candle.

Face North, holding the green candle. Light it and say, "Hail Guardians of the North. I summon the powers of Earth! Cave of darkness, standing stone, the celebration of flesh and bone, with stillness, the power of silence, I invoke you!" Place the candle on the floor at the Northern part of the circle and say, "By the Earth that is Her body, be with me now." Draw the symbol for Earth over the candle. Now, move to the center of your circle where your altar should be.

Light the purple candle in the center of your altar and say, "As above, so below. As within, so without. Four stars in this place be, combined to call the fifth to me. Circumfrence and center, woven together, to make the circle complete!" Draw a pentagram over the candle.
Now, walk around your circle three times, clockwise, beginning from the East. Once you make it back to the East after your third time, say, "This circle is closed. Imagine a sphere forming around your circle, going deep into the ground and sky, combining both. Now, you are ready to preform the spell.

Grab the White Sage Smudge Stick and light it, fanning the smoke around yourself. You might want to do this outside so you won't set off any alarms. As you fan both your back and front, think cleansing, peaceful thoughts. Let the feeling of peace and tranquility consume you as the smoke purifies you. Let the smoke fan around the circle as well. When you and your circle are cleansed, set the smudge stick next to the yellow candle or just put it out. Light the lavender incense and let it burn.

Smell the aroma of the lavender and allow it to calm you. In the center of your altar, next to the purple candle, place the pink candle. Place the pearls/pink rose petals around it. Light the candle, saying, "I invoke the Goddess Aphrodite. With her, may she bring the power to love. Aphrodite, please accept these pearls/rose petals, as they are a gift to you."

Now, grab the white and black candles, setting them before the pink candle. Light the black candle, saying, "This candle represents all of the hardships I have been through. This candles holds me back and keeps me from love. It blocks my healing. It is the fear within me, and the fear must be extinguished." Now, take the time to tell the candle all of the hardships you have been through in life. This could be deaths, break-ups, or bad luck. When you have finished telling the flame all of the bad things, then put it out with your fingers. (Lick them before you do it so you won't get burned.) DO NOT BLOW THE CANDLE OUT. It takes the magick away with it. Besides, you will deeply offend the element Fire.

Now, light the white candle and say, "This candle represents the healing that is to come. This represents the future happiness and calm that I will feel. It is the sun rising, the light in the darkness, and my hope. May it burn in my heart." Now, grab the bowl of water and put some sea salt in it, saying, "I purify this water." Pour some of the white candle's wax into the bowl. After this is done, say, "The true flame burns within me." Then, put out the white candle's flame with your fingers. If you're a pansy, then use something else to snuff it out with.

Focus on the pink candle again and say, "Aphrodite, Goddess of Love and Beauty. Please bring beauty into my life and fill me with love." Now, talk about all of your desires and hopes into the candle. When you are done, pour some of the pink wax into the water. Then say, "Goddess Aphrodite, thank you for your time. I will hold you no longer. Please accept my gratitude." Snuff out the candle's flame.

Now, take the bowl of water and say, "Water heal me and mold me. Turn me into the person I want to be." Dip your fingers in the water and draw a pentagram on your forehead with it.
Walk three times around your circle, counter-clockwise, and when you get to East after your third time, say, "The circle is open but not broken." Go to the center of your circle and take your purple candle. Say, "Spirit, thank you for your wholeness and completion in tonight's circle. Please depart, but leave in peace and beauty."

Snuff out the candle. Go to the North and grab your green candle. Pick it up and say, "Earth, thank you for your strength and guidance in tonight's circle. Please depart, but leave in peace and beauty." Snuff out the candle. Go to the West and grab the blue candle. Say, "Water, thank you for your healing and peace in tonight's circle. Please depart, but leave in peace and beauty." Snuff out the candle. Go to the South and grab the red candle. Say, "Fire, thank you for your passion and energy in tonight's circle. Please depart, but do it in peace and beauty." Snuff out the candle. Go to the East and grab the yellow candle. Say, "Air, thank you for your intellect and bravery in tonight's circle. Please depart, but do it in love and beauty."

Clean up all of your things and then grab the rose petals/pearls and bury them beneath a tree or toss them into running water. This ends the spell. Remember, though, that a spell does not work alone. You should not expect this to welcome love into your life if you lock yourself up in a room. You need to go out and begin to talk to people, begin to have fun, and begin to forget. Magick can only work if we believe in it and help it. Thank you.
