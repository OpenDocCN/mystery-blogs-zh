## Benefits of Witchy Coloring Pages

### Relaxation

With the proliferation of adult coloring books these days, it’s no surprise that witch coloring pages would be a great way to jump on the trend.

 People use coloring pages as a way to relax. Some might work on a coloring page at the end of the day to unwind, and some might complete one over the weekend as a [de-stressing](https://www.wiccangathering.com/wiccan-meditation-for-anxiety/) activity.

 Likewise, you might enjoy refreshing your mind with a coloring page that reflects your mystical and witchy side.

### Enhance Your Book of Shadows

A new use for Wiccan coloring pages has emerged, which is a way to enhance your grimoire.

 Alongside your meticulous notes and spells, you can place a beautiful and bright Wiccan coloring page that you’ve completed.

 Even if you’re not an artist, they may inspire you to start creating your own drawings in your grimoire.

Your Book of Shadows is not just a record of all that you’ve learned on your path– it’s a source of inspiration, creativity, and positivity! So Wiccan coloring pages make a perfect addition.

 ### Have Child-like Fun

Coloring brings us back to a simpler time. We don’t need to worry about adult concerns such as how good it looks or whether we are coloring inside the lines.

 Witch coloring pages are an innocent way to just have fun. Choose whatever colors make you feel good. Imagine the coloring scene is real. Focus on the shapes, dimensions, and textures.

Grow your imagination while doing this simple and pure activity!

### Incorporate in Your Self-Care

Life for most of us is busy-busy-busy. We schedule too much into our days, and make a point to plan everything to a T.

 Wiccan coloring pages make a perfect [self-care](https://www.wiccangathering.com/wiccan-meditation/) activity. They require few supplies, can be done anywhere, and involve focus and concentration.

 Here are some ideas to nudge your Wiccan coloring into a self-care activity:

 *   Find a quiet space
*   Listen to some music*   Use the time to reflect and regroup*   Concentrate on the physical act of coloring– the delicate coordination of your fingers*   Focus on the image itself– the borders, the curves, the shapes*   Lose yourself in the act of coloring
