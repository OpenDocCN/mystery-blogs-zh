# Moon-Jupiter Aspects In The Synastry Chart | Tea & Rosemary

> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/moon-jupiter-aspects-synastry-2/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/moon-jupiter-aspects-synastry-2/#0001-01-01)

We see our deepest emotional needs embodied in the natal Moon. The lunar domain encompasses security, comfort, warmth, nurturing, and receptivity.

Jupiter stands for amplification, elevation, protection, and magnification. From the highest and most inspiring peaks to the depths of gluttony, exaggeration, and overindulgence, Jupiter’s archetype expands whatever it touches.

## Moon Conjunct Jupiter Synastry

The Moon conjunct Jupiter synastry aspect indicates overindulgence. Neither partner can get enough of the other. This energy usually manifests in a positive way, with a sense of admiration between both partners.

Sometimes, the Moon conjunct Jupiter synastry aspect also indicates that both partners will feel protective over each other, with the Moon person being especially protective of Jupiter.

The Jupiter individual can be very motivating in this relationship. Jupiter lifts the Moon up and teaches the Moon about their own emotions. However, Jupiter expands *all* the emotions of the Moon person, so the Moon may feel especially self-conscious around Jupiter during certain times, even if they’re normally not. In a good, healthy relationship, the Jupiter person can help the Moon work through these feelings.

Meanwhile, the Moon can provide stable, steady affection to the Jupiter person. For the Jupiter person, the Moon conjunct Jupiter synastry relationship can be a very stable place to land. The Moon person also supports their new ideas, beliefs, and passions.

Both partners have the potential to make the other feel good. This is a true heartfelt relationship where each can openly share their feelings, at least in the sign of the Moon conjunct Jupiter conjunction. There is a lot of positive energy in this relationship that allows for vulnerability. Jupiter especially can help the Moon person come out of their shell.

The positive energy that exists between the Moon and Jupiter allows them to be vulnerable to one another, and improve their weaknesses through the help of their partner.  There is confidence and joy in the relationship. Jupiter helps pull the Moon out of their shell or boost their self-esteem.

## Moon Trine Jupiter Synastry

The Moon trine Jupiter synastry relationship is associated with risks, particularly emotional risks. The relationship may feel somewhat unsafe for the Moon person, as though they have the potential of being hurt by ever-expansive Jupiter.

Commitment is a bit tricky in this relationship, usually (but not always) for Jupiter, who rarely wants to commit completely. Even if this is not said out loud, the Moon person may *feel* Jupiter pull away.

The Moon trine Jupiter synastry relationship can grow *very* quickly, because the feelings are so good at first, leading to rose-colored glasses. Theirs is a very intense, dopamine-driven relationship.

It is also an emotionally adventurous relationship. Especially for the Moon but also for Jupiter, there is always a new adventure to be had. This can be good because it’s new and exciting, but also difficult, especially for the Moon who always wants safety and security. It’s important that the Moon trine Jupiter synastry couple finds a balance between adventure and stability.

If this couple can cultivate trust and openness, then this aspect can be both safe *and* exciting. This depends not only on the signs of the Moon trine Jupiter synastry aspect but also on how much trust can be built and on how willing Jupiter is to “settle down” and show true loyalty.

Both planets are quite optimistic in the trine so this can be a wonderfully adventurous relationship on the physical *or* mental levels. In fact, the relationship can feel almost otherworldly yet still fun.

## Moon Sextile Jupiter Synastry

The Moon sextile Jupiter synastry relationship is emotionally adventurous. These two feel passionate and thrilling together, but it can also be a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. At the very least, both partners act more emotional *together* than alone.

Theirs is a fun and expansive relationship. The Moon sextile Jupiter synastry aspect is certainly never boring! However, these emotions can feel *overwhelming*.

These partners have an *opportunity* to learn about managing their emotions through this relationship. At first, there may be both emotional highs and lows. As they expand their emotional knowledge and learn how to explain what they feel, the relationship will become more balanced.

## Moon Opposition Jupiter Synastry

The Moon opposition Jupiter synastry aspect indicates that there is a clash in beliefs. The Jupiter person may not understand what the Moon thinks, feels, or expresses, so they cannot agree with the Moon’s decisions. Theirs is a moral or belief-related conflict.

The Moon person might either try to smother the Jupiter person *or* they may grow detached. This will depend on the sign and placement of the Moon, since this is an emotional reaction to Jupiter’s beliefs or culture, which the Moon person cannot understand. They may also try to change the Jupiter person.

Sometimes, the Moon opposite Jupiter synastry aspect indicates that both people feel like the other is a “bad influence,” or that they tend to make bad choices together, mainly because this energy is amplified in the relationship.

Both people see things they hate about *themselves* in the other. This can cause arguments. Generally, fights between the Moon and Jupiter with the opposite aspect are *explosive* and can be overly emotional. Mood swings can cause tension in the relationship.

With the Moon opposition Jupiter synastry aspect, it’s important that the couple learns how to control the emotional volatility of the relationship, or else it’ll eventually collapse. They each need to manage their emotions in specific ways. They must not let their emotions control them or cloud their judgment. Ultimately, it’s important to use both emotions and logic to manage the energy of this relationship.

## Moon Square Jupiter Synastry

The Moon square Jupiter synastry aspect indicates exaggeration. There is a tendency for each partner to support the other’s “worst attributes” and even encourage them. While they are not especially critical of each other (which can create a lovely non-judgmental attitude here), they can be overly encouraging of more negative behaviors.

In this relationship, Jupiter is especially like to encourage the moon in both “good” and “bad” endeavors. There is little discernment. 

Sometimes, the Moon square Jupiter synastry relationship is an emotional roller coaster. The highs and lows of this partnership can be extreme. The Moon person may not understand when Jupiter is being overly expansive or doing things that the Moon person doesn’t think are necessary. They could feel that the Jupiter person jumps to quickly or puts themselves in danger. Meanwhile, the Jupiter person can see the Moon person as too careful or restrictive. It’s important that they come back to Earth and learn how to see things from each other’s perspectives. Otherwise, this can result in very emotional arguments. 

The Moon square Jupiter synastry relationship *can* be really beautiful. If both partners work to see each other’s perspectives (some of which must be taken on faith – they’re *so* different) then they can experience a deeper understanding of both each other and themselves through this partnership.
