The Midheaven (MC) and the Imum coeli (IC) are two opposite points in astrology that are calculated based on your place and time of birth. The IC shows the qualities that you learned in childhood and the environment that you wanted to escape.

In order to get away from the values of the IC, you push towards the Midheaven. In fact, the Midheaven is how people tend to perceive you in the outer world, but more specifically in your career. Although you may embrace the qualities of your Midheaven, the IC always exists underneath.

The IC in Taurus placement is all about living by *other* people’s values in childhood. As an adult with Midheaven in Scorpio, you seek to individuate and figure out what’s real for *you*.

Keep in mind that the Midheaven and IC are always opposite signs, so you can’t have one without the other.

## IC In Taurus:

With your IC in Taurus, you lived with “set in their ways” types of parents. In some manner, your parents were very traditional. They followed a certain set of rules and may have employed black and white thinking.

However, this also means that in these specific way, your home life was stable. You knew that certain things wouldn’t change. IC In Taurus manifests differently for everyone, but there were at least *some* constant things about your childhood.

Most likely, your parents lived by societal rules in some manner. They were traditional and created a clear set of boundaries that you needed to follow as a child.

IC in Taurus also means that you probably felt misunderstood with your family at times. It might have seemed that everyone else fit into the mold, but you felt different.

At times, you felt that you couldn’t express the deepest part of you because you had to stick to the family structure. You didn’t have the freedom to completely be yourself.

You parents or caretakers deeply influenced your childhood with their *own* set of values. In certain areas, you weren’t allowed to explore or develop your own set of values. Instead, you were expected to believe what your parents taught you.

This created a very structured sort of childhood. You couldn’t deviate from the norm, or you would be punished and looked down upon. 

Although your parents were headstrong and set in their ways with IC in Taurus, you were probably just as bullheaded. This might have caused some issues because neither side would back down during fights.

However, you may have also learned some positive lessons about strength from your childhood. Now, you probably have stubborn personality pieces, too.

Ultimately, there were no exceptions in your childhood. You had to follow the rules regardless of how you fel.

With your IC in Taurus, you didn’t feel that you could negotiate or explain your side.  You felt like you had no power, though you definitely tried to exert yourself.

You may have also felt that you needed to earn your parents love in some way. You may have felt that you were deserving of love because of what you *did*, not because of who you were.

In both cases, the IC in Taurus leaves you feeling inauthentic. You had to follow the demands of someone else, even when they conflicted with your own personal beliefs.

## Midheaven In Scorpio:

Now, with your Midheaven in Scorpio, you start to reevaluate your values and compare your beliefs to those of your parents. You were never given the opportunity to develop your own self of morals, so the values that you *do* come up with might be the exact opposite of your parents’ morals in some ways.

As an adult, you may feel a lot of resentment towards your parents’ values. You were restricted in childhood and hold a lot of deep anger over these experiences.

It’s important that you work *with* this intensity. This is how you will dig deep and discover what matters to you, and your own values will probably shape your career.

You may come off as dark or tortured, or even seem like an enigma. However, this is important to you because you feel strongly about representing your deep self. You want to be nothing less than truthful, no matter how dark or twisty the truth is.

In your career and public image with Midheaven in in Scorpio, you specifically try to show the parts of you that appear deep and interesting. You want to be seen as someone profound, contrasting with the surface level rules and values you were taught in childhood.

Your appearance sparks intrigued. Something about the way you come off is dark and complicated, so people are drawn to you and want to learn more about what’s inside.

However, you don’t reveal *all* of your depth with Midheaven in Scorpio. You’re careful to curate an image that displays your best qualities so that you won’t be attacked.

You may also like being a little mysterious because you learned that there’s power in mystery.

In your work, you want to create or uncover something profound. Midheaven in Scorpio is all about contributing something important to the world. You will never settle for surface level work.

With Midheaven in Scorpio, you’re also attracted to power, as with any Scorpio placement. This is because you felt powerless as a child, so you want to appear important now. Power can become your safety net.

You’re hungry and ambitious, so you can be very successful in your career. Once you put your mind to something, you won’t stop until you achieve it.

However, your career *must* mean something to you. You work *has* to be an expression of who you are and must reflect your authentic values.

Keep in mind that with Midheaven in Scorpio, you *can* grow to possess unhealthy power, *or* this Scorpionic influence can be transmitted for good, helping you make an impact on the world.

Work to wield your power wisely. Don’t get caught in the dark and depressive elements of Midheaven in Scorpio, but instead discover your *truest* values and use them to shape the world around you.

Ultimately, you don’t ever want to earn love or have to play by other people’s rules. You desire to do what you want, when you want, and find people who accept this.

To heal your inner child with Midheaven in Scorpio, release the hangups you have that don’t serve you. Learn how to be authentic without needing to control the situation or prove anything to other people.

Instead, when you heal your inner child, you will show your truest, authentic self without reservation or fear.
