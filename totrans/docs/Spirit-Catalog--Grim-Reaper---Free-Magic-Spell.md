We have encountered this spirit once as it took away an evil soul, it is truly a powerful and almighty spirit, it is impossible to seal. Though this spirit is extremely powerful, it is not dangerous the Grim Reaper will not disturb you if you do not disturb it, it follows guidelines and performs its duties.
