Magick Mirror Of Spirit Summoning

STEP 1: Prepare a dimly lighted room in the evening. Put on some of your favorite ''mystical'' music. Really set the mood.

STEP 2: Light a white or silver candle on your altar.

STEP 3: Say, ''I sit here before the spirits with intent to make contact. I humbly ask for angelic blessings from the beyojnd.''

STEP 4: Sit, relax, and burn Frankincense... extend and invitation with your thoughts to the spirits beyond.

STEP 5: Run a small mirror through the smoke.

STEP 6: Gaze into the mirror by the light of the candle. Pretend it's not ''you'' in the mirror, but someone else.

STEP 7: Next, look ''past'' yourself. As if your reflection isn't there at all... look ''beyond'' the reflection. This may take a minute or 2 to accomplish.

STEP 8\. Stay relaxed... if you are tense this won't work.

Only work for as long as you feel refreshed and relaxed. Several attempts may be necessary before you actually see hints of a spirit looking back at you in the mirror.

STEP 9: You may see a new face, and eventually you may see your guardian angel or other spirit behind your own image. You may see lights... Keep in mind the experience will always be different, and it's very personal.

STEP 10: Try to communicate with your thoughts (and some simple words) with the presence in your mirror.

STEP 11: When you're done, wrap the mirror in dark silk or velvet and reserve it for this ritual alone.

Blessed be
