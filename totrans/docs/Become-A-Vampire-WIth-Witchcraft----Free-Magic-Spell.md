 Take a piece of paper and make a pentagram on it and place it on the floor and then place the picture in the middle of the pentagram and say lay the butter knife beside the picture and say this chant one time.

"Vampires one and vampires all I wish to be a vampire. I shall be uncontrollable, I shall go crazy for blood, I shall become a vampire. I shall burn in the sunlight. It shall leave marks on my skin. I shall no longer have a soul, I shall not be able to control myself, I shall be a vampire. I shall have pale skin. I shall become what it is that I want to become. I drag to hell which comes to a bell. God of hell I ask for you to make me a vampire. I shall die and be reborn but not as a human but as a vampire. (Now take the knife and stab the picture one time) Now I have died and been reborn but not as a human but as a vampire. Now I have rejected my soul. I shall live forever without ever ageing. I shall be forever more frozen at the age of thirteen. So make this me."

Say that chant one time and when you go to bed and you wake up you will be a vampire

Side effects are: Dizziness, headaches, blood thirsts, bellyaches, children that you give birth to. and that's pretty much it.
