# To Ward off un-wanted spirits

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This spell only works for hostile spirits, which may torment you or cause you harm. It will not work on good spirits.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'To Ward off un-wanted spirits'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A bundle of Sage

*   A small saucer or bowl

*   Salt (sea salt works best)

*   Purified water (The more pure, the better)

*   One White Candle

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A bundle of Sage

*   A small saucer or bowl

*   Salt (sea salt works best)

*   Purified water (The more pure, the better)

*   One White Candle

Start off by of course purifying yourself. Everyone has their own way of purifying themselves but I would suggest creating a source of light around you with energy. This is because hostile spirits will try their best to stop you from doing your duty. So, after you are purified and your mind is clear on the task at hand, burn the bundle of sage. Wave the bundle of sage gently at each corner of the effected area, allow the smoke to creep in and drive out the spirits. Once all the corners have been purified, you may extinguish the bundle of sage. Next, go to each corner (which has been sagged) and sprinkle a pinch of salt. Now, take your saucer(s) and pour equal amounts of salt and water inside. Place the saucer/bowl under neath a bed, chair, couch, or stand (underneath something that is in use a lot), this works as a one-way portal to keep hostile spirits at bay and keeps your space clean. Last! Light the white candle and set in an area where it won't catch anything on fire. Concentrate on the flame and cast this spell:

''Beings of Light, far and wide,
This spell I cast shall not un-tie,
With Sage, Salt, Water, and Light,
I banish this evil from my sight''
- Blessed Be
Now let the candle burn it's self out. The saucers of water should evaporate into the air at a certain amount of time, once that is done you may remove them as well (that can take weeks) but your space is just clean. Letting the water evaporate is more of an insurance policy.

NOTE: Remember, any spirits that remain are not harmful to you so do not try to expel them, consequences may come.
