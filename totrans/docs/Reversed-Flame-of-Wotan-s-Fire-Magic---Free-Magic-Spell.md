This be also under Wotan should you need. The Reversed Flame- let the enemy take heed! As Luna dwindles and hides Her face. On Wotan's Day seek out a dark place. With Bolline blade shave a white taper at the bottom end onto the black paper. By lighting at the reversed end, curses and hexes right back you send. Let the wax drip onto the paper of color black, as you mutter these words to send evil back.
FACE OF THE CURSER. FACE OF MY FOE,
APPEAR IN THE WAX.
YOUR DARK COUNTENANCE SHOW.

Let the was drop silent and slow, as you hold it reversed and upon the paper blow. See the curser's face in the wax, while your cold breath their capacity doth tax. When you feel yourself free from harm, Snuff the candle out in the wax to seal the charm.

im new to something like this, but this sounds magical.

I do not practice Germanic Paganism, so please explain if this has some cultural context. This appears to be a ritualized divination to see who cursed you. I would not try this if you do not follow a Germanic path, but using divination to determine if someone cast on you and who is wise. If you plan to cast a reversal, you should know your exact target.
