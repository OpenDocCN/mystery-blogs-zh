# Avian spell ( prayer) made4fun

This goes with my avian mentality meditation. This gives you wings. I did this completely for fun and I don't intend for it to work. So don't comment and hate that is either not possible or didn't work. Still in testing. Message me if it worked tho that would be very intetesting.

 Start by mediating and relax. Drink your water to calm yourself even further if necessary. After this is done. Chant the following:

Hello one (s) above me. There is a wish I want most granted. Please let me grow a pair of wings, big, broad and fit for me. I do believe that this will work. I wish to fly above the clouds to protect the birds. To keep r the wind from my face. Please. This is my wish. So mote it be.

This is more of a prayer but again don't hate in the comments cause this ain't real I made it for fun!

You cannot grow physical wings. Not hating on you, just stating facts.

Did u not see the made for fun part

Yes. It is also clearly stated in my profile what I am doing, what is your point? This site is for real witches to discuss Real Magik and real witchcraft. The line about entertainment in the legal section is to protect the owner. I comment on all spells that are posted to this site, regardless of if they were indented for fun or not. I have seen you recently arguing with members who actually understand Magik and witchcraft, and looking at your posts on the site, I would suggest you listen to those members, you might learn something about Real Magik and not Hogwarts nonsense.
