**You will need the following items for this spell:**

Sit alone in a quiet, dimly lit room. Make sure you are comfortable and think of ONE person who you want to forget. Concentrate on this person entirely and nobody else otherwise it will likely not work.
When you have full concentration chant this 3 times;
''Remove this person from my mind,
from existence of all time
be he far or be he near
remove this person that is here.''

After the third time take a deep breath and say ''So mote it be.''
To ensure it has worked do not try and think about that person.
