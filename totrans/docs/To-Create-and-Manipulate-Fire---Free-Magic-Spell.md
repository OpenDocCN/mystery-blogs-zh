# To Create and Manipulate Fire

This spell will let you create and manipulate fire. However, you won?t be able to manipulate natural occurring fire, only that which you have created. This spell works best if you are a natural born fire element or your star sign is a fire element (Sagittarius, Leo, or Aries).

 ## Casting Instructions for 'To Create and Manipulate Fire'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A piece of jewellery representing fire, like a ring or a necklace

*   A semi/precious stone that represents fire, like obsidian (optional, but can be in place of jewellery if you don?t have it)

*   Your voice

*   Belief

*   Spiritual balance

*   A lot of concentration

*   Your voice

*   Belief

*   Spiritual balance

*   A lot of concentration

 Before you begin, find a place where there are little to no flammable things around. While you should theoretically be able to control the flame... better safe than sorry. Also, you shouldn’t cast this spell unless you are an experienced sorcerer/sorceress. If you are inexperienced in the practice of magic, you are more likely to accidentally let your emotions get in the way of your control over the magic. If that happens, the effects could be disastrous.

While wearing your piece of jewellery or holding the stone (if you’re using a ring, bracelet, or holding a stone, have it on or in your non-power hand - this creates balance in the magic), chant the following spell:

“Fire burn, embers rise; ash and smoke, fill the skies.”

Once you have created the flame, concentrate on making it into the shape you wish, or making it act in the way you wish. If you are having trouble, try reciting the following:

”Flame of mine, will of mine, become the same and intertwine.”

Have fun, but BE CAREFUL!!

WARNING: If you intentionally hurt someone with this spell, because the fire isn’t natural, the victim’s soul will most likely be destroyed and when they die, they will become a malevolent spirit - in other words, hell bent on revenge against you and everyone you love.

Magic doesn't allow you to create fire out of thin air nor manipulate it, that's not how spells work.
