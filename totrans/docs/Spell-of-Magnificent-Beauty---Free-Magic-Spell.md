**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 Green apple if for job interview or

*   3 Gold apple if for public impression.

*   3 avocado

*   21 cherries

*   21 snow peas

Cut an apple in half horizontally and you should see the star. Visualize yourself glowing like a star. Eat half the apple, and give the rest of it as an offering, outdoors under a tree.

Peel the skin off the avocado. Imagine your negative traits peeling off of you, including any negativity your mind has towards any part of yourself. Slice the fruit into 7 pieces, and remove the pit. Mash the slices into a paste, and use as a face mask. Visualize all your blemishes disappearing.

Now take 7 snow peas in your right hand, and 7 cherries in your left. Eat them alternately. Left hand rules the subconscious, unseen world, and the right hand rules the conscious seen world, thus you are making yourself beautiful inside and out.

Do this 1-3 days before you intend to strut your stuff.
If you want to use all three types of apples; use red on the first day, green for the second, and gold on the third.
