Sacred stone or purple true
Wake my sight and please embue
With sight of past and future vision
To help all those with tough decisions
Growing stronger with each hour
Both sacred strength and sacred power
At the flicker of this candle's last burn
The visions I seek and secrets I will learn.
When I wake I shall remember only what is important and the small shall not dwell
So I will have no confusion and my brain will not swell.

Place the amethyst at the foot of the candle and let the candle burn out. When the candle has burned out place the amethyst under your pillow. (The Candle must burn out completely. . . . . . no cheating)
