put on lipliner on lips completely covering lips with black lip liner (they cost a dollar at beauty shops/isles)

put lip liner around eyelids and eyes surrounding around an inch from eyelids (smudge until completely black with faded outer edges)

wear black clothes 

Afterwards say, "Faith Ontoethe Me Satan! Immortal Be Ontoeth Thouest, Forever," then say, "activate."

When done sweep the soap up and throw next to your garbage cans in back of garbage cans not inside. (you only have to do this once).
