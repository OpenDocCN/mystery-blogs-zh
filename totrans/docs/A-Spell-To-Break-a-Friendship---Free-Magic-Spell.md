Take two lemons and cut the stem ends off.

Write one name eight times on a piece of paper and the other persons name eight times on another. Roll both up. Using your Boline knife make a hole in the top of each lemon. Insert the first paper in one lemon and the other paper in the other lemon. Bury these lemons in the earth where the sun rises and sets on them. Every night at sunset pour one cup vinegar on the lemons. Repeat the following rubric:

Coming Night please hear my plight
Bring coldness and bury friendship's light
Blind the eyes of [first name] and [second name].
Let them not be friends again
Let all ties break and end.
So Mote it Be

Those people will fight and part.
