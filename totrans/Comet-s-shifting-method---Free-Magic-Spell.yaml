- en: Step 1: Get into a comfortable position and close your eyes. Count to 50 while
    breathing in and out with every number. Start to meditate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Step 2: Once you''re meditating and are calm, visualise the parts of your animal
    form (like horns, ears, tail, claws, etc.) forming on your body. Watch them pull
    themselves out of your body and exist. You should feel tingles and itchiness where
    the parts should be.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Step 3: Feel the bones and joints of parts that have them, such as wings or
    your tail. Feel each joint and move it, you should feel as if you actually have
    a tail and it is actually moving.'

- en: 'Step 4: The big part, visualise the rest of your body changing, like being
    covered in fur or scales, and feel every scale, every piece of fur, move and grow.
    You should be able to feel the fur/scales/etc move when you move.'

- en: And there you go! open your eyes, see you haven't p-shifted, but you feel all
    the parts of your animal, and you've successfully phantom shifted.

    however it can be detrimental to your mental state and energy.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This method has allowed me to m-shift and m-flare a few times. Most of my m-flares
    are spontaneous but this has helped bring one on before, and strengthen my instincts
    after ~2 years of pushing them away.

- en: Step 2 : Count backwards from 100 down to 0, picturing the sun (your human thoughts,
    ideas, and rationalism) going down past the horizon and bringing on the night
    (your animal side, instincts, will to hunt). This step may take a while, but as
    you count down, push away human thoughts. if they come, count over them. After
    a while, the numbers should start to sound foreign as you think of your animal
    side and its instincts, and bring them out as the night begins to rise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Step 3 : Once you have reached zero and the numbers sound like pointless noises,
    let your mind take you to a new place. A forest, for example, if you're a wolf
    or a deer. In that new place, continue looking through your animal. Let your mind
    and instincts take you. Do you see prey? Chase it. Hunt it. Catch it. Run free,
    be free.
