    items for this spell:** Many times we find ourselves away from our Coven, Temple,
    Altar and home when the Moon becomes full. We think that it would be wonderful
    to do a little Ritual in honor of the Moon, but have no tools, candles, incense
    etc. The magick is within you and the power of visualization is the vehicle of
    transportation.'

    of your power hand three times, and then extend your hand to the Moon as a gesture
