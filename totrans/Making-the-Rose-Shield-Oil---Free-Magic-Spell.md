# Making the Rose Shield Oil

  Rated 5/5 Stars

One of the best ways to create your protective shield is through meditation. Saying a prayer, spell, lighting a candle and sprinkling a little potion around your home and yourself can also aid in the support of your efforts. The following is a simple recipe for a protection oil called The Rose Shield.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   2 Full cups of finely chopped rose pedals.

*   3 Whole Rose Pedals

*   8 Cups Water

*   ¼ Cup Chopped Sage

*   Equal parts of Olive and Almond oil, enough to make ¼ cup

## Casting Instructions for 'Making the Rose Shield Oil'

 It is best not to use hybrid roses as their molecular structure has been altered to produce color. Use the standard white, red and pink rose varieties instead. Or if you can, wild roses are the best. ** A coffee filter can be used in place of cheese cloth.

Creating The Potion

You want to have a small rhyme ready to chant over the ingredients as you mix them together. This is a method of charging the items as you combine them and set the intent of the potion. Your rhyme should be short, about 4 lines long and easy to remember and say. This is a protection potion, so your rhyme should address that intent.

> > **"With roses and sage I do set,**
> 
> **an air of protection that must be met.**
> 
> **With linguring fragrance of pedals so small,**
> 
> **I charge this potion with each and every call".**

Pick the sage at dusk and place it in a warm dry place inside your home. 1 long stalk of sage will make about ½ cup of chopped material.

Pick the rose pedals early in the morning, before the sun has a chance to dry them out.

In a medium sauce pan, mix the water and oil and let it simmer over a medium flame while you prepare the pedals and sage.

Using a pair of scissors, cut the rose pedals into small pieces, less than ½ inch square, until you can make 2 full cups of pedals. Chop the sage stalk into ¼ inch pieces. If the stalk has started blooming or seeding, include this portion of the sage as well. Add all the ingredients to the sauce pan and simmer for 30 minutes. Stirring occasionally.

Reduce heat, cover and simmer for another 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool until the liquid is luke warm. Drain the liquid into a sterilized bottle with a cheese ** cloth. Squeeze the contents of the cloth to drain any liquid left over in the pedals and sage.

Add the whole pedals to the liquid bottle and close with a cork or glass stopper. Let stand in a cool place for 3 days before use.

The Rose Shield Use the oil in conjunction with a protection spell. To protect your home, sprinkle this oil across the door ways and windows.

To protect your car and it's occupants before a long trip, sprinkle the tires and steering wheel.

To protect your sacred space, sprinkle around the outside of the space.

To protect yourself, rub a small amount of the oil on inside of your writs, the top of your hands, the soles of your feet and the inside of your ankles.
