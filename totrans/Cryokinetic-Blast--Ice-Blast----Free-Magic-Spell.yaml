    technique, and only those who are good at psionic may only be able to use it...
    *Continue, only if this is a last resort.* *Cryoblast* First you have to be able
    to do hydrokinesis & aerokinesis to do this technique. If you know how to do both
    hydrokinesis & aerokinesis, then continue on.

    make a ball of water. (Kind of like your making a psi ball except fill that psi
    ball with water.)

    to just drop the temp by a few degrees so yay
  prefs: []

    things?

    is different thing, beside this is not working that way, sorry this is just fantasy

    at a person and knock them back. You cannot summon wind to blast someone across
    the room. You might be able to ground your energy and feel colder. You can work
    with snow and ice in your Magik as you would water. You can cast freezer spells
    to freeze bad habits. This specific shoot ice blasts is nonsense.
