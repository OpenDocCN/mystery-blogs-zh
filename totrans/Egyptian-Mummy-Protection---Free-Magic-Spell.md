**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A jar

*   Whitish grayish sand

*   1 money bag or similar

 Put the sand in the jar then set it aside leave it there for about a week. Take the jar again. Go outside and set the sand down. Now, wave your hand over the jar and wave over lid. Then hold (with lid off) the jar up to the sun and say: "Collect your bones! Gather your limbs! Shake the Earth from your flesh! Your Master is here! Your Master commands it! So you shall stay near! I command ja!"

Now take some sand and make a circle around you without stepping outside of it. Then throw some to the North, South, East and West. Then take what’s left and throw it up some may land in your hair but that is fine. Now go down on your knees and cross your arms across your chest while you face your element E.G My element is Fire so I face the South. Then Say (Seto Way and shout NAAY!). Now you can sweep away the sand but keep some on you in the money bag
