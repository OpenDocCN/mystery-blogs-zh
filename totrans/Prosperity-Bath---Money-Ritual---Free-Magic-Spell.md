# Prosperity Bath & Money Ritual

This prosperity/money bath spell today is different - this is a nice solid traditional spell where all the components work together as they should to create a portal that will manifest the intention, in this case a specific sum of money.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Prosperity Bath & Money Ritual'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 green candle

*   3 silver coins

*   Salt

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 green candle

*   3 silver coins

*   Salt

 Take the green candle and inscribe the amount of money you need on the candle. Don't be greedy and be reasonable. Now charge your candle and three different silver coins on your altar.

While they are charging, run yourself a bath. Once run, place within the water your three silver coins and a pinch of salt.Place the green candle at the foot of your bath.Now light the green candle and turn off the other lights in your bathroom.

Lay back in the water and focus on the flame of the candle and visualise you recieving this money. Chant "The green Dragon flies over the sea - bringing wealth and prosperity to me"

NOTE: Do not wash, just soak in the water. Once the candle has burned down a quarter of the way get out the bath and dry yourself. Take the candle and your coins to your altar. Allow the candle to burn down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A note: If you don't have an altar or you don't know what "charging your coins" means, you can still do this money spell. Take a nice piece of paper, and on the underside, write, "Charge Me!". Turn it over and place your coins on that on a shelf or window sill. That will do the trick.
