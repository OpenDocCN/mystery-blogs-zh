- en: Even though they’re lots of fun, love spells are also really tricky. They’re
    hard to cast *well* and can backfire easily.
  prefs: []

- en: As much as you might picture your *ideal* outcome when you’re considering a
    love spell, there are lots of ways a love spell can go wrong that you should consider
    equally.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, your love spell might straight up not work. This can happen for
    a variety of reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might not be able to raise enough energy to successfully cast a love spell,
    or you might just be working with a bad spell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason your spell might fail is if your intention is wrong. For example,
    you might think you’re casting a love spell, but you’re projecting anger when
    you raise energy, the spell turns into a hex.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The spell might then cause your intended to have trouble in future relationships
    or to be unable to find a partner. These are only a few examples of the way the
    spell might manifest, but the point is that you haven’t really cast a love spell
    if your intention wasn’t *love.*

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember in Harry Potter, when J.K. Rowling explains that love spells can’t
    really create love, so they create obsession? She definitely took that bit of
    knowledge from traditional witchcraft.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As popular as love spells are, they just can’t create love if it doesn’t already
    exist. If someone *does* love you then you can manifest that love to grow, but
    if absolutely no love exists, then it can’t be created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you cast a strong love spell on someone who doesn’t love you, the spell will
    probably manifest in obsession. Your intended might become totally obsessed with
    you without knowing why, but even if you enter into a relationship, it won’t ever
    feel like true love.
  prefs: []

- en: If love spells backfire in this way, they can end up feeling more like [hexes
    or jinxes](https://teaandrosemary.com/curses-hexes-and-jinxes-whats-the-difference/)
    rather than true love spells.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your intended already loves you then there is a possibility for a love spell
    to work. They could start to see you in a better light and notice your positive
    qualities. Their love can then grow naturally with the assistance of the spell’s
    energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem with this is that *you* might not know if it’s real.

- en: As long as your spell is cast, you’ll always feel as though the relationship
    isn’t legit.
  prefs: []

    you won’t have this problem, think carefully before casting!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, you love spell doesn’t create love *or *obsession. Instead, you can
    create a chord that ties you to your intended.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your intended might want to move on or meet other people but is tied to you
    so they can’t. You will probably also be tied.

- en: Sometimes, this will mean that you work things out and get back together. That
    sounds great right? Not so fast. You’ll both feel like you’re together out of
    obligation, not out of desire. These are the types of relationships where both
    people absolutely hate each other but stay together anyways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For either person to move on, you need to break the chord between you and the
    object of your spell.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say your love spell works perfectly. Your lover wants to be with you and
    give the ultimate commitment. All of a sudden, however, you start noticing things
    about your partner that you didn’t see before and these aren’t not good qualities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s pretty common for a witch to cast a love spell on someone they *think*
    they want to be with, only to find out when it works that they don’t. Unfortunately,
    love spells are really hard to reverse. Sometimes, you just can’t reverse it completely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you cast a love spell, you need to be *completely* positive that your
    intended is the person for you.

    still one glaring issue. Will you ever tell your partner about the spell that
    you cast?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In so many ways, a love spell zaps the free will of the intended. You basically
    decided what your partner would feel and acted on it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if your partner did already love you, instead of letting it grow naturally,
    you coerced their love to grow. If they didn’t love you and you created obsession
    or a chord, then this is an even more volatile situation.

- en: 'Now don’t get me wrong: I’m not telling you to *never* cast a love spell. There
    are plenty of love spells that don’t force the other person to do anything. There
    are self-love spells, love spells to enhance your own attractiveness, love spells
    for rose colored glasses, etc.'

- en: Regardless of what others tell you, always follow your own intuition. When you’re
    struggling to know if you should cast a spell, try divination (Tarot, pendulum,
    etc.) to figure out if a spell is right for you, and follow your gut.
