    Walk around the circle, and touch each item (light them if they are candles) calling
    out to the spirits of that direction. Then stand in the middle and call out to
    the spirits of the universe.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Confusing as this might sound, you cast a circle and close it before the spell,
    then open the circle at the end [this person just got the terms mixed up] so you
    cast the circle whichever way works best for you [either look up one if you don't
    have a circle casting or message me, don't have enough space here] when you're
    opening the circle you go in the opposite direction/order, so you say thank you
    to any deities you called in [which isn't needed for this spell] then go to the
    last quarter [direction] you went to, thank the energy and say goodbye, and walk
    in the opposite direction giving thanks to each quarter as you go.
