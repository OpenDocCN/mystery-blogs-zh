  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Avians are winged humanoids, people who have undergone the process of growing
    wings, air sacks, hollow bones, and feathers for flight. Contrary to popular belief,
    wing growth is not shifting. They often have wings very similar, if not exactly
    like a bird's, as feathered wings are the most efficient for flight. Avians can
    have the wings of hawks, eagles, or even quail. An Avian's wing type is almost
    a spiritual connection, it is such a deep link that even looking at the wings
    can cause phantom sensations and pain. Avians seek out wing growth due to a "call
    to the sky" that is very powerful and present since early childhood. Some say
    that avians have a unique genetic makeup that allows them to grow wings, others
    say anyone can grow wings.

  prefs: []

- en: Wings require upwards of three years of visualisation, energy manipulation,
    focus, and willpower to grow. Constant visualisation and mental shifting is required.
    Internal changes happen first - your bone structure begins to change to allow
    wings to grow, your internal bone structure begins to become hollow, air sacks
    form behind the lungs and your lungs get larger (resulting also in a larger ribcage
    and chest), and you begin to lose weight as your metabolism speeds up. Second,
    your body begins to develop the muscle. Your pectoral muscles will shrink to make
    room for the second set of pectorals (as wings are modified arms), and you may
    lose muscle power as a result. You will begin to gain muscle on your back as well,
    that will link your new pectorals to your wings. Third, your stem cells start
    to produce the skin tissue, cartilage, and bone of your wings. The wings start
    as a lump of cells then begin to separate, appearing as a "nub" before they begin
    to look like wings. You will start to develop down feathers at this time as well. Once
    wings "sprout", they grow quickly. Once bone and cartilidge is formed, down feathers
    will quickly shed and become flight feathers. The very minimum size of fully grown,
    ready-to-fly wings is 18 feet, and most avians have wings that span within 20
    to 30 feet.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common method used by avians involves incorporating them into your daily life
    through constant visualisation, phantom shifting, and mental shifting. You must
    learn what your wingtype is, how it flies, what are the benefits, what kind of
    flight it is best at, etc. Then, you must start to visualise yourself with the
    wings. You can visualise the changes happening in order, or you can visualise
    with fully grown wings. Meditate every night about your wings, see them grow and
    develop. Mentally feel what it would be like to fly, to soar, to take off. Visualise
    constantly and phantom shift every time you can. Phantom wings may start to become
    permanent and pain should be commonplace. Keep pushing and take progress pictures
    at least once a month to compare. Once notable growth starts, you will see rapid
    changes.

- en: Many avians and wing growers use subliminals to help their progress. Listening
    to subliminals at a low volume during meditation is a good way to boost your progress
    as your subconscious is more likely to be receptive during meditation. Here is
    a playlist of wing subliminals and a booster. : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdmSwMYir8Qh8EskJNjXM_RUD7eNUPcui

- en: Wings cannot be hidden, they cannot be shifted away, and they are visible to
    everyone who sees you. Growing wings is a dangerous task not suitable for all
    people. Many avians have encounters with hunters and end up dead due to being
    too reckless, out there, or attempting to expose themselves. The only time wings
    may be able to be shown in public would be at a cosplay convention, but even that
    is dangerous. Do not become an avian if you are not prepared for having to give
    up your social life, school, public places, friends, and even family gatherings.
