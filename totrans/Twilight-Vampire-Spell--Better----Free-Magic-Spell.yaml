- en: Spirits of the undead, I ask you please to turn me into a Vampire. My skin will
    be like granite unbreakable. I will get one special gift which will be ________.
    I can feed on both human and animal blood, if I bite a human and leave it alive
    the human will begin turning into a vampire. The transformation will be painful
    and will take three hours. I will have super strength, Super speed, Super senses.
    My eyes will be bright red if I drink human blood and golden if I drink animal
    blood and black when I am hungry. I will sparkle in the sunlight if I want to.
    My teeth will be unbreakable and I will not have fangs, I will have normal teeth
    that are razor sharp. And this is my will So mote it be!

- en: I do not intend to ''ruin your dreams'' merely give context of reality. Should
    you choose to dress like a vampire, behave as a vampire, work blood Magic and
    call on spiritual vampires, then go forth and live your life. Unfortunately Magic
    has limitations on the physical plane, mainly if it goes against nature Magic
    cannot do it. For this reason you cannot transform into a vampire, you were born
    human, and human you shall remain.
