- en: The idea of choosing a magickal name - or craft name - has a history shrouded
    in mystery. There is no historical reason for people to choose a magickal name,
    but some have speculated that it was due to Christianity and persecution. This
    makes sense because, when captured and tortured for practicing witchcraft, you
    would be made to give up the names of your fellow witches. But what if you all
    only knew each other by your craft names, and those were names kept from everyone
    else? It would make it difficult for the church to find the other witches. That
    is a theory, anyway.

- en: There are a variety of reasons why one might choose to use a magickal name.
    Maybe they are afraid of getting caught and “outed”. Maybe they simply like the
    anonymity it provides. Maybe it means something to them. Or maybe, like [Lady
    Althaea](https://www.ladyalthaea.com/every-day-is-magickal/dedication-and-names),
    their magickal name is chosen for them by their Gods.

- en: The magickal name can become part of your identity and, when used, is like donning
    your robes for a ceremony or ritual. It becomes who you are at that moment, and
    it is a reminder to yourself and those around you that this is a time separated
    from the mundane.

- en: It was speculated that the mottos people went by in the Hermetic Order of the
    Golden Dawn had some significant meaning in their life. Names like *Sapere Aude*
    and *Perdurabo* sound mystical to those of us who do not speak Latin, but these
    names simply mean “Dare to be wise” and “I will last through”. If you are going
    to choose a magickal name for yourself, you can do so by choosing something that
    has meaning for you. If English is not your native language, choose something
    in your mother tongue for a deeper connection.

    pick something that you like. There is nothing wrong with this if it fits in with
    your practice! Just be sure you are not appropriating from other cultures and
    the name you choose does not have an alternate meaning that could be misinterpreted
    by others.

- en: If you fancy numerology, you can use that to your advantage when choosing a
    magickal name. Figure out your birth number and then choose a name that has the
    same birth number. To figure out your birth number, add the digits in your date
    of birth together until you get a single digit. Let’s use mine as an example.

    11 8 1991\. Now you add them together.

    a birth name, choose one that has the same numerological number as your birth
    number. You can do this by using the table [here](https://www.lucky-name-numerology.com/numerology-3.html)
    that has the alphabet and their corresponding values.

    for you. This is what happened with Lady Althaea, and I highly recommend you read
    her post about her experience.

    Gods. It might be a requirement of certain traditions of Wicca and witchcraft,
    but I could not tell you for certain.

    for me. At this point, I do not see the necessity of having a magickal name because
    I do not have to practice in secret, and my craft encompasses every part of my
    life anyway. My craft is who I am, and who I am at this point is Megan.
