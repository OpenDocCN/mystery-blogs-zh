Sorry, You cannot become hybrid creature or change your body into another creature.

but why is there a whole category for fantasy spells?

Because they used to be in the Trick Spells category, which wasn't obvious enough so Pet made the Fantasy Spells section alluding to the fact they're fake [fantasy: work of fiction] While some spells in this section do work [many of these beings are spiritual/astral and are worked with on a spiritual level] the vast vast majority are fake. These spells are popular because people who don't understand how actual magick works search for fake spells [how to fly, become invisible, change into a were-bunny-vampire-demon with angel wings that glows in the dark] This traffic generates ad revenue and keeps the site free. So, unless a spell promotes something harmful, they stay up.

You cannot become half-anything.
