# Kramon Released (Fallen Angel)

  Rated 5/5 Stars

Finally I have decided to release a very dark enity. His name is Kramon used to be an angel but has fallen from heaven. His main manifest is a black shadow headgehog carries a cythe. He'll only protect you if someone did you wrong.

Be sure to be in a dark quite room alone.

2.)Put the white candle below the black candle few inches apart.Put the two candles on the paper straight line horizontally then light them.(VERY IMPORTANT THIS WILL ALLOW KRAMON TO BE GOOD AND BAD WITHOUT THIS MORE CHANCES HE'LL TURN AGAINST YOU)

''Oh Kramon you have fallen from heaven down to earth
Your heart is half darkness
Bless me with your protection against ALL my enemies that
striken me dirty
revenge shall BE!''

Let the candles burn out over time,If one of them burn out suspiciously 5 minutes after the spell then he's with you. You can also tell he's with you when you see him in your dreams.

The more focus you put on Kramon the more you'll give him power to achieve your will.

''black shadow headgehog'' hahahahahahaha ...no. no demon with any self respect would manifest as a hedgehog

You forgot the cythe, so a fallen angel in the form of a shadow hedgehog reaper makes way more sense lol. Got to say, this is a new one for me, I applaud their imagination.

Obviously need to say it, but this is fake. That said, why would a fallen angel become a shadow hedgehog holding a cythe that's half evil? Once you're cast out of heaven the grim reaper recruits you? Also candle formation is what makes him both good and bad without turning on you why? He also into fung shui?

This demon is real and seen it many times in my deep sleep aka sleep paralysis. Yes it appears of this form so I go with it. Believe it or not no reason to waste time.

The demonic entity can and might be real, but it's name isn't Kramon. Remember that demons can appear in all sorts of shapes, they can take shapes that you do not even believe, my friend. During a ritual a snake turned into a dark figure outside my pentagram and I still haven't managed to find out what demon it was.

Well, there are more demons than you can think of. People only reincount the powerful, while there are a lot that people have not encounted or read in the bible. Those are top rate demons being the first demon, princes of hell and so forth. You think thats all that populates hell? Well, i will leave you to your ignorance Theurgic.

Seriously... What is this? There is no such thing as a demonic entity called 'Kramon'. There is no fallen angel called 'Kramon'. Get off your ass and go read some REAL books about magic. Magic isn't a game, dude. You can't just create an entity that doesn't even exist. Why did you even do this spell?

applaud your efforts, but careful with the swears as it could get your account gagged. this is just someone playing pretend and wanting to look cool, just kindly explain why this is fake and move on, don't get too riled up over it or you'll have a bad time.

Actually ''Theurgic'' nobody knows all the demons and angels so this could be a fallen angel (it is probably not though) To the author of this ritual I recommend studying already discovered angels and demons and not wastig time chasing and summoning imaginary demons. Also the demon can appear in any form it could be a chicken (demons usually are in forms of just a shadow because they are too powerful to be in their true form. IF and I am repeating IF he is true and you really did see him in your dreams then you need to get as many protection spells as possible because the demon might be looking for a host/vessel and unless you really need his help, then I don't recommend doing it (I am speaking from experience). ''Fujin'' please stop posting fake rituals please it is a real time waster

What if it is an undiscovered entity that few people know about? Did that ever hit yalls minds? We dont know every demon or angel or hybrid angel, demon, or just a hybrid. We dont know everything. Its not going to be in a book because it probably only appears to worthy people worth its time.

I agree magik is not a game if used the right way you may even suprise your self

Does it have to be shaded

I would say yes. It is a shadow entity, so i would try to shade as best as you can. I hope it works for you Thedragon202.

My first spell was forest spirits and it worked . also I have a question?
