- en: There is nothing more important than loving ourselves. It can open up new horizons
    and make life enjoyable. Many people don’t realize this is a choice and a decision
    everyone should be making. You need to love yourself. Let’s take a look at how
    you start.

- en: Love is the most important part of life, and it begins with you. If you don’t
    love yourself, others are not going to love you. It is all about developing self-respect
    over time. Those who don’t respect you are going to push away over time, and that’s
    good.

- en: Self-love is one of those things you need when it comes to magick. If you do
    not love yourself, how are you going to move forward with rituals? It is all about
    practice. In essence, you are opening up the mind and learning how to relax and
    respect like never before.

    perform this and can maximize their value. You don’t need long sessions; it can
    be done on the bus for example.

- en: So, let’s say you want to meditate. How do you go about it? You want to find
    a beautiful, quiet place that will let you relax. The thoughts in your head should
    flow away as you focus on taking deeper breaths. Just zone in on the breathing.
    It is all about letting go a bit and making sure your attention is in sync with
    your body instead of what’s in your mind.

- en: When your attention is in your heart chakra (middle of the chest), this is when
    you’ll see results. You want to make sure your attention is near the eyes as that’s
    a significant component of meditation, but you also want to lower this attention
    during the process towards the heart. When you do this, you are going to start
    to come in line with various forms of love (i.e. self-love, universal love, and
    romantic love).
  prefs: []

- en: What you’re looking to do is breathe into the heart chakra. What are you going
    to feel? You will notice a ball of light start to develop near the chest. This
    is going to give you new energy, and it is going to help the heart chakra grow
    over time. You want it to start become a radiant example of warmth. This is how
    you’re going to start to increase your loving energy for everything around you
    including people. You will want to think about things that are joyous and will
    give you energy. In fact, an individual may think about something as powerful
    as a tornado to do so. You will want this to help you strength your heart chakra.
    Just let it soak you up.
