 ## Casting Instructions for 'The Conjuration of Archangel Gabriel'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Day of Moon or Monday

*   Hour of Moon (Optional)

*   Anise, orange, rose, sage scents

*   Azurite, Citrine, Rutilated Quartz, or Sapphire

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Day of Moon or Monday

*   Hour of Moon (Optional)

*   Anise, orange, rose, sage scents

*   Azurite, Citrine, Rutilated Quartz, or Sapphire

If you are unsure when the Day of Moon is, a Monday will work just as well. Though, it is optional. The conjuration will just have a higher success rate on these days.

Start by applying the anise, orange, rose, or sage scents to yourself or the room you are working in (Incense or oils, though the real herbs anise, rose, or sage will do)

Sit in a chair or on the ground comfortably with your eyes closed. Your offering (Azurite, Citrine, Rutilated Quartz, Sapphire, ect) should be within your palms. How you interact with Gabriel now, is up to your personal self. If you are clairvoyant, you will see him within your mind's eye. If clairaudient, you will hear his commanding voice. Clairsentient, you will feel his masculine energies.
