- en: This isn't real, it's just a bunch of gibberish. You can call on Dragons to
    help with a cleansing, but this spell is fake.

- en: This incantation does call on dragons....just isn't english its latin and certainly
    not gibberish... And if I did something wrong...please just tell me what that
    is instead of critisizing me like I am some piece of dirt

- en: You didn't do anything wrong, I work with Dragons and decided to go through
    the spell sections [because I decided to pick two days a week to focus on SoM
    and editing/commenting on the site] Sorry I don't speak Latin, but the amount
    of times people have made up gibberish and called it a spiritual language, I didn't
    bother googling it to see if it was Latin because I had gone through so many fake
    Dragon spells that day, I was tired. I still stand by it being fake because as
    is, you say something three times and a Dragon named Convexity [which I've never
    heard of. If this is your Guide Dragon it would only work for you because the
    Dragon wouldn't assist anyone else.] cleanses you but if you aren't calm it will
    backfire [another sign of a fake spell, claiming if you make one mistake you're
    doomed] So in conclusion I've got nothing wrong with you [don't even know you]
    I just read over a spell, saw the flags of it being fake, and stated so because
    I don't want people wasting their time.

    thanks for your advice

- en: I mean no offense by this but many of your spells have Latin and it seems as
    if you don't speak it or at least are not fluent in it. There tend to be grammatical
    errors and words that don't make sense in the context of the sentence, and it
    gives the impression you ran it through Google Translate. There's nothing inherently
    wrong with using Latin in spells, but if you don't really know the language it
    will bring more harm than good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no dragon named Eonix. If you do not speak Latin, do not use Latin.
    Calling on dragons for purification could work, but I doubt this spell works.
