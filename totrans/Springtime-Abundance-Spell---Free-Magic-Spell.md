cut a few stems of just blooming buds from a cherry tree. Place them in a vase of water upon your altar.

Take up the candles in your hand and speak the following while charging them with green abundant energy:

''Lady of spring, to you I pray,
Abundance I need in my life, as you see.
Abundance I desire to fulfill my life's missions
Abundance I need to make those about me happy.
Bring to me, sweet maiden of springtime fair,
The joys of growth to my wallet as springtime waxes.''

Now place the candles on either side of the vase and light them.

In front of the vase set a dish of soil. Place your hands in the soil-feel the soil, crumble it in your fingers, and inhale its earthy scent. When you feel connected to this Earth energy speak these words:

''Now the green grow season so begins,
And all nature begins to stir again.
I ask the lady of the spring season,
bless me with abundance, wealth, and prosperity.
See it comes to me and fulfill my needs. ''

Leave the stems upon your altar for a few days.
