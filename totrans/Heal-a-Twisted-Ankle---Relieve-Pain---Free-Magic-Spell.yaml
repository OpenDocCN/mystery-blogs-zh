    myself since. It has worked every time it's done in my presence. If there is swelling
    or broken bones this spell is not for you, seek medical attention.

    Dip your fingers in the bowl of water and slowly let the water drip down the leg
    starting halfway below the knee. VERY lightly, run your fingers down the lower
    leg to the ankle with the water, re-dipping your fingers as need, while telling
    the afflicted to close their eyes and imagine the pain they feel being pulled
    into the water droplets running down their leg and running out of them. Imagine
    with them. Focus on the image of their pain receding with the water. Remember
    to speak in calming hushed tones about how their pain is flowing with the water
    out and off of their leg/ankle. Do this for a few minutes or as long as you feel
    necessary. Once the afflicted is visibly calmed and not in pain anymore you may
    stop. Gently pat the water off the leg with a towel when you've finished.
