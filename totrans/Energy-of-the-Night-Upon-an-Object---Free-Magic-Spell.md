 **Note:** The object you are enchanting must be something that won't be damaged by water. It must also be cleansed prior to this spell. Also, you can call out to whichever god or goddess you prefer, or use your own chant, if you wish. This spell should be done during the full moon. Take the water and fill the bowl with it. Add the black ink with the pipette or eyedropper until the water is completely black. Take the object, bowl, and bag outside with you, or to a window there you can see the moon. Place the bowl somewhere the moon can reflect on the surface of the dark water, and say the following:

> > **"Black inky sky which bears the pregnant moon, I call out to you, as your humble servant. I ask your blessing upon this water which reflects your greatness, so all it touches may be filled with your power.**
> 
> **Place the object in the bowl so it is completely covered by the water, and continue the chant.**
> 
> > **Let this (object name) be blessed with the powers of the night, so that I may always carry your strength with me. So mote it be."**

> Remove the object, dry it with the paper towels, and place it in the bag. Remove it from the bag when needed for spells, rituals, etc. Recharge it monthly during each full moon.
