# Pet Protection(Spells8) with my own flair to it - Witchy Wisdom - The Spells8 Forum

One of our cat’s, Savage, hadn’t come home for 2 nights and a day so I was starting to get a little worried. He loves his wet food and will come in from outside around the time we give the wet food to the cats so I took notice when he hadn’t come home.

**Well it was a success!!!**

I performed this ritual the night before last around 2am.
Aside from the shake of the earthquake, I was feeling worried, but optimistic and hopeful, felt confident in my magic and the results I would yield, which was Savage coming home safely!

He is an Orange Tabby Maine Coon so I used Orange and White candles.
The **Crystal beings** who aided in this ritual were *Tiger’s eye, Rose Quartz, Amethyst, Bloodstone, Smokey Quartz, Selenite, Blue Tiger’s Eye, Black Tourmaline, Quartz, Sodalite, Blue Lace Agate, and Leopard Skin Jasper*.
**Herbs:** *Rosemary for cleansing space and protection, Chamomile for love and comfort, Myrrh(resin) for spiritual guidance and confidence, White Sage for clearing energies, and Palo Santo(stick) for creating sacred space and cleansing items being used and myself*.
**Tools:** *Cauldron, Strength Tarot card, bowl for herbs, glass of water, charcoal tablet, tongs, Protection Anointing Oil, paper to write pet’s name or a photo, matches or lighter, (optional)pictures of other pet’s to help/assist in sending out love and protection, statues or figurines of deities or guides*.

I started off with lighting the candles and putting the anointing oil on my third eye, each of my wrists, and on my heart. I took the Palo Santo and asked the plant spirit to bless my tools and myself with guidance, love and light.

Going into a meditation, I thought of why I was doing this spell and what outcome I was hoping to achieve. I held space for this until I felt ready to proceed. Now the meditation can be done however you like, I chose to do this as I was setting up all of my items and tools.

I lit up one of the charcoal tablets and placed it in my mini cauldron, sprinkled my herb mix on it and enjoyed the smoky smells.

My finishing touches for set up were to add the photo’s in frame of Kronik and Kosher, another of Tigger, and then my cat figurine to represent Mocha(RIP my cat babies!).

Once I was set up, I made sure my glass of water and candles were evenly spaced out from each other. This space was used to put my piece of paper with Savage’s name on it.

I took my Strength Tarot card from the deck Mystical Cats Tarot and chanted:

**"Protect my pet, my beloved companion.** **And I promise to take care of my animal as you take care of yours.** **If my friend is lost, let them come back to me.** **Bring me joy and strength.** **So mote it be."**

And for an extra oomph:

**"Great adventurer, wild warrior, noble cat,** **Be protected on your journey within the home and in the wild.** **Wherever you roam, you will always return safe, healthy, and whole."**

I sprinkled drops of water from the glass onto the paper with my pet’s name while letting the candles burn for a few minutes. I snuffed it out and cut the wick, putting the wick with the piece of paper. I took the glass of water and tossed the liquid out. I thanked the Strength card and put it back in the deck.

I didn’t bury the paper and wick right away as I was super tired being that it was almost 3am at that point, WITCHING HOUR! Muhahaha.

When I woke up later on, I buried the contents around 9:45ish. My daughter and I were talking about how we wished Savage was home and then all of a sudden she yells, “Savage boy!” It was 10:30 or around that time.

Talk about quick response time universe!!! Thank you!

This isn’t as put together as most of my spell posts as my child is distracting me while cleaning but lol I’ve been typing this since yesterday so I wanted to publish it.
