*   Hummingbird nectar or plant nectar w/ honey

Set up a space for your fairy friends! Preferably outside or by an open window near nature!
Leave out snacks for your guests! Don't be rude, leave out treats like baked goods, sweet things, plant nectar, hummingbird feed, honey, etc..
Give them a concerto! Leave out bells and chimes, as these are the fairies favorite instruments! They love the sounds they make, and I myself recommend them for any home!
Also, they won't investigate your home unless they have a reason! Tempt them with shiny stones and metallic things! They love to investigate human things so humans be advised!!
Now, time for the meditation ritual...

Sit down by your fairy spot and think about all the lovely things in your life! All that you love and care about! And whenever you start thinking about bad things, like finances and family disputes... think about love and friendship and sweet things like the fae! And whenever you lose focus, don't give up hope! Know that there must be a light somewhere that's casting all the shadows on our existence!
Finally, calm down. Breathe. Question your existence. Wonder how something so great could be formed in this time and this place, and feel your aura glowing around you. Your light should be enough to guide the fae to your home!

Some rather helpful suggestions here. A couple things, if you bake a fairy cake as an offering, offer the perfect cake, even if you use a toothpick to check if it is done that mark can offend some fairys and they will give you misfortune. Fairys are not sweet joyous beings of pure love and light as today's culture claim, many can be spiteful, tricksters, ugly, and cruel. Be respectful and polite, but be cautious so as not to upset the fairy. They are far more like Tinkerbell in the original tale, helpful and loving to Peter, but murderous and vengeful to Wendy, over today's depiction of the character; a kind friend to all.

Do you have any recipes for fairy cakes? Im having trouble finding one.

There are traditional ones, but you can use a basic cake recipe and add honey and lavender. You could also look for a lavender oat cake/cookie. Research herbal cakes and floral cakes. By floral, I mean rose, lavender, lilac, so forth. They also enjoy saffron, so saffron cakes too. When you bake the cakes, and I am referring to cupcake size, offer the best ones. It can be insulting to offer a burnt one, one you checked with a toothpick, or has other imperfections. You should also research the fairy in question as some prefer sweets while others like savory. Some fairy's like whisky, others wine. Some even consume meat, so research is key.
