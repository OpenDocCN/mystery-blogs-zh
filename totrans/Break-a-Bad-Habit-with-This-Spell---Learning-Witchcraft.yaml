    a new way to describe yourself. This should be a positive statement. Write the

    write your statement, say it aloud to release it into the atmosphere.  This will
    help make the spell stronger.

- en: After the twenty-one days have passed, your habit should be broken. If you find
    that the habit is not broken, think back and see if you missed writing and saying
    your statement one day. Go back and re-perform the spell, ensuring that you follow
    the steps above exactly. If you did not miss any days, try writing a different
    variation of your statement and repeat it every day for another twenty-one days.
