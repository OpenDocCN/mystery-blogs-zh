    so I’m not formally endorsing or recommending any. You can learn all you need
    from the books I’ve recommended and from this site. All of us have gaps in our
    knowledge, though.

    They can be right for you if you’re looking for guided study and a community of
    like-minded people. But they also are teaching things that are readily available
    for free if you’re willing to do the work of finding sites like this one.
