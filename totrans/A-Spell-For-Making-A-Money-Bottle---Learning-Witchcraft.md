# A Spell For Making A Money Bottle - Learning Witchcraft

> 来源：[https://learningwitchcraft.com/a-spell-for-making-a-money-bottle/#0001-01-01](https://learningwitchcraft.com/a-spell-for-making-a-money-bottle/#0001-01-01)

The roots of this spell are in voodoo and it called for Spanish silver or gold coins originally. It has been adapted to use in the 21st century, but still retains the power for drawing money to its spell weaver. The ingredients are for five of different things, with each having its own significance. The sign of the spell is Gemini, so if the spell is cast whenever this sign rules, it will be even more powerful. The spell is associated with communication, youth, quick thinking, change, risk-taking and freedom.

**You will need the following:**

One thin, tall glass bottle
Five grains of rice
Five allspice
Five pecan nuts
Five sesame seeds
Five teaspoons of dried flour
Five cinnamon sticks
Five kernels of dried corn
Five cloves
Five quarters
Five dimes
Five nickels
Five pennies

Place all of your ingredients inside the bottle. (Since the number 5 is associated with turquoise, the spell will be even more powerful if you can use a bottle that color.) Make sure that the top of the bottle is secure before you shake the bottle well for five minutes, while saying these words:

*Copper gleams. Silver shines.*
*I am asking you please for this wealth to be mine.*
*And let this be done, and let it harm no one.*

Place your money bottle onto the table that you leave your wallet along with the loose change that you take from your pockets. Or if you don’t want anyone to know about your magic, you can bury your money bottle close to your house.
