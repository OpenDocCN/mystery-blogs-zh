    and the beginning of winter. It’s traditionally celebrated from the evening of
    October 31st to the evening of November 1st. The festival is considered a time
    when the veil between the physical world and the spiritual realm is thin, making
    it easier to communicate with the deceased and tap into mystical energies.

    celebrations. However, for those who practice Celtic or neo-pagan traditions,

    the harvest season and the beginning of winter. It is celebrated on the night
    of October 31st, and it is believed that on this night, the boundary between the
    living and the dead becomes blurred.
  prefs: []

    evil spirits. They would also prepare special foods to honor their ancestors and
    the gods. These foods were often made with ingredients that were abundant during
    the harvest season, such as apples, pumpkins, and grains.

    were traditionally made with spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger, and
    were given to children who went door-to-door asking for food in exchange for prayers
    for the dead. This practice eventually evolved into the modern-day tradition of
    trick-or-treating.

    the cake will have good luck in the coming year.
