    it will definitely help in untimely deaths like if you are cursed or something.

- en: Agreed, and just to cry out loud...''nothing'' will ever be ACTUALLY immortal,
    nature and magic...they have a balance, life and death, destruction and creation,
    positive and negative...if one would be immortal, that would mean that life and
    death would become unbalanced, even IF it would be possible to be or become immortal...you
    would doom yourself and everyone around you, as most likely the primordial forces
    of life and death would both try to crush the anomaly to restore the balance.
