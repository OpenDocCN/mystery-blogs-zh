# Banish Cigarette Smoking From Your Life

This spell is intended to help you to never need, crave, desire, or even smoke another cigarette.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Cigarettes

*   Sage

*   Cloves

*   Mortar and Pestles (Crushing ingredients and holding them, Cup and something to crush ingredients)

*   Paper

*   Incense

*   WILLPOWER

## Casting Instructions for 'Banish Cigarette Smoking From Your Life'

Cast a circle.
Put Sage and cloves as a base part in your cup which is in the center of the circle. Mix them around evenly. The sage is for purity and the cloves demonstrate your intent. As you mix these take as many incense sticks as you feel like and crush them into the mix. The Powder you are making should be dark, black even. Keep mixing it. Now, take as many cigarettes as you desire (the more you do, the more powerful the spell works) and crush the tobacco and put it into the mix. Focus your intention as you keep mixing it, and dispose of the butts, do not litter them nor put them in the cup.

The mixture is complete, and take the cigarette paper and write down on these why you want to stop in the wiccan alphabet. This takes more time and clarity, and the stronger effort you put into this spell the more powerful it gets. Do this on all papers.

When you feel the mixture is ready, BURN THE ENTIRE MIXTURE, either near a window or most preferred, OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE. Watch as all of the ingredients burn together, the incense covers most of the tobacco smell depending, and the sage and cloves take away from the tobacco burning.

When the entire thing is done burning, it should be cake-like and black. MIX IT AGAIN. Stare into it as these are what your lungs look like with every drag you take. Keep mixing. Store the powder somewhere where it will not be tampered with. It is best to keep this mixture for at least a week or so, looking at it whenever you crave a cigarette, if you even crave them at all.

Saturn has the overall rule on banishing spells, so doing this on a Saturday helps tremendously. At least a week later, take these ashes and bring them near water and destroy the mixture, however you feel necessary. Bury it, put it near a ocean shore, etc. The craving should go away once you take a smell of the essence you created when you first make it. If you continue to smoke, that is your call. If you feel the desire less and less, your intention was strong, and the amount you put into the spell pays off.

Another things you can do is take cigarettes, do not break or crush them, and lay them in public. A graffiti pentacle works just fine, and but the full cigarettes in the circle and leave. People will walk by and pick up the cigarettes, and once they are all made use of, you desires will shorten, less and less.

I did this and at first I kept smoking, but the desire shortened. As of now, I have said no to every cigarette offered to me and have not had cigarettes in a decent amount of time. How you do this spell and its effectiveness is entirely up to you.

I hope this helps.
