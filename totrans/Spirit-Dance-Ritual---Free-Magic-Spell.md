 **Optional:** You may take your clothes off and be in the nude. 

**Start by turning on the music you prefer for the ritual. **

**First, light your incense, then state the following:**

I set this before you at your feet O mighty God. May its pleasant scent remind you of my praise and worship of thee. Let it raise up my prayers to your throne in heaven and may it be a pedestal for your feet to sit on. Let me worry not of what lurks in the shadows at night or fleeting arrows at dawn. Hear my prayers and be with me always.

**Facing west, start off with your ritual knife and make the following gestures, then say the prayer afterwards. Light the four candles in your space in a clockwise pattern. Place them at the four cardinal points in your area. Face in each direction as you light their candle and welcome the spirits into your space with your wand. **

**Kneel, point knife forward.**

In the name of the Lord All Mighty, all devils and snares set before me tremble at the foot of the cross and shake in pain from the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Savior! Go forth away from this place and take home in the depths of Hell where thou art belong.

**Kiss ritual knife.**

**Stand up, trace the symbol of the pentagram in the air with your wand.**

I conjure thee O mighty sea spirits of the west! Come forth in the name of the nailing of the right foot of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I wish to delve deep into the mysteries of the sea. Come dance with me as we bring joy and wonder between the realm of flesh and spirit, land and sea.

I bid thee welcome…

**Kneel, face west again but now blow your horn.**

Flee in the name of the Lord with thine tails between thine own legs O wicked devils. Tremble at the sight of the blood of Jesus, Our Lord, and bare witness to the truth with burning eyes. Go forth away from this place and take home in the depths Hell where thou art belong.

**Light Stella Maris candle.**

**Stand up, trace the symbol of the pentagram in the air with your wand.**

O Lady Star of the Sea, Mother of mankind, I call upon thee in the name of the pierced heart of our Savior, your Son, Jesus Christ. Be with me at this moment and make this space a place between worlds. May the spirits of the sea be at my side as I surrender my body to its power and open my heart to your son, Jesus. I seek to be one with the Sea and the will of God, be with me now as I perform this rite.

I bid thee welcome…

**Ring bell.**

**Optional: State your intention.**

**Pick up your instrument if you have one and start dancing within this space. Once you have finished dancing and connecting with the energies thank the Virgin Mary and the spirits in the reverse order and a counterclockwise fashion. Do not dismiss them. They will leave on their own. This is a ritual about connection, and nothing more. You do not need to make offerings, but you can if you want. The ritual dance and the raising of energies is enough of an offering for the spirits. They crave connection just as much as we do. Allow these moments to do just that. When you are done, blow out all of the candles and just go about your day.**
