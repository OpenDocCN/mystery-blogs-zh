- en: Run hot water, not too hot to burn but hot enough for light steam to rise. While
    the tub is being filled light your candle and the cinnamon. When I did this I
    put some some ground cinnamon in a mortar, sprinkled some lavender oil (so it
    would burn) and it burned like incense. I'm not sure how a cinnamon stick burns
    (though I head the kind you buy at the grocery smells like plastic when you burn
    it but I've never tried) but you can always grind it or just burn cinnamon incense.Preferably
    burn candle and cinnamon inside shower but if you don't have enough ledge around
    your bathtub, just burn it near the bath. Once bath is filled put in flowers.
    You can either put them in a sachet or just floating in the water. You you're
    using lavender oil, dip the violets in the oil (or sprinkle it) before putting
    it into the bath. Once you're in the bath and you've relaxed, meditated, connected,
    or whatever it is that you personally do in a bath, use the rosemary oil on your
    skin. Say chants if you'd like. Remember to stay mindful of whatever purpose your
    doing the bath for (attract love, preparing or a sexy night, increase feeling
    of beauty, etc).

    The bath should be time to visualize your desires, focus energy, and connect to
    Aphrodite or other love deities you work with.
