- en: Before the eclipse starts, arrange yourself an outdoor sacred space. Purify
    the area with either salt or by casting a circle, then arrange your chosen items
    within your area.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the eclipse starts, visualize the items soaking up the energy of the sun.
    Imagine the energy of Fire being put into them from the sun. The energy of Earth
    coming into them from under the ground. The energy of Air from the wind and your
    own visualization, and the energy of Water from the moon as it overlaps the sun.
    Do not be afraid to pour some of your own personal energy into the items as well.
    You may also seek to call on your spirits or deities to assist you and bless the
    items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the eclipse ends, carefully gather your items. Make sure any outdoor space
    is how you left it. Your items should now have been charged significantly. If
    you used your personal energy, give yourself plenty of time to recuperate before
    thinking about doing other craft work.
