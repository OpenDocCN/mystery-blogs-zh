**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A small glass jar with a lid

*   7 rough stones of similar size

*   1 Candle (any colour but white)

After the sun has set, light the candle and place it on a flat surface, such as a tabletop. One by one, place the stones in a circle around the base of the candle. Place the jar on the table, between you and the candle.

With your left hand, take a stone and place it in the jar. Next, with your right hand hold the candle above the jar and speak aloud the following words:

> Candle's flame burning bright, By your flame on this night, Trap all evil, seal it well, In each stone, make it remain, Never to be loosed again.

Still using your right hand, drip at least three drops of wax from the burning candle into the bottom of the jar, more is fine, but no less. Return the candle to its original position on the table. Allow the wax to cool and harden, this should only take a minute or two.

Repeat the above steps, including speaking the words aloud, until all seven stones are in the jar.

When all seven stones are in the jar, place the lid on the jar and extinguish the candle. Place the jar in a dark and secret place and leave it undisturbed. Never open the jar and never remove the stones. You can repeat the spell as needed to capture negative energies, but new materials should be used each time.
