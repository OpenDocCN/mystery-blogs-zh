- en: I've seen a lot of techniques for energy manipulation, but the one I'm using
    is one that I've created and have been using since I've started in the craft(5
    years ago, as of 2022). Here's mine, hope it helps out!

- en: Okay, so, for those that are new, let me explain what this form of manipulation
    is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Energy manipulation, or aura/chi(or a similar name), is the mental process of
    energy that we already have in our bodies, waiting for us to discover it. It requires
    mental concentration to find and use those energies. Many on the website have
    been using a specific method for years, and for some who do this, just can't feel any
    results. My method is more... unique, perse, and it's helped out people with visualization
    issues, or mental/focus issues, such as ADHD.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's my method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sit/lay/stand in the place you've chosen. Turn on your calming music, if you
    have it. Open your hands, palms facing up.

- en: When you feel that you've got enough energy(don't worry, you'll know when),
    visualize them doing what you desire. Make it a psi ball, absorb it back into
    your body, whatever you want.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are not going to do anything, either release those specks into the ground,
    dissipate them, or absorb them into your body.

    add to the page.
