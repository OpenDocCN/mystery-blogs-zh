This course is a result of many years of experience with teaching Witchcraft and seeing the hurdles students are facing at the beginning of their journey. My aim was to create a course that is not based on a specific witchcraft tradition, but instead gives students a **solid foundation** in the basic principles that many witchcraft traditions have in common. The course was designed to give students a head start on their own unique journey to **discover their own magick**.

The basic principles of Witchcraft, or Magick, include a thorough understanding of how energies manifest in the physical world, the ability to **analyze the results of your own spells**, the ability to charge an object with clean intention energy, and **understanding the role of correspondences** and how they can influence the final result and practical **knowledge of magical tools**.
