    relationship. Especially in the beginning, you feel like you have a lot in common
    without trying.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus sextile Venus synastry aspect also means that you can learn how to
    give and receive affection in ways that the other person enjoys. Because this
    aspect is a sextile, you may not *totally* understand how to give affection so
    that your partner recognizes what you’re doing.
  prefs: []

    right away. This is the classic “opposites attract” relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can develop a natural bond quite easily. There is enough friction with the
    Venus opposition Venus synastry aspect to keep the relationship going, but you
    may come to find that you don’t have a lot in common, at least when it comes to
    the areas that Venus rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you may enjoy doing different things/hobbies, and you’ll have to
    learn how to balance your time together so that you can both get your needs filled.

    cause a problem.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    polarity that can make you feel like you’re two halves of a whole. Sometimes,
    Venus opposition Venus in synastry can even bring out the best qualities in each
    of you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have a strong sexual attraction with this aspect, because oppositions create
    friction, but you will need to figure out how to give and receive love. You see
    affection in completely different/opposite ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, someone with Venus in Pisces may give affection by showering their
    partner with romantic gestures, while someone with Venus in Virgo shows affection
    by doing those small, daily tasks that they know will make their partner’s life
    easier.
  prefs: []

    love differently.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    two of you.

    while the other is an extrovert. Your hobbies/interests, ways of socializing,
    clothing, decor, sense of taste, etc. are all at odds with each other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may struggle to understand why the other person would see beauty in the
    things that they like. Unlike the opposition, the square doesn’t balance; the
    wants and needs of the other just feel off or *wrong* to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    things in common, even if you’re simply having a casual conversation. You may
    feel as though you’re living in two different worlds.

    that you communicate and learn to adapt so that you each feel more comfortable.
