    large one and cut it out.

- en: Take your other piece of paper that is NOT your pentacle and draw a circle on
    it. Say, ''this circle represents my face.'' Draw various shapes such as circles,
    squares, straight or squiggly lines. Each time you draw a new shape say out loud
    what it represents.

    side then STOP and with the needle still in the paper (it's sticking out on both
    sides so you can set the paper down at a kind of angle), set it down in the center
    of your pentacle and sprinkle nutmeg all aorund the perimeter of the pentacle.

    You could try this, but you should also get into a regular skin care routine,
    perhaps a new diet, drink more water. Things to improve your skin.
