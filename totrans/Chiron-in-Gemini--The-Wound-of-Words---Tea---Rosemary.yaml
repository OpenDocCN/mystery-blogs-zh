    to really affect an individual’s schooling, career, and social self-esteem. The
    need to discover and heal the wound can be extremely strong because of how impactful

    to properly communicate. This can manifest in a variety of ways, but always feels
    the same inside.

    due to communication and intelligence.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be due to moving to a foreign country without speaking the language,
    a speech impediment, social anxiety, a lisp, a learning disability, not having
    education as a child, or the individual being told that he/she simply wasn’t intelligent.
    Sometimes, the person with Chiron in Gemini just can’t communicate the ideas in
    their head to others in a way that makes sense or sounds the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Chiron in Gemini individual might also communicate in a way that’s not acceptable
    for the time period. For instance, they may think in emotions and pictures but
    be surrounded by those who think scientifically, or communicate through music
    instead of words.

    stupid, and this can show in a variety of ways.
  prefs: []

    education, intelligence, and better communication skills are far above them and
    pedestalize those individuals. They will think that they don’t fit in due to trouble
    with words, but will always try to live up to how they see these people.

- en: I find that Chiron in Gemini, more so than other Chironic wounds, can easily
    lead to depression, mental illness, or substance abuse. This is by no means an
    absolute (I would say I’ve found this to be true 65% of the time) and will depend
    on the house and aspect. If Chiron is placed for this to happen, I think it’s
    more common in Gemini because of the erratic, dual nature of the sign.

- en: This wound is a bit more general because it can develop from a variety of outlets.
    The Chiron in Gemini person may have been actually told that they were stupid
    or unintelligent by parents, teachers, friends, or society as a child. Alternatively,
    the person was born with some sort of disability that made them feel unintelligent
    (a learning disability, social anxiety, a lisp, etc.) or they were thrown into
    a situation that caused them to believe this about themselves as they grew (e.g.
    moving to a foreign country as a child).

    kind of intelligence that is uniquely special. Society might not regard your intelligence
    or communication skills as important, but in the universe, your skills are needed;
    you have them for a reason.

    learn how to speak your truth using your intuition. You might have mediumistic
    gifts or be psychically sensitive, or have some other method of communicating
    with alternatives forms of life like animals, plants, spirits, extraterrestrial
    beings, etc.

    such as art, music, or emotions. What you’ll want to do is find and acknowledge
    your unique gift and **use it.** You were given it for a reason! What type of
    advanced, different form of communication do you possess? Your job is to find
    and use it.

    speech. Some of the most famous rappers in our time have Chiron in Gemini! It
    is only when someone accesses these special abilities (which must be done using
    intuition) that they will be able to achieve such goals.

    to write his own songs or be successful with his own songs and Megan Fox is known
    for her looks, not her superior acting skills.
