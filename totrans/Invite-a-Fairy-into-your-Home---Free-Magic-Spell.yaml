    be in a tidy and clean room, with low lighting.

    He or she might not take it with them physically, but they will appreciate it
    for sure.

    before saying ''I welcome you to be my guest, o little fairy''.

- en: 4\. Leave the room for a few hours. Fairies are shy, and they might need some
    time before they are confident enough to interact with you. Don't get disappointed
    if they don't want to interact at all, they like to have privacy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5\. When you come back to the room, look for signs that they have been there.
    Maybe something moved while you where gone, or something might be missing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep doing this for as long as you like. After some time you will have gained
    the faeries' trust, and they might want to interact with you, or help you in your
    magical workings. Good luck!

- en: I would work with fairys outside before welcoming them inside. It is like welcoming
    a fox into your home, sure, you may leave food for it, but once inside it runs
    around knocking things over because it is confused. I would leave a space outside
    where you will let the grass grow naturally and you will not enter for them, and
    if they wish to enter your home on occasion, say when you cleanse your home or
    cast a circle, say they are welcome. Fairys like their own space, so I can see
    this backfiring and that room you welcomed them in they now see as their own and
    you can never enter, less you get cursed by a spiteful fairy.
