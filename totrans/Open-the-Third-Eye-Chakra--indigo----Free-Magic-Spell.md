Keep calm and quite. Then sit cross-legged.

Put your hands in front of the lower part of the breast. The middle fingers should be straight and touch the tops, and pointing away from you. The other fingers are bent and touch at the two upper phalanges.
The thumbs point towards you and meet at the tops.

Concentrate on the third eye chakra and what it stands for, a little above the center of the two eyebrows.

Silently but clearly chant the sound ''OM'' or ''AUM''.

All this time, relaxation of the body should come a bit naturally and continue to think about the chakra, it's meaning and how it does or should affect your life.

Keep doing this until the same ''clean'' feeling seems to come back or intensity.

This is one way to open your chakra. It requires an edit. What to visualize for instance, what does ''clean'' really mean for another. Also, please begin with the root and work your way up. Going in any order can disrupt the balance and flow of the energy.
