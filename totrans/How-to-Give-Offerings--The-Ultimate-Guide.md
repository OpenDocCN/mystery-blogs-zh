*Witchcraft and magick are ancient practices that have been around for centuries, and they both involve the use of offerings. Giving offerings is an important part of many rituals, and it is a way to show respect and appreciation for the divine forces that are being called upon. Offerings can be anything from food to incense, money, or even plants and flowers. In this guide, we will explore the different types of offerings and how to give them in a meaningful way.*

#### This blog is intended to help keeping it simple.

First of all, and chiefly, what is being **exchanged is energy**. Meaning that by presenting spirits with offerings, you are simply supplying them with energy in condensed forms. While, for example, white light is more etheric and subtle, but still powerful and effective if you put enough energy into it.

### And, in turn, and as a result of you blessing them with this energy, they will bestow it back unto you. Therefore, you learn the karmic result of your energy work by working with spirits.

## 1.Food

The first type of offering to consider is **food.** This is the most common form of offering, and it can be anything from fresh fruits and vegetables to cooked meals. When giving food as an offering, it is important to choose something that is of good quality and that is suitable for the deity or energy that is being honored. **For example, if you are honoring a fertility goddess, you might choose a dish that is associated with fertility, such as eggs or honey.**

Spirits also like **sweets** as they say, and chocolate is a very good offering to give, along with wine or **grape juice** if you don't drink.

> **Rice** if often use as an offering to the dead or for an ancestral altars, but makes good neutral offering to most spirits, same like **water, just avoid salt in any offerings as salt harms spirits.**

Hard liquors like **rum** or **whiskey** are more of a specialty offerings for specific spirits, who are known to enjoy them, but they are not commonly used as a generic offering.

## 2.Incense

The second type of offering is incense. Incense is a powerful tool for invoking certain energies and calling upon the spirits. When giving incense as an offering, it is important to choose something that is appropriate for the deity or energy that is being honored. **For example, if you are honoring a goddess of love, you might choose a blend of rose, jasmine, and sandalwood.**

Beyond this, and from my experience, not all spirits like **incense**. So, if you are intuitive, feel it out. But it may not be necessary to use it or offer it any. If you feel that incense is a good idea, then **Sandalwood** or **Nag Champa** make a good neutral offering incense, that fits most spirits and rituals.

## 3.Money

The third type of offering is money. Money is a powerful

symbol of abundance, and it can be used as an offering in many rituals. When giving money as an offering, you should choose something that is of good quality and that is suitable for the deity or energy that is being honored. For example, if you are honoring a goddess of wealth, you might choose a coin that is made of gold or silver.

## 4\. Flowers

The fourth type of offering is flowers and plants. Flowers are a beautiful way to show appreciation and respect for the divine forces, and they can be used as offerings in many rituals. When giving flowers or plants as an offering, it is important to choose something that is of good quality and that is suitable for the deity or energy that is being honored. For example, if you are honoring a goddess of love, you might choose a bouquet of roses or a potted plant with fragrant herbs.

> **Flower petals** and various flower or **fruit arrangements** always make a great offerings.

## 5\. Candles

Lastly, you can offer a spirit a **candle in a corresponding color** and with its name carved into it or any symbols related to it. If no colors are given for the spirit, look at its planetary correspondence and choose the color of the corresponding planet.

##### For example, it's Friday, the day of Venus. Therefore, you can present offerings to Venus. It doesn't have to be too elaborate from what I've mentioned:

## Venus Friday Offering Ritual

1.  A square of chocolate 🍫

2.  A pour or two of juice in a glass 🍷

3.  A colored candle carved with its name and symbols if desired

4.  Incense, if it likes it

5.  Lastly, lighting the candle in love and gratitude to the spirit. 🕯️

6.  Your feelings of love and gratitude are a blessing to the spirit, but you can also charge the spirit along with its offerings by blessing them with energy, for example, white light, or however you desire to do so. 💖🌟

*(Note: Wash any glasses or plates you may want to reuse after the offerings. Optionally, you can use glasses, plates, and trays specifically for offerings. Always try to intuitively feel out how much the spirit wants of each offering.)*

> From this, you can see that working with spirits is really intuitive work. But, the more you're able to perceive what it wants and how it wants it, the more rewarding it can be. And the better your life as you continue to build up this relationship over time.

Giving offerings is an important part of many rituals and it is a way to show respect and appreciation for the divine forces. **No matter what type of offering you choose, it is important to choose something of good quality and that is suitable for the deity or energy that is being honored.** *With this guide, you now know the basics of giving offerings in witchcraft and magick.*
