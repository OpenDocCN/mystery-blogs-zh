- en: veryone learns best by doing. The ritual described below is representative of
    the rituals worked in modern magic. It should be used as a general pattern indicating
    the essential elements and sequence of rituals, and will also, I hope, be of some
    value in awakening a magical perception of the world, which in no small measure
    consists of just being aware that it is possible to see the world in a new way.
    Because few people reading this essay will possess a full set of ritual tools,
    I have designed it so that it does not require any instruments except the flame.
    It can be worked in any private place where there is half an hour of quiet. *note*:this
    is not my spell I found this spell from an other website And I just want to share
    this spell

    shoes, and anything that hinders a free circulation of blood or irritates the
    skin. It is best if, before beginning, you bathe, or at least wash your hands
    and face. Remember, you are invoking a spiritual awareness into the temple of
    your body.

    of the circle with the beginning in your mind. If necessary, mentally expand the

    heart center. The vertical beam of the cross is red, and runs between your feet
    and through the top of your head to infinity. The horizontal beam running under
    your shoulders is blue. The horizontal beam which enters your chest between your
    clasped palms and exits your back is yellow. Your heart center blazes with a clear
    white light that fills your entire body as if it were a glass vessel.

- en: Sit upon the floor before the candle and contemplate the flame. Let your breathing
    be light and regular. Be aware of the turbulence in the air and wait for it to
    be completely stilled, so that the flame rises straight up in a cone with hardly
    a flicker. You should be far enough away so that your breath does not disturb
    it. Try to become tangibly aware of the body and substance of the flame from all
    angles. Involve yourself with it. Imagine that you are surrounded by it, and that
    it does not discomfort you in the least. The sensation is like being encased in
    an upwardly flowing teardrop of sunlight.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gradually let your breaths grow deeper and longer without forcing them or straining
    yourself. Remain relaxed. As you inhale fully, hold your breath for five or 10
    seconds and focus your awareness solely upon the uppermost point of the flame,
    where it vanishes into nothingness. Try to focus like a microscope of infinite
    power ever more finely upon the exact place where the transition between flame
    and space occurs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you release your breath, let your mind once again embrace the entire body
    of the flame. The next time you inhale, again halt your breath for a few seconds
    and focus upon the tip of the flame. Try at each stoppage of breath to get ever
    closer to the elusive vanishing point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is vital to the success of this technique that you do not strain yourself
    by trying to breathe too deeply, or retain your breath too long. If you end up
    short of breath that is where your attention will be, and the whole purpose will
    be defeated. It may require several practices before a light, effortless rhythm
    of breaths and retentions can be established. I cannot stress enough that the
    actual length of the retention, or the number of retentions, is of no importance
    whatsoever. Only the rhythmic shifting of your awareness from the body of the
    flame to its vanishing point is of significance. At each focus upon the tip of
    the flame, try for at least a fraction of a second to direct all your perception
    and will upon the dimensionless margin where it disappears out of the universe.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I chose this ritual because it is not dangerous, and so requires no banishing
    formula. Since it is worked primarily in the astral by visualization it can be
    done without magical instruments. However, it is still a very potent ritual. If
    you work it each day for several weeks, you should notice subtle yet unmistakable
    changes in your awareness. The ritual purpose has deliberately been left unspecified
    in order to promote those transformations most natural to each individual. A general
    stirring of higher perceptions, as well as an increase in vitality, are to be
    expected. Other effects will depend on the personality and abilities of the person
    using the ritual. For a lasting change, it should be worked regularly for several
    months.
