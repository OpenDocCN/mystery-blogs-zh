    and where it hurts once they have described it or if its an animal you use your
    intuition or watch how it walks. Next you need to visulize the human or animal
    body and make it look like a ghost with an white aura around the body and once
    you have imagine blue roots in the body and imagine the part that hurts and visulize
    it being red and focus on it fadeing back into blue and soon after if you beileive
    that it worked he or she or it will be good as new literally it works anybody
    can do even a 5 year old child can do it they can do it to anybody and everbody
    can do it.

- en: This needs an edit. It sounds like basic energy healing, but if the person has
    a broken leg, it will not be ''good as new'' if you try this. Energy healing clears
    energy blocks which can affect the physical. It is not energy stopping internal
    bleeding.
