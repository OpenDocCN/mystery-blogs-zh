- en: When you are finished, read over what you wrote and confirm that everything
    you want to say is included. When you are certain it is as you wish, spend some
    time meditating on your goal while you light your ritual fire or the charcoal.
    When you get ''that feeling'' (the one when you know everything is right, your
    will is focused, you know it is certain, you know the feeling...) prepare to begin
    the physical aspect of the ritual. When the fire has become coals, or the charcoal
    is glowing happily, read aloud your writing, repeating it 3 times. As you read,
    or as you come to the end of each repetition, sprinkle a small handful (about
    a tablespoon) of the Moon Incense on the fire. You will want to be practiced at
    this for the best effect as well as safety, so make up a full recipe of it and
    accustom yourself to its nature prior to the rite.

- en: Fold the paper and keep it near you for three days. Keep it under your pillow,
    mattress, or pinned to your night clothes (if you aren't sky/star clad) while
    you sleep. After three days, light another ritual fire, repeat the Circle of Power/Protection,
    reading and incense procedure and this time, burn the paper when you are done.
    OR you can keep the paper in a special spell box if you use this method. Many
    witches have special containers to keep finished workings in. These are usually
    decorative and personalized with engravings or painting on them that echo their
    contents. For example, a heart shaped heartwood box with runes and magickal symbols
    of love on it for this spell. Usually only similar spells are kept together, or
    each spell is kept in its own box.
