    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [turquoise](https://wiccanow.com/turquoise-the-beautiful-stone/).
    Today I thought we’d focus on another beautiful crystal, namely Fluorite.

- en: '**Used since ancient times, fluorite takes its name from the Latin *fluere*,
    meaning “to flow”. Its colour can range from transparent to almost all shades
    of the colour spectrum and it has a vitreous lustre. Most types of fluorite exhibit
    strong fluorescence and some types will even glow in the dark when heated. Traditionally
    the mineral was used in both ancient China and Egypt to fashion a wide range of
    ornamental objects as well as industrially to process metals.**'
