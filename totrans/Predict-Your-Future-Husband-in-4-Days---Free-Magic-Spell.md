 Tonight, put five bay leaves under your pillow. This is best done on Valentines Day, but can be done any other day as well. Then youll have a dream of your future lover or husband.
Then, make an infusion but dont drink it. If youre allergic to any ingredients, dont use them. But remember you wont be drinking.

Get a chalice or blessed cup, and put a little amount of basil (which resembles spicing up your love life), calendula (for joy), sugar (for a sweet man and a sweet relationship), cinnamon, fennel, oregano, ketchup (the tiniest of amounts), yarrow, and lavender. (Put in a little water or tea.) If you cant get all of these things, use as many as you can find. Then put a little salt. Dont put in any lemon, even if its your signature. You dont want, as Ive said in many of my spells, a sour marriage!

Then put in a little apple juice into your mix. Remember to give a whole apple outside, to the nearest tree, for Aphrodite if you want a beautiful relationship. If you dont need an apple, give some rosemary, a rose, a cinnamon stick, or a little ginger.

Give a bowl of strawberries to the goddess Hathor. Then give yourself one ripe strawberry. Chant, if you wish.

Dont give your infusion in your blessed cup to anybody you dont love, not even to yourself. Dont even give it to the gods or goddesses-yet! Then, in three days, go outside and give the cup with your infusion. Pour some on a tree, or the grass, for the god Eros. Then give the cup with the infusion to Aphrodite the goddess.

Ketchup?

Yes, ketchup. it represents the bloody vengeance you will enact should your partner cheat... Or maybe red for love, honestly the whole thing seems flawed to me. I'd take half and make it into a marinade for a romantic meal with the person you want to marry. The rest I would either omit or bake into a pie [seriously, just bake your would-be wife/husband an apple pie and focus on a happy life together as you make it. All of the ingredients work for a love spell]
