Empower for information, wisdom, and understanding. Sprinkle into the opening of the potato. Add three drops of vanilla. Empower for stated purpose. Place one nail in the potato to seal the spell. Set outside in the sun. As the potato rots, the evil will break down and understanding will come. If you are doing this during the cold months of the year, when it won't be possible for the vegetable to rot, use a sweet potato instead and bake in your oven until soft. At a place with moving water, remove the nail and throw the potato into the water. Dispose of the nail in a dumpster off your property.
