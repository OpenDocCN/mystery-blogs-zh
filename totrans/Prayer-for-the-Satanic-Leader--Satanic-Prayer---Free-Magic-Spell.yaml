- en: Lord Satan Mighty One Wisdom Incarnate, Speaker of Knowledge I ask that you
    bestow your blessings on the leaders of our Satanic Community Guide us, so we
    will serve you in the ways that you desire Give us strength, to keep us going
    when things get tough Bestow upon us wisdom, so we will know what to do in all
    situations Inspire us to encourage one another, instead of tear each other down
    So we will use our words to bless instead of curse Yet push us to stand tall when
    we face things that are wrong To fight if we have to, yet strive for peace Help
    us, Father, to be there for your children-both the adept and the new To guide
    them in learning what you have for them To encourage them not to follow anyone
    but you and to find their own path Let us not forget what it was like when we
    first came to you How you were gentle, kind and patient May we follow in your
    footsteps To love as you love, teach as you teach We are happy to be your servant;
    reveal to us the hidden things Try us; so we may be worthy of your affairs that
    you place in our hands Bestow on us your covenant as we trust in you Let us receive
    your counsel, not acting unless it is your will It is an honour to serve you,
    Lord Satan Thank you for choosing us May our lives be devoted to you; may we be
    a reflection of who you are to the world Watch over us and bless your people Lord
    and Mighty Satan, may it be done according to your will
