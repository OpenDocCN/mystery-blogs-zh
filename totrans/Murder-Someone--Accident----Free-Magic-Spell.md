**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Picture of person

*   Black candle

*   Scissors

 Take the candle and light it. Then pick up the picture of the intended and look into his or her eyes, and imagine them dying. Then take the scissors and cut the photog into tiny pieces. Pick them up and hold them in you hand. Put piece by piece onto the flame while saying

"This one. This (persons name) has hurt me. It is with great pleasure that he/she shall die. Once they are gone, I shall feel no remorse, feel no pain. This is how it was meant to be. Mess with me once, my blame. Mess with me twice, your flame. Kill him/her now, spare him/her no mercy. This is the will of all, so it shall be."

Let the photo pieces shrivial up and smile evily while gazing upon the flames, watching the person's picture burn and crumple. Think bout how much you hate them, and how happy you'd be when they die.

does it work

Doubtful. Curse them maybe, but a death spell would take a lot more energy and wouldn't be so simple.

This is way too simple for it to even work, if you want someone dead just use goofer dust

Please elaborate on the dust?

Just for advice: do not use your hand to pick something that already negatively energized or cursed, use tweezer or pliers to pick up and make sure you use gloves for protection do not touched on skin. and also just where power supply or energy source for this spell?

As outlined, this does not work. If you charge enough hatred, you could hex them, but they will not die.

I'm a believer of someone cannot be killed until it is time for them to die. I think this spell might give them bad luck but not kill them.
