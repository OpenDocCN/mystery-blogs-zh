    practices Buddhism. Warlock means oathbreaker and nobody goes with it. Witch is
    gender neutral so the vast majority use the term witch. No spell will make you
    one, practicing will.

    as many times as they please [including the person who posted it] and unless it's
    been fixed, there was a glitch where spell votes only went up, not down [it worked
    at one point, i just remember it being an issue in the past year] long story short,
    older spell, more votes.

- en: regarding this specific one, a spell doesn't make you a witch, your actions
    do. practice witchcraft and you will be a witch. practice daily to become a ''more
    powerful'' witch. there is no quick-fix solution for a religious/spiritual path.

- en: This does not work. The words ''witch'' and ''warlock'' are just titles, used
    by people who choose to use them, and nothing more. No spell makes someone into
    either. If someone practices witchcraft, they may choose to call themselves a
    witch. Some people have a magic practice and decide to describe themselves as
    a warlock. Nothing more than that.
