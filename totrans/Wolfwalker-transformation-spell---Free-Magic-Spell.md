Sir, I don't understand what you mean by'' to memorising the spell''. Kindly, explain it, please.

The user who made this isn't around anymore [they deleted their account] but I assume they're referring to the belief you should memorize spells. Many witches believe it's better to memorize the spell/chants before casting so you don't keep pausing to find your place. Personally, you should read over the spell a few times so you know what it says, but if you still read it off a piece of paper, that's fine. So long as you're not reading it for the first time and go ''All I have is... In... Incom... *googles word*'' you should know what the chant means. Otherwise, there's no conviction behind your words, the energy is weak, and there will be gaps in the magick.

This is fake and does not work. You cannot physically transform. If this is a dreamscape type transformation, it still does not work. The chant makes no sense, and there is no Magik behind the chant.
