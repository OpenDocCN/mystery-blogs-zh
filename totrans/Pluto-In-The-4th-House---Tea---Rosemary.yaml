    categories.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you probably had a mother who was destructive in some way, whether
    she was an addict or had a mental disorder. She probably spun out of control on
    a regular basis and appeared to be quite weak. You may have wished that she would
    be stronger.
  prefs: []

    event that was extremely traumatic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, you felt as though you did not have personal power as a child. You
    never found a sense of peace in your intimate world and did not have parents who
    were there for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also had to care for other people from a young age. With Pluto in the 4th
    house, you were forced to take on too much responsibility because the adults in
    your life didn’t step up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This placement usually indicates that your caretakers acted like children themselves
    in some way. You didn’t get the support you needed, but you also had to act like
    an adult when you were too young.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These responsibilities make your family home quite exhausting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    else. You’re afraid of vicariously reliving that trauma through another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    You may want to do things differently as a parent but you could take this to extremes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for yourself. You can never be fully vulnerable with someone because you must
    always guard your heart so that you never experience the pain of childhood again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    as an adult), then you may strongly fear change because you don’t want to lose
    this security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Pluto in the 4th house, you could also be afraid of where you come from
    and of going back to your roots. However, these feelings may cause guilt, so you
    repress them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also be obsessed with your family in some way. Family is what created
    you the most pain, yet you also fixate on family, whether this is your family
    of origin or the family you try to create later as an adult.

    someone else, you can put everything else aside to do it.
  prefs: []

    to you.
  prefs: []

    what’s happening. You simply find yourself unable to completely open up and feel
    vulnerable.
  prefs: []

    you can also become controlling or domineering *yourself* as an adult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don’t work through your issues with Pluto in the 4th house, you may find
    that you control those in your household. You unconsciously want to be the “head
    of the house” to make sure that you never experience that trauma from childhood
    again.
  prefs: []

    yourself.

    to deal with your demons. You probably have some serious karma to work through.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    so young. However, this also means that it is even more painful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    system, yet you must *transform* the way that you use this power.

    You will find that things happen in your family system to force you into this
    transformation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way to begin is by reliving the most painful periods of your childhood and
    confronting the false judgements that you made as a child, often about yourself
    and your self worth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Only then can you begin to let others in to see the true *you*. Instead of hiding
    your fear with anger or manipulation, you must learn how to share your vulnerable
    feelings with others who you can trust.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Transform with Pluto in the 4th house by sharing your fears. You try to keep
    your fears locked down so that you’re never hurt, but you can never then have
    an honest relationship with another person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have a hard time accepting yourself with this placement. Sometimes, psychotherapy
    or intense inner work can aid you on your journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Delve into the traumas caused in childhood in order to realize that *none* of
    it was your own fault. This will then teach you how to give up control so that
    you can have familial relationships that are on equal footing.
