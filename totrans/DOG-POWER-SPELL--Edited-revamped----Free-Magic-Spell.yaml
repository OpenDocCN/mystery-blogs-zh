- en: This spell will not turn into a dog, however you will have all the abilities
    of a dog, good and bad. BE CAREFUL THIS IS NOT A JOKE. If you are willing to transform
    your spiritual self into this Canis lupus familiaris species, you must be 100%
    sure about it. THIS IS A VERY STRONG IRREVERSIBLE SPELL. DO NOT TRY IF YOU ARE
    NOT 100% SURE YOU WANT THIS. Revamp/edit of my dog power spell. Feel free to add
    it to your BoS or spell book!

    in the room you will be performing the spell. Place the dog hair on the towel
    and put it in front of you. You should be sitting down on the floor and the dog hair
    should be right in front of you. If you have long hair, I suggest you have it
    in a ponytail. The room you will be casting the spell should be completely dark
    and only have the light of the candles.

- en: As mentioned in the previous dog power spell, this is fake and does not work.
    Even if this claims you will not physically transform, a spell cannot enhance
    your human abilities to that of a canine permanently. That still defies natural
    law. And it still says ''balancing tail'' which leads me to believe you would
    get a tail if you cast this spell, and since that too defies nature, it is further
    proof the spell is fake.
