    the white at the top, and the other colors anywhere. Take your hair (or other
    thing)and put it in the middle. Take your cloth bag and put it in the middle also.
    Make sure to remember the spell because you have to concentrate on the candles
    and not the book or paper you read the spell off of.

- en: The strand of hair is a money charm [if you are worried about losing it, I would
    place it in a tiny jar, envelope, ziplock bag, or other container to carry with
    you] if you're concern is your hair falling out or turning green or something,
    nothing will happen to the hair.

- en: Has anyone tried this spell? I know it says it shall be fair. In the past, though,
    these usually have ''backfire'' of something like a person dies so you get an
    inheritance, or a car accident happens and you get a settlement
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that isn't the spell backfiring. Some spells can work that way. If you didn't
    specify and asked for a large sum of money, sometimes a spell will take the inheritance
    route. Hence why most spells include the line ''harm to none'' but you have to
    consider ''harm'' can include taking a job from someone else. It's best to weigh
    the options before casting so you're aware of the possible outcomes. [it's equally
    possible you could get injured and sue someone, but have a permanent injury]
