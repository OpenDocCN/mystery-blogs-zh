# 'Elemental Protection Spell'

  Rated 5/5 Stars

Uses the elements to protect you. This is from my very own spell book. I have tried it and it seems to be very potent. If it doesn't work for you then you might want to adapt it to your own purposes, but it should be fine.

 ## Casting Instructions for ''Elemental Protection Spell''

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**Focus your thoughts and energies on remaining safe and calm. Do this for several minutes. When you feel connected with your energy and your mind, cast the circle and say the following:

Terra, Ignis, Aqua
All Three
Elements of astral, I summon thee
Earth by divinity, divinity by earth
Give thy enemy the power to see
The strength of the elements by my side
Rules of magic, I shall abide
Now, when my enemy meets his/her/its downfall
This spell will have no power at all
In no way will this spell reverse
Or place upon me any curse
As Above--So below, Blessed Be!
