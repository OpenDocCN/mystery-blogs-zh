    Once there is enough wax, splash the mirror with wax. Sprinkle salt around the
    mirror and yourself. Set up the candles around you, and be very quiet. Once the
    was is dry, with the knife/razor (be careful not to scratch the mirror) carve
    in the wax the type of spirit/demon whatever... psychic/family member/demon/any
    other spirit. OPTIONAL, not suggested: with the knife/razor put some of your blood
    on the mirror. Now chant:'

    want, you can ask it questions through forms of you asking, the spirit knocking.
     **USE CAUTION** because if you do choose to use blood or put 666, be aware of
    the dangers. For us, there were bugs appearing out of nowhere. After you're done,
    clean up the mess, like wax and anything else off the mirror.
