- en: They are normally seen in places a person has become attached, these can be
    called "inner child" of the person who died. This is something people can interact
    with, without feeling afraid, they will show you the best parts of a person's
    life, they are immensely interactive. This would be quiet a treat if you encounter
    one, but you will need one who is "awake" to view the stored memories.
