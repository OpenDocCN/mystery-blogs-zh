- en: What you want to do now, is to cup your hands around the object and imagine
    energy flowing through your hands. Don't use your own energy because you will
    get tired easily, instead use another source of energy. And imagine your self
    obtaining energy from that. I use the sun as my energy source because it is full
    of energy, and my element is fire.

- en: Imagine the object moving in your mind. This is the hard part though, don't
    stress too much or focus on it too much, or have little focus on it. Just imagine
    that your doing something simple, like typing on the keyboard or something. Just
    keep doing that, and don't worry if it doesn't work for the first time! It also
    happens to me as well.

- en: Congrats! You just did basic telekinesis! Just practice doing this daily, and
    soon you might be able to do telekinesis without too much pressure I also recommend
    meditating for about 15-30 minutes a day, it just helps you focus more. Message
    me if this spell works!

    want to see if others can too. Also, it gave my hand a weird feeling, almost like
    pain.

    something stupid?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Careful with banned language [last word in your question, while directed at
    you, is considered hate speech] but outside of being 13 or older to be on this
    site, there's no age requirement. I would go with a skill requirement. If you've
    been practicing for a week and want to summon Cthulu, maybe wait a bit, but if
    it's something like light a candle and say a chant, I don't see the harm. Use
    your judgement. If you think you're ready to try a spell, give it a go [just shield
    and maybe cast a circle first to be safe] Reading over this, it's a practice for
    beginners, you should be fine.

- en: Telekenisis is not real. This spell outlines charging items with energy, then
    adds nonsense of moving them with your mind. You can charge objects with energy.
    You need to be careful not to drain your bodys energy. You cannot move objects
    with your mind.
