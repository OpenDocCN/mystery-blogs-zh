    and lock the door. Go into the bath (I''d recommend sitting down as your legs
    might feel weak). Have the water in your chosen glass and dump the salt into it.
    Stir the water until the salt has dissolved. Swish your necklace or bracelet in
    the salt water and put it on. Now drink the salt water and immediately say: Mermaids,
    Mermaids, of the deep. I have a wish I would like you to hear. I wish to be a
    mermaid of (say your tail color here) and I wish to be able to (say freeze, boil,
    or move water). Please hear my request and grant my wish. I wish to be a mermaid.'

- en: Now keep your necklace on at all times and whenever you touch water you will
    grow a tail. You should be able to use the freezing, boiling, or water movement
    powers at all times, as long as your necklace is on. If you take your necklace
    off for more than 24 hours you will lose your powers and will have to repeat this
    process all over again. If you do this spell on a full moon you will have stronger
    powers on the full moon and weaker powers on the new moon and vice versa.
