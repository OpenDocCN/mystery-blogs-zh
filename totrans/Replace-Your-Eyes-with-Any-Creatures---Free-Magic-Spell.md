Read all before doing:
Draw a pair of eyes. After drawing the eyes draw the iris and pupils of the creature.
Color them to what your heart contents.
Fold the paper anyway once.
Write down its info. (Kind of eyes, what creature they came from, kind of powers you want, etc.)
Fold the paper anyway again.
Write and say, ''Eyes eyes, come to me, replace my old eyes with (creature) eyes. I wish for (creature) eyes on the physical plane. So Mote It Be.'' (''So Mote It Be'' should be written as big as you can.)
Fold paper anyway.
Draw a pentagram.
Fold it once more.

Every night, for three nights, chant

1x: God, please grant the dream eyes I wish to have.

10x: Eyes eyes, come to me replace my old eyes with (creature) eyes. I wish for (creature) eyes on the physical plane. So Mote It Be.

After chanting the three nights, go look in a mirror. If your eyes changed, have fun with your new eyes! If they're still the same, try again.
