Awaken within me the gifts that sleep
Give unto me these gifts I reap"

This might work, but you do not have hidden powers. You might not understand your potential, and while there are rituals to help you awaken to these facts and reach a new spiritual level, it does not mean you are secretly psychic or something. When you ''awaken'' it means you move to a deeper spiritual level, similar to newbie, beginner, advanced. You have grown on your path. You can also meditate on this question, or use divination to help you find direction.
