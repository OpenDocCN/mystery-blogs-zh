  zh: 琼·维特于1775年出生在康沃尔州博德明。她有时被称为“斗争的仙女”或“维特（白）女巫”。
- en: Joan was famed as a [**clairvoyant**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-magick/related-clairvoyance/),
    and people would seek her services as a seer, [**diviner**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/divination-fortune-telling/related-divination/)
    and healer. Her healing practices included the use of “clooties” (or “clouties”),
    strips of cloth taken from a sick person and tied to a tree or a holy well as
    a form of sympathetic [**magic**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-magick/terms-magic/),
    such that when the cloth rots, the disease was believed to dissipate.

  zh: 琼以[**透视能力**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-magick/related-clairvoyance/)而闻名，人们会寻求她作为预言者、[**占卜者**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/divination-fortune-telling/related-divination/)和治疗师的服务。她的治疗实践包括使用“克卢蒂”（或“克洛蒂”），这是从病人身上取下的布条，系在树上或圣井旁，作为一种类似[**魔法**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-magick/terms-magic/)的共鸣形式，当布条腐烂时，疾病据信会消散。
- en: Later in life, she became very ill-tempered as a result of a tooth abscess,
    and would shout and rail at people. She often became involved in fights where
    she exhibited remarkable strength and people came to believe she was possessed
    by the devil. She was eventually incarcerated in Bodmin Jail, not for witchcraft
    but for public brawling, and due to poor conditions in the jail, Joan died of
    bronchial pneumonia at the age of 38.

  zh: 后来，由于牙齿脓肿，她变得非常暴躁，并且会对人大声叫嚷。她经常卷入斗殴事件，展示出非凡的力量，人们开始相信她被魔鬼附身。最终，她因为在公共斗殴中而被关进博德明监狱，而不是因为巫术，由于监狱的恶劣条件，琼因支气管肺炎去世，享年38岁。
- en: 'Her bones were disinterred and used for séances and various pranks, then later
    displayed at the Witchcraft Museum in Boscastle, Cornwall. It is said that, while
    her skeleton was on display in the museum, they started to experience disruptive
    poltergeists, and a witch was bought in to advise them, who said that Wytte’s
    spirit wished to be laid in a proper burial. She was finally laid to rest in a
    peaceful wooded area in Boscastle, and her gravestone reads: “Joan Wytte. Born
    1775\. Died 1813 in Bodmin Jail. Buried 1998\. No longer abused”.'

  zh: 她的骨骼被挖掘出来，用于降神术和各种恶作剧，后来展示在康沃尔州博斯卡斯尔的巫术博物馆中。据说，在她的骷髅展出时，博物馆开始经历破坏性的招魂现象，随后请来一位女巫为他们指点，她说维特的灵魂希望能够得到合适的安葬。她最终安葬在博斯卡斯尔的一个宁静的林地中，她的墓碑上写着：“琼·维特。出生于1775年。1813年在博德明监狱去世。1998年埋葬。不再受虐待。”
