  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Memory won't be an issue, you aren't going to transform into a cat, no matter
    how much you may wish it. At best, this may give you the feeling of being more
    feline, through placebo, but physical transformation isn't going to happen and
    so memory loss isn't something you will experience. It's not what you want to
    hear, but physical transformations aren't possible on this plane, look to the
    astral for more successful results.
