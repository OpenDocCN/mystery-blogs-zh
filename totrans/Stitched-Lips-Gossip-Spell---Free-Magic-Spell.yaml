    only. Use a marker to draw a face on the cloth. Try to make it somewhat resemble
    the person but you don't have to be an artist. Write their name under the face.

    face out where you can see it each day until you feel the gossiping has stopped.
    The intention of this spell is to be directed at one person, but you could do
    a more general one with no name to help keep gossip away.
