    You’ll notice that we start to shift *away* from the values of the south node
    and that these sorts of values become less popular globally.

    position. However, this isn’t how it always *actually* works out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This position is more about being trapped within *yourself* (instead of trapped
    in a specific role) and trapped by the opinions of others. It has much less to
    do with gender and much more to do with self-restriction. If you have a Libra
    south node, you don’t trust yourself to make decisions and rely on the opinions
    of others, much like the classic housewife.

    You’re very good at keeping a group together and are definitely more of a group
    person rather than an individualist. You might always want to be with others rather
    than be alone.

- en: The south node in Libra doesn’t necessarily mean that you had any *specific*
    trauma during childhood – many events can lead to a Libra south node. *Some* events
    in your childhood made you feel that you needed to rely on the opinions of others
    rather than on yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You couldn’t be yourself with your *own* identity; your childhood identity was
    always linked to other people. And this made you afraid to be alone, so you relied
    on other people, almost as an extension of yourself. In fact, you probably *coped*
    with a lot of your negative emotions by being around other people because then
    you didn’t have to think about anything painful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Libra south node means that you focus a lot of on things *look*. You might
    enjoy flattery or spend a lot of time doing things that you think others will
    approve of. You want to fit in with society. This can manifest as caring about
    expensive things, a beautiful home, makeup/looks, or even saying that right thing
    at the right time – the socially acceptable thing. The house where the south node
    in Libra sits will show *how* this desire to fit in manifests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You believe you must follow what others say due to your Libra south node; you
    struggle to think for yourself. Your impressionability might have created pain
    as a younger person, always feeling that you needed to take on the “next trendy
    thing” even if it didn’t truly fit *you*. Over time, you’ll go through many stages
    until you realize that you’ll never find satisfaction until you discover what *you*
    like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much of this is because you’re afraid of being judged. You felt judged and criticized
    or even overlooked in past lives and in childhood, and this created a trauma response.
    Now, you feel that you *must* fit in – this is a survival mechanism. You unconsciously
    feel that if you don’t fit in with the crowd, something *terrible* will happen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Libra south node means that your happiness depends on other people. If those
    around you are having a bad day, you will be physically affected. And your confidence
    can be *easily* shattered when you identify with others because you don’t have
    a strong sense of self to fall back on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The south node in Libra means that you’re an empath. You’re *extremely* sensitive
    to the energy of those around you, which is one of the reasons why you feel a
    strong need to keep the group together. But by doing this, you sacrifice a piece
    of yourself.
  prefs: []

    and be your own person. You are perpetually stuck. But even when you realize this,
    you spend a lot of time *thinking* about breaking free rather than just *doing *it.
  prefs: []

    others because you’re always forced to be the caretaker. But what you don’t realize
    is that the power lies within *you*.

    opinions of others before making decisions and can’t figure out how to stop doing
    this.

- en: The south node in Libra can *also* mean that you feel the need to win over others
    through subtle forms of manipulation. You do this trying to “take back” your sense
    of self, yet you don’t know how just do what you want. You feel that you must
    manipulate or win to retain that piece of yourself. What you *really* need to
    do is focus on your own wants, needs, and opinions rather than on winning over
    others.

- en: If you’re born under the North Node of Aries, you should learn to express your
    independence and boldness, even if you have to strain yourself at first. Aries
    natives are bold since they accept challenges without hesitating. Theirs are the
    initiating and fighting types – these are the qualities you need to integrate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must learn how to do things that are *functional*, things that feel right
    for you, even if your actions go against what society tells you to do. For example,
    focus on home design that *you* like and need rather than what others think is
    trendy. The same does for clothing, activities, looks, etc. Do what you *actually* want
    to do rather than asking the opinions of others. While this might mean that you
    become more unfashionable or different, this is essential to move towards your
    north node in Aries.
  prefs: []

- en: The north node in Aries means you must eventually take a stand for your inner
    truth. But first, you must learn to *feel *this truth. You’ve spent so many years
    seeking the opinions of others that your truth is buried deep inside. Once you
    figure out what’s true for you, only then can you *act*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must do this work individually, teaching *yourself* so that you don’t become
    yet another extension of someone else. But you can still incorporate the best
    traits of your south node in Libra by loving others while you do this work. Don’t
    forget the good Libran traits that you can take with you! It’s all about learning
    how to exist in a group while *also* retaining your own sense of individuality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At first, you may need to isolate yourself so that you can find your north node
    in Aries. It’s much harder to access when you’re around other people. So until
    you develop a stronger sense of self, you may need to spend more time alone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look inside and find your sense of self, no matter how scary this may be. The
    north node in Aries is *all* about the sense of self. This will be especially
    important in the *house* that your north node in Aries sits. The house shows *where* this
    new sense of self will begin to show and what environment you should especially
    focus on. What makes your heart sing? It might not be what others think it *should* be.

    afraid. Moving towards the north node in Aries is all about following those sparks
    even if you aren’t supported by others.

- en: The north node in Aries means that you will become a metaphorical explorer in
    this life – an explorer of yourself. But you must *act* upon the self-knowledge
    you attain to truly fulfil your Aries north node.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to access your Aries north node is to follow your body. Aries is an
    extremely physical sign, so allow your physical anxiety, your gut, and your body’s
    signals to tell you the truth that is buried deep in your mind. When others give
    you opinions, retreat and listen to you body to figure out what’s true for *you*.

    node in Aries. While we think about fighting as Arian, the need to win over others
    is actually more Libran in nature. Your south node in Libra needs to know that
    you have won the group, while your north node in Aries actually doesn’t care.

    independence and away from dependence on societal expectations. This means that

    bring in some compassion and empathy.

    any planets since that will show the qualities that will become more Arian within

    nature but can clearly be felt over time since it lasts for about 18 months. You’ll
    notice that during the north node in Aries, everyone becomes a little more violent,
    cares more about the self, and societal pressure will ease as we move away from
    Libran qualities.

    During past transits, the north node in Aries seems to correlate to big worldwide
    events like wildfires. These aren’t slow-burning, long-term wildfires. However,
    some of the biggest fires in history have happened during the north node in Aries;
    it’s a cardinal and *sudden* sign but dies off just as quickly.

    State’s chart (in the 4th house, with the Libra south node in the 10th house of
    leaders) and based on past events during this transit, I would expect at least
    some of these Arian events to take place.
