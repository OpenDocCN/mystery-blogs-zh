    cave continues to widen. then you see the exit to the cave. and now you are in
    the most beautiful place you've ever seen. The grass is green, there's a pond

    It may soar above you or walk towards you. The gorgeous animal comes nearer, and
    you attempt to touch it. Then it goes back into the bush. As you leave, you look
    in the pond and see your animal's reflection. You know it will take a while to
    develop a relationship with your animal, but it will come. Then, you exit through
    the cave.
