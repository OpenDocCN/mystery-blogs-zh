    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [moonstone](https://wiccanow.com/moonstone/) Today I thought we’d
    focus on another beautiful crystal, namely Angelite.

    Named after a celestial blue sky, Angelite was commonly used by the ancient Egyptians
    to make small vases, statues and flasks. Ground into a powder, the stone was used
    as a pigment throughout the middle ages, its particular shade of blue finding
    popularity for the depiction of heavenly skies.**'

    with the angelic realm. Many crystal witches find Angelite to be instrumental
    when interpreting messages from the other side and work with the stone to support
    many aspects of their magickal work. The benefits of the stone include:'

- en: Arrange four stones in a semi-circle. Lay with your head in the centre of the
    circle and place the fifth stone on your heart. Close your eyes and feel the energy
    of the stones as they create a vortex of angelic frequency around you. Feel yourself
    opening to the angelic realm as you focus on the stone on your heart. Allow the
    energy of the stones to wash over you. If you feel your attention is suddenly
    drawn to the stone on your heart you will know that an angel has reached out to
    you.
