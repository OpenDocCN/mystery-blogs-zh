- en: '*This is one of the books I would definitely wish I had when I was at the beginning
    of my magical journey, or maybe in the first two to three years. I think it would
    have saved me a lot of headache and "finding out the hard way".*'

- en: I absolutely loved the **openness of this book** and its honesty - which are
    two qualities that in the esoteric circles come in short supply, it feels more
    like a having talk with a witch friend, sharing each others doubts, fears, tips
    and ideas on the practice.

- en: Thorn Mooney offers really open look at the "backstage" of a private practice,
    that stays normally hidden from the sight of others.

- en: I would say this book is beginner friendly, as it doesn't really discuss anything
    that would be out of reach for starting witch, but the person who will benefit
    from it the most would be somebody who is already on the path for some time, and
    experienced elements like self-doubts, feeling disconnected from the practice,
    as that is the topics Thorn Mooney speaks a lot about in the book, so it would
    help the reader to relate to the content.

- en: I would wholeheartedly recommend this book, especially for solitary witches
    who feel like they miss that one special witch friend, they could talk to about
    their practice or experienced some roadblocks and looking for solution to be able
    to keep moving forwards.
