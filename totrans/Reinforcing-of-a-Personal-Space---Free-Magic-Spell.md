# Reinforcing of a Personal Space

In using the Goddess image as a focus this spell is representational. It uses a mirror to represent light and power and also uses numerology (the power of numbers) in the nine white candles. Nine signifies pure spirituality and therefore the highest energy available.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

 Light the incense. Place the candles in a ring around the Goddess image. Light the candles, beginning with the candle most directly before the Goddess image and each time repeat these or similar words: "Light of Luna, Protect me now".

When all are lit, hold the mirror so that it reflects the light of the candles. Turn slowly in each direction, ensuring that you throw the light as far as you can in each direction. Then spin round as many times as you have candles, continuing to project the light and say: "Goddess of love, goddess of light, Protect this space".

Pinch out the candles and put them away safely until you need to use them again. This technique is slightly unusual in that you pinch out the candles rather than allowing them to burn down. This is because it is the intensity of light which is required not the length of time it burns. This is a good way of rededicating your sacred space whenever you feel it necessary..
