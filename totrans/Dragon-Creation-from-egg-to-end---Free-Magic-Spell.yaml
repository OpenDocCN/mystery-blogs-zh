    on the physical realm. So enjoy the spell. I won't guarantee that you will get
    a dragon.

- en: Let me know if the spell works. I'm currently using this spell. Also, it's best
    to make your dragon's main abilities to be able to phase through your dragon (if
    not wanted to be touched), invisibility, and telepathy. Also, don't make your
    dragon invincible. The spell won't work if you do that. This spell is meant to
    be good and not bad. Once you find the dragon egg, keep in eye on it. Hopefully,
    your egg will hatch within a week or so. Now I involved some things that I thought
    will work cause they seem to be in a lot of places on the site. Your dragon egg
    should be in your back yard. If you don't have a back yard, then it should appear
    in your room or on the balcony. I'll edit this if I find out it works. Let me
    know if you guys get an egg. I will make an instruction on what to do once you
    get an egg. Once one person messages me, I'll set up an instruction on how to
    care for the dragon. You are only allowed to get one dragon. I'll also tell you
    what you dragon is if it has more than one element. Like mine, hopefully, will
    be a Silverwind breed. That's Silver and Wind dragon. I will be naming your breed.
    If you have anymore questions, message me.

    create one. At best you can make a thoughtform in the shape of a Dragon, but it
    won't be an actual Dragon, just your energy in the shape of one.
