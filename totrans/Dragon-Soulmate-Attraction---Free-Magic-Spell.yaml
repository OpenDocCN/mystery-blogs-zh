    and write it down. Once that's done focus on the great love once more, then transfer
    it into the dragon/ess. Visualize it leaving you and entering your mate. Feel
    the great bond between you and the dragon/ess. Once you are done you'll feel tired
    so you'll have to sleep to recover.

    don't like to or just will not give their real names, so why would one instantly
    be your soulmate? I also feel like soulmate isn't the right word because for this
    to work that would mean everyone has a Dragon soulmate which Idk. I mean this
    could possibly help get a Dragon's attention but from what I know Dragons aren't
    very easy to build relationships with and you would still need to build a relationship
    with them for something like this to even come close to happen. I mean maybe if
    you built a relationship with a Dragon you could have one as a ''mate'' eventually...but
    I wouldn't count on it. Interesting idea though.

- en: Shaderaven you are correct... But I do agree with dragonslove Remember all dragons
    are connected... Although they might not agree with one another the knowledge
    gets around of each being...each human...each spirit... And dragons have a fast,
    intricately connected spiritual network I speak only about what I know and comprend....
    But I think he might be on to something here

    a dragon lover by writing ''I want one'' on some paper. Unless you already work
    with dragons, I also doubt this would work to connect with them at all.
