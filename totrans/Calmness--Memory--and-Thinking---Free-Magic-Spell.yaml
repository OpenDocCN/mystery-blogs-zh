- en: 1\. This might help calm you. 2\. You cannot increase your memory with a chant
    alone. 3\. There is no ''God of Mind.'' Pick a deity that rules over intelligence.
    Regardless, simply saying ''I want people to think of me a certain way'' will
    not do much. Visualize what you want, live in accordance with that image, but
    remember some people will not like you for no reason. Nobody is universally liked.

    No one holds rule over her in particular (Zeus perhaps? Though he rules over all
    greek gods)
