    olive oil and rub on to the candle starting in the middle and going up, then starting
    in the middle going down. While purifying the candle with the oil, you want to
    recharge the candle with love and desire, so visualize love and channel all your
    emotion into the candle. After the oil is finished, take a knife and carve what
    it is you want into the candle.

- en: After finished writing in the candle, simply light it and concentrate on love
    and throw as much emotion (love) into the flame of the candle as possible, you
    may even want to add words if you wish. Sit and do this until the candle has burnt
    out. Make sure you are comfortable and won't be bothered. The more you feel sexy,
    the more this spell will work for you! Once the candle has burned out, the spell
    is finished.
