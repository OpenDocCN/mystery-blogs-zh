 As you set up your altar for the spell, place a the basket and the candles.

When ready invoke the gods of abundance and flowers/gardens. Never invoke a god you know nothing about or a god not from your own pantheon. After the invocation, perform first prayers and your give your offerings.

When ready hold you hands over the basket and start to fill it with abundant energy of green, gold and silver in color. See these energies mixing in the basket.

Now one by one take up the flowres and ritually and lovingly plave them in the basket. The black-eyed Susans will serve to strengthen, Queen Annes lace will send out positive vibrations, and goldenrod will bring prosperity and success. As you place the flowers in the basket speak the following:

"By the powers of earth, air, fire, water, soul, spirit and balance,
By the powers of the loving gods that surround me,
This basket I make, filled with love, devotion and abundance.
And with each flower I place inside it
May the power of abundance feed the flowers and my life as well."

Next light the candles. as you do think of abundance coming into your life, enough for you to be happy and sustain you. Do not be greedy.

Now take up the dollar bill and like the basket of flowers, offer it to the gods. If you do not have a dollar to spare, use play money or better still, print/draw your own magick money. Place the dollar with the flowers and candles. Allow the candles to burn down and leave the flowers on the altar till they are all but dead.

Take the flowers, candles stubs and the money and place them in a hole in the garden, offering them back to the earth, knowing they will still manifest abundance.
