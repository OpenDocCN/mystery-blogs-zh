dip the wingbones into the sacrifice blood and then place them with the corpse
do the same with the tail
sprinkle annointing oil for protection during your travel between the universes
pour the rest of the sacrifice blood over the other ingredients
pour annointing oil in the shape of any angels sigil that you wish and light it on fire while saying et vocabunt te apon angelus Domini in via usque ad hunc benedicam tibi et dimittam te hanc flammam.
next pour about a cup of more holy oil into the bowl and light it
