    or lesser, arcana of the tarot deck. They are often divided into four suits, similar
    to the suits in a deck of playing cards: cups, swords, wands, and pentacles. Each
    suit has 14 cards, with numbered cards from Ace through 10 and four court cards:
    the Page, Knight, Queen, and King.'

    card is in the minor arcana because it has the suit cups.'

    the practical aspects of existence, whereas the major arcana deals with more profound,
    spiritual, and universal themes. Each card in the minor arcana represents a specific
    aspect of life, such as love, money, work, and so on. They can be interpreted
    in different ways depending on the context of the reading and the other cards
    that appear alongside them.
