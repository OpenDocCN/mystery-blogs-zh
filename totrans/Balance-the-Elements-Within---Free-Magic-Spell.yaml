- en: Remove your arms from around yourself, and meditate in front of the candles,
    5 minutes at least. Think to yourself of all your positive and negative qualities.
    Be completely honest with yourself, no matter how much you rather not think of
    your negative qualities. During this meditation accept yourself completely, the
    good, the bad, and even the ugly. Balance cannot be attained when within yourself
    there is unbalance of yourself, when you do not accept your negative qualities
    you end up accepting more of your positive qualities. Think of it like having
    good on one side of the scale, and bad on the other, and you pushing your finger
    on the good side to make it win in weight. Let these two equal out, because without
    one, there is no other. So unless you plan on completely cancelling out your good
    and bad qualities, this spell is a keeper! Let the candles burn themselves out
    or use a candle snuffer to put them out, release the quarters and close the circle.
