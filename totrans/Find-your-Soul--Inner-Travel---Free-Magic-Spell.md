# Find your Soul, Inner Travel

  Rated 5/5 Stars

It is extremely healthy for not only your third eye but your spirit to get in personal acquaintance with your soul, it will not work for everyone because for some in a past life have betrayed the soul, so they shy themselves but anyone can still travel within themselves.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Focus

*   Belief that it can be done

*   Clear Tranquil Mind

 It may sound hard but it is actually simple, some just need to stare at a candle flame to clear the mind while others require complete silence...I found music and incense help most find a way to calmly exert their energy.

To gain focus by candle, this works best whose element is fire since it will create a stronger connection to the person. Stare at the flame, it dosn't matter how long for it takes because focus is not so quickly gained, watch the flame flicker then it begins. Don't pay attention to anything else but the flame then once that is achieved close your eyes. Once closed think of the following of your choice, a library with telaportic books, portal, waterfall, painless lava or fire anything that you can go through or can transport you automatically without your guidance. Mine is a neon waterfall surrounded by crystals while some have books that take them or portals. Imagine your teleporter and tell it to take you to where you need to go and if your just interested in seeing your soul tell it you need to see your soul. Now your journey begins in your experience I can not tell you what to expect but always know nothing is impossible once in your spiritual self and I suggest putting locks in important places to keep things safe and good luck for what you want to know is just hidden in yourself. If your going by element on the beginning of the topic, those of water may want a bowl of water to dip there hands in frequently until they are ready then close your eyes. I hope you are able to succeed since the others I brought there were in my personal life so I could find ways to help them focus better but if you need any help message me on here or my email.

How can you know which element you need for focus.

We are all of the elements, we aren't connected to only one. The writer is probably referring to those more drawn to the fire element. At various times in our life we can be more drawn to a particular element for whatever reason. If you enjoy staring at fire it will relax you more than someone who's nervous around it. If you are one of these people I might swap it out with a meditation video/soundtrack of running water, a windy day, or nature sounds to connect more with that element.

Is this meant to trigger past life regression? Yes, using a candle flame to skry can bring you into a trance state. I am skeptical of the claims in this spell, but try it and see how it goes. Remember, you might connect with one element more than another, but we are all the elements, we do not have ''an element'' as this spell suggests.
