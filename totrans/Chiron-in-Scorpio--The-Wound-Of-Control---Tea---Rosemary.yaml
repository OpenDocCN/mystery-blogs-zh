- en: Chiron in the astrology chart shows us our deepest wounds. Although healing
    this wound is a lifelong pursuit, the *journey* to healing the Chironic wound
    is a key part of our paths that shapes our personalities. Chiron in Scorpio is
    all about the wound of *control.*
  prefs: []

- en: Most Chiron wounds will be very obvious; these injuries aren’t something we
    can ignore or hide. It isn’t until we take back personal power that we can truly
    begin the healing process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Chiron in Scorpio wound is especially deep, mostly because the wound comes
    from a past life trauma.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re just beginning, you’ll need to identify the wound and figure out when
    the trauma originated before you can begin to heal the wound in an empowering
    way. Today I’ll be exploring the Chiron in Scorpio wound and ways to find the
    healing path.

- en: The Chiron in Scorpio wound was caused by a past trauma or abuse. Usually, the
    Chironic wound relates specifically to *control.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This wound is a deep trauma that you carry around without knowing exactly *what*
    it is. The Chiron in Scorpio wound creates a control problem that blocks you from
    developing natural trust and love in relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of the Chiron in Scorpio wound, you only trust control instead of trusting
    positive intentions or authentic love. You can’t understand a world where people
    *don’t* control each other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that this wound will often manifest as inner negative talk projected
    onto the self, the body, or onto other people. These are things that people to
    do try and run from the *fear* that the wound creates, although this is often
    pushed down deep.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This fear will overtake any sense of self and become an integral part of the
    personality until the Chiron in Scorpio wound is dealt with. Chiron in Scorpio
    is a very difficult wound to have, but this only makes it more important to deal
    with the wound in a healthy way.

- en: The Chiron in Scorpio wound can manifest in a variety of ways, but there are
    a few commonalities that show up for most people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In *some* sense, the Chiron in Scorpio person will have a total lack of boundaries.
    This is because they don’t understand healthy relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The wound means that the individual either needs to control others or to *be*
    controlled. This can show up physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, or
    even sexually. I find that these individuals often use sex as a means of power,
    but control extends well outside the bedroom.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chiron in Scorpio is the classic controlling partner, but it can also be the
    partner who *gets* controlled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, the individual can become paranoid, power hungry, or obsessed
    with death and darkness. These are all different attempts to control the outcome
    of something.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is always some area of the individual’s life where they either require
    control or give up control. You can learn more about *how* this happens by looking
    at the house that Chiron in Scorpio sits in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you have Chiron in the 2nd house, you’ll either control your
    finances and possessions with a tight fist, or you’ll feel controlled by the things
    you have and/or don’t have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have Chiron in the 7th house, you will either exert power over anyone
    you’re in a relationship with, or you will enter into relationships where you *give
    up* your personal power.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also find that it takes an extremely long time for anyone with Chiron in Scorpio
    to trust. Because of this, relationships aren’t easy, regardless of what house
    Chiron is in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Chiron in Scorpio don’t really believe in trust. They were hurt so
    badly in a past life that these beliefs and traumas have followed them for lifetimes.
    These folks can never really let down their emotional walls because of the deep
    fear within them.

- en: Where Does The Chiron In Scorpio Wound Come From?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that the Chiron in Scorpio wound almost always comes from a deep, painful
    past life trauma. This trauma will be something *really* dark and bad.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the house and placement, it might be physical, sexual, emotional,
    etc. I’ve seen Chiron in Scorpio placements that indicated past life murder, rape,
    suicide, torture, exploitation, abandonment, destruction, death, and more. Usually,
    this trauma involved some sort of control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason that your Chiron in Scorpio manifests in the areas of control is
    because you felt such a *lack* of control in your past life while truly terrible
    things were happening. Although it’s important to explore past lives in order
    to learn more about your Chiron, it’s also important to move forward in a healthy,
    positive way. You don’t want to get stuck in the trauma all over again.

- en: Although you experienced *real* trauma in a past life, the goal for healing
    Chiron in Scorpio is to realize that the trauma is *no longer happening*. You
    developed fear responses to deal with this trauma, but these responses are not
    serving you now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way to heal is to realize that your power is within you. It’s not necessary
    to get *or* give power through other people, because no one can take away the
    power that is within you, no matter what happens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that most “transactions” of power are just illusions. We have constructed
    societal power in order to create a hierarchy among humans, but none of this is
    true in the universal sense. We all own our energy and our souls, and no earthly
    creature can take those things away from us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When those with Chiron in Scorpio feel *self-empowered*, they no longer give
    away their power or try to overpower others. They simply have no need of either
    because they have enough power already.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning to construct healthy boundaries in all areas (relationships, work,
    home life, etc.) is a good place to start if you want to find your own power.
    “Fake it until you make it” really does tend to work for the Chiron in Scorpio
    individual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal is to eventually see relationships and sex as natural parts of life,
    as two humans simply relating to each other, not as a mechanism to get or give
    control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Chiron in Scorpio need to get out there and “get triggered” while
    actively working on their boundaries and healing control issues.
