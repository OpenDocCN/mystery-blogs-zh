    this one is my favorite. It has a beautiful cover of course, and illustrations
    that are not just decorative but also actually useful.*'

- en: I have personal aversion towards " pretty books" that show very little in depth
    knowledge and I was suspecting this one will be the case, but I am happy I was
    wrong. On the contrary, this book is right up to my alleyway - no meaningless
    fluff, just practical, realistic guidance, written by

    modern eclectic spin on classical candle magic with a few fascinating crossovers
    with sigil magic, magical squares and so on, which are very effective combinations,
    that offer a great range of flexibility to the spell-caster and would surely deserve
    a book on their own.

- en: Even-tough it is very to the point and direct writing, this is not just a recipe
    book of spells (another thing I quite dislike) but step-by-step guide with useful
    illustrations and diagrams, that are easy to read and understand even for somebody
    who has never done a candle spell before. Madame Pamita also includes a whole
    chapter on candle wax reading, which I believe is very important skills for instant
    evaluation of the spell direction and results, saving yourself potentially years
    to see how the spell turned out, most books on the topic, don't include information
    about divination methods, so I was happy to see this one does.

    would recommend with clear conscious to anyone interested in candle magic!
