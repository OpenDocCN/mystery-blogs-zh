    together as a sign of their commitment to one another. Today, we invite you to
    explore the magic of handfasting and how it can add a touch of magic to your special

- en: While handfasting ceremonies share the same heart as traditional weddings, they
    dance to the beat of a different drum. They can be purely spiritual, entirely
    legal, or a combination of both, depending on the couple's wishes and local laws.
    The key difference lies in the sacred custom of tying the couple's hands together
    with cords or ribbons, symbolizing their connection and the binding of their lives.
