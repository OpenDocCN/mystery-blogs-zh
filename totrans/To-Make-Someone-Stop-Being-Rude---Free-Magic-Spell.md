Light the candle and start with concentrating on the person's face. Close your eyes and think about the times he/she was rude to you. Then take a deep breath open your eyes and stare into the flame. Chant three times:
When you will see me (mentions the person's name)
Look at me with kindness
Or don't look at me at all
And from now on you won't be rude at me.
Let it be as it is my will
Then imagine the person smiling at you. And being kind. Then smile for positive energy and the most basic believe to it...
