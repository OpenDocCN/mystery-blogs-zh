- en: When planning magical workings, consideration needs to be given as to when the
    work needs to be performed for best effect. We need to ascertain the best time
    or day for when to perform it.Days have their own magickal associations, which
    are similar to and connected with the other tables - Candles, Colour and Incense.
    Thus they create harmony while generating power, when all are working together.
    Days are associated with and influenced by the Sun and six of the Planets.
