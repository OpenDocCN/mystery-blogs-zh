    it in the plate. Place the mirrors on the right and left the plate. They should
    be facing each other. Light the candles and place them on either side of the plate,
    but outside of the mirrors. Each mirror should have a candle behind it.

    about 3 cm. in all directions. Make 8 rays coming out from the circle, making
    a kind of sun pattern. Pour the water in the circle in the center. Watch it go
    through the rays like a stream. Do not overflow or underfill. Place silver charm/jewelry
    in the center of the circle. It should be in water.

- en: Your spirit animal is not your animal form and is not determined by your personality.
    Spirit animals are a native belief and a closed practice. Spirit guides are similar
    and not closed. Both spirit guides and spirit animals are animal spirits who guide
    and protect people on their spiritual journey, but spirit animals have deeper
    spiritual significance to native spirituality. Guides are with you for a time
    and can change as needed. You might want a wolf because it is cool, but that does
    not mean you need the wisdom of a wolf spirit to guide you at this time.
