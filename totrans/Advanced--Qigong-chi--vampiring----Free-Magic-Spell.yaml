- en: If you are a Qigong practitioner but don't have time to practice everyday because
    of work or school like me, then you will know that after a long while with no
    practice it can be next to impossible manifesting your chi again. I was just experiencing
    that problem myself. But I figured out an easy way to get yourself back on track...

- en: To begin, you hold the Jnana Mudra and feel your inner chi flowing back and
    forth like a pendulum hanging from the top of your head. Once your mind is clear
    and you can clearly feel the pendulum, imagine the person whose chi you are taking
    in your head. Picture an image of that person. You should begin to feel the chi
    in your body change shape. This is the exact way the chi was patterned in that
    persons body. When you feel this you're done. You now have fresh chi to manifest
    in your body.
