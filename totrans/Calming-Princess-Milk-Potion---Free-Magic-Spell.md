*   A pot

*   A stove

*   A wooden spoon

*   A cup for afterwards

 Set the pot on the stove and fill it with 1 & 1/2 cups of milk (you can use more or less, you'd just have to equal out the ingredients). Turn the stove on LOW Let the milk start to just slightly bubble a little bit. Then you poor 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar into the pot and stir for about 15 seconds. Now pour 1/4 cup of white sugar in and stir for another 15 seconds. Then you pour in some honey (however much you want or think you need)or if you don't have honey, you can substitute for 1/3 of a banana. (If you use the banana, make sure it's mushed up and stirable, but still just a little chunky)

Let it sit for about a minute and then turn the stove off and let the potion cool, just as you situation will cool after drinking the potion. After it's a little cooled off but still warm, pour it in a cup and say this spell before drinking: "Calm me down, safe and sound. Bring me peace, so my mind's at ease. As I say so Mote it Be."

Before taking a sip, be sure to thank the God and the Goddess. After you swallow, imagine pure peace flowing through your body. (I always keep this stuff with me just in case I get angry and can't meditate at the time)
