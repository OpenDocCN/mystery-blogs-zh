- en: I use a similar chant on the full moon, works well. Just note you're not calling
    on a Dragon to follow you everywhere, just the energies to shield you from harm
    [similar to calling on a deity for protection, the deity won't follow you everywhere,
    but they will keep an eye on you]

    stores, it's an oil made from the sap of a tree.

    and I don't know how to tell them, so I probably can't ask them to buy Dragon's
    Blood Oil. So I was just wondering, are there other, more common ingredients?

- en: You can use olive oil, or just don't dress the candle at all. Hold the candle
    and pool energy into it, then light the candle and say the chant. I use this chant
    to bless my Dragon pentacle and I don't use a candle or oil, just charge it, visualize
    the Dragons watching over me, then I leave it either on my altar or on the windowsill
    to sit in the moonlight.

    spell because it seems a little flimsy.
