    work?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It states in the spells description it turns you into a Davapeer. If this person
    is creating a servitor, then I would say there is a chance of this working since
    you design the creature and create it with your energy. However, the first line
    explaining the spell clearly says ''turns you into'' which indicates physically
    transformation, hence my comment. If someone uses this to create a servitor, it
    might work.

- en: the author didn't write about 'why it should work'? and write '(should work)'
    on the title, so this is not working, because if the author really care about
    viewers, it must be explanation why and how. its like say something and want person
    just do it without thinking, which is not good.
