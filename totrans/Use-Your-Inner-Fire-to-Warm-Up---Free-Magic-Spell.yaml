    just start over again after they leave. Close your eyes and imagine a spark in
    your chest area. Soon your stomach or heart will start to feel a bit warmer. Take
    control of this feeling and imagine the spark growing into a blaze inside of you.
    If it doesn't work right away try again, it can take a few times.

    with it. You can't pick anything up or move anything since it is on your astral
    plane, not the physical one.
