- en: 1) To start, you will need to go outside, as far from civilization as possible--the
    farthest the better. Once you get to a fairly quiet area with little wings, sit
    down in the grass and relax. You will need to meditate for as long as it takes
    for your mind to be completely clear. You'll know when you're ready when you feel
    as if you are floating away and you are one with the sounds around you.

- en: 2) Once you are ready to begin, you will need your paper and charcoal. Turn
    and hold the paper horizontally in your hands. With the charcoal, draw a pentagram
    as detailed as you can in the center of the paper. Fold it over horizontally.
    Draw a pair of reptilian eyes as detailed as you can that are boring into your
    own. Remember to stay calm and meditative.

- en: 3) Now this is where you will need your pin or needle if you brought it. You
    will need to draw the smallest amount of blood, no larger than a drop or two.
    You may prick yourself anywhere, preferably on your fingertip or hand. If you
    didn't bring a needle or pin, check your fingers. If you have a hangnail, grab
    it between your fingers and pull on it. It'll sting a little, but not terribly.
    That should draw a perfect amount of blood. If no blood comes out, try squeezing
    your finger. Let a drop of blood land in between the eyes or wipe some blood between
    them.

    the bloodstain.

    a small piece and eat it. Then, throw the knife aside and push the meat farther
    from you and closer to the paper. Do the same with the dead animal. This shall
    be your sacrifice.

- en: 7) Meditate some more whilst chewing, concentrating on the feeling of flight--a
    feeling of freedom and majesty, the wind stinging your cheeks, hunting--the thrill
    and might in killing and eating fresh meat, breathing flame--the slight burn and
    heat but pride in harnessing an untamable essence, the strength and power of the
    roar of the creature you will soon be. Take your time chewing until it is practically
    pasty. Once you have swallowed the meat, you can cease meditating.

    still be able to turn back human. However, if you somehow find other dragons,
    learn their ways, and truly become one of them, you may forget all about your
    past life as a human. You will feel as if you were a dragon forever.'

    linked my blood to you, now let my dragon dreams come true. I have eaten, though,
    and dreamed like you, now let my dragon dream come true. I know this one thing
    for a fact: that once I''m done I can''t come back. But I believe and I can see,
    so lay your magic claws on me. Only you decree, the greatest beast, upon my sacrifice
    you shall feast. I have given up so much, so I only beg for your soft touch. Dragon
    of power, dragon of might, bring my fantasies into light!"'

    You must respect them, as you are asking for a lot from them.

    week to a month. As I have said before, it is different for everyone. In order
    to keep the spell going, you must chant: "Dragon of power, dragon of might, bring
    my fantasies into light!" Every night before sleep.'

- en: 10) This is where complications may happen. Once you begin to see either stubs
    growing above your shoulder blades, large bumps growing under hair, unusual nail
    growth, oddly sharp teeth, scaly or rough skin, or all of the above, this is when
    you will need to leave the house. Pack enough food to last a month. That is all
    you will need. Unfortunately, you cannot say goodbye to anyone in your family
    as this may cause complications that will be reviewed in step 11\. Stay hidden
    and far from civilization.

- en: 11) Soon, you will be fully transformed into a dragon and be able to hunt your
    own food. Gradually, you will get used to your new body. As said before, you will
    lose memory of your human life as you go on permanently as a dragon. Every person's
    dragon form is different. Try and find other dragons, but stay far from humans.
    Scientists may trap you, etc. Humans will no longer be your friends.
