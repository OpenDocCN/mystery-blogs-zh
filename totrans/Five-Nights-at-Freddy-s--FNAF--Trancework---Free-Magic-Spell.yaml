- en: As a chaos magician, I want to emphasize personal experimentation, belief, and
    the use of whatever symbols, rituals, or systems work best for the practitioner
    (i.e. you!). The nightly incantations, the use of a candle or glowstick, and the
    focusing object can be modified and adapted to suit your preferences. This allows
    you to shape the ritual according to what resonates with you on a deeper level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This FNAF trancework, as a magic spell, relies on your belief in the effectiveness
    of the ritual — and does not need to imply a belief in these animatronics as magical
    figures, of course. The tangible experiences and knowledge gained during this
    ritual can become the measure of its success. Belief is a tool, not a rigid set
    of doctrines. Let yourself explore this magical experience in a way that aligns
    with your personal beliefs and inclinations.
