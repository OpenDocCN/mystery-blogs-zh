    may feel their strong presence, and you even "see" him or her approuching you,
    do not be afraid for dragon are not harmful beings unless you try to hurt or fight

- en: Once you've connected with your Mon-tey, laugh with them, talk with them play
    music for them, and when you play music for them you might hear them dance sometimes.
    Every dragon has a different taste in music but I'm sure he or she will love your
    music. And when you drift off to sleep, right before to start dreaming you can
    hear them speak, dragons are known to have a deep voice. once you are connected
    with your Mon-tey, everything about you changes and your life will never be the
    same.

- en: this could work for some, but a couple points, not everyone has a Dragon of
    their own, they weren't assigned at birth, and the area will feel different depending
    on the Dragon. not everyone will work with a fire Dragon, so depending on the
    element the area would feel different [cooler for earth Dragons, damp for water
    Dragons, windy for air Dragons, heaviness for chaos Dragons, so on] if you don't
    get a response right away, i would go home and meditate daily, calling to your
    guardian Dragon, try astral projection, or look up a guided meditation to connect
    with the Dragons.
