Why ruin my favourite type of instant oatmeal with ham and soy sauce? [and microwave it?!] I would omit the ham part, make the oatmeal, charge it with energy, and eat it mindfully while visualizing your desired outcome.

This is not a spell. This is not even appetizing. But, if this appeals to you, you can set your intention and charge it with energy while making it and turn it into a spell of sorts.
