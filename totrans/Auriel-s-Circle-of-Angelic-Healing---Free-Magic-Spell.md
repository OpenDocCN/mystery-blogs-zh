## Casting Instructions for 'Auriel's Circle of Angelic Healing'

First raise power by either dancing or singing or some combination of the two, thou singing and chanting are best for this spell.
Cast a circle, marking the four quarters with the 4 candles, anointed in rose oil. These candles may be plain white or yellow beeswax but must be anointed in the rose oil. On the Eastern candle etch the alchemical sign for earth with either wand or athame. On the southern candle enscribe the symbol for Water, on the Western candle the symbol for Earth and on the north Fire.
As you call in each quarter, say these words:
I call on Uriel, Angel in the North, Regent of the Sun and Protector of Magick, I call thee to bear witness. Please lend the all sight of your flaming gaze.
I call on Raphael, Angel of the East, light bearer And divine healer, I call thee to bear witness. Please protect me with thine healing hand.
Next:
I call on Michael, angel of the South, Prince of Heaven and Knight of Valor and Justice, I call thee to this sacred circle. Please guard it with flaming sword and stalwart shield.
I call on Gabriel, angel of the West, Aegis of Women and Protector of Peace. I call thee to this sacred circle. With Lily in hand, lend they gentle Grace.
Between each candle quarter place a quartz.

Once the circle is raised, light from the northern candle a fire and place it in the bowl. Take time to center again and then take the ink and paint alchemic symbols of Fire in 3 bands of equal distance from wrist to elbow on your left arm. On the right paint the symbols for Water.
Now gather the rose blossoms and focus energy in your palms, through the candles, crystals and sigils, from the divines that have gathered.

Say these seven lines, dropping a rose blossom in the flame at the end of each and focusing on the end result of your healing.
At the dawn, man fell and all of Earth lay wounded.
But the gentle Watchers saw the pain visited unfairly upon infant man.
And in kindness and grace, they offered boon of heaven to ease the wounds of sin.
Leaves of Healing from the trees beside the river Euphrates, Myrrh from the Lost Land of Ophrah.
Wings of Seraphim offered as shield from the storm wind, as light in the dark.
Bless me with healing that I may share the gifts of creation.
Let this healing be brought on feathered wing by divine grace that all glory may ascend with the smoke and flame.
With each petal imagine the sparks and burning flame gathering about the marks on your arms and in your palms. Feel the sympathy the angels offer. Release all this gathered energy at the final verse and then lift the circle in the proper fashion.
