    be given major responsibilities. It might be a job or a position in any company

    discipline, and rationality in our interactions. Relationships centered on this
    tarot card may be fairly conventional, and sometimes suffocating if not handled
    appropriately.

    also struggle to communicate their emotions. This card can also represent a person
    driven by ego, who is dominant and bullying others and unable to sympathize with
    them.

    to handle events.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the Emperor assumes the opposite position, he may be more strong and more
    dogmatic in his beliefs. The card may represent an overuse and misapplication
    of the authoritative power that surrounds you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might be from you or from someone else, most often your boss, boyfriend,
    or father figure. It might also be linked to deep concerns or father issues from
    childhood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you see a reversed Emperor, it is probably time to look for those relationships
    that are no longer serving you and exit them. If you can’t think of anything like
    this, then maybe it is you who are the one exercising too much dominance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    been weak in these traits at work, you may have noticed that it’s affecting your
    projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This card might also indicate rigidity and bureaucracy in your workplace. Because
    the methods required to achieve anything have been lengthy and irritating, this
    may limit your feeling of creativity and motivation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the worst-case scenario, the reversed Emperor can point to a senior employee
    or supervisor who governs the workplace like a dictator. If this is the case,
    starting looking for work elsewhere could be a good idea.

    symbolism.

    good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to
    have a good interpretation for the moment.

    each reading, deck, person, position, and question differs. Reading the cards
    is an art, not a science.

    is replacing the mountains with a towering bridge. Still powerful and sturdy,
    but also indicates the need to get across something.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scene is stormy, indicating that there’s something troubling going on. The
    emperor here is much more sinister. Power corrupts. The older tarot symbolism
    takes a more naive view that the Emperor’s good nature prevents this corruption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This draws out a new meaning: when the emperor appears look at how you’re controlling
    things. Look to where you have power. No matter how much you think you’re trying
    to act benevolently, understand how your power could skew these intentions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This modern take makes us think about corporations and bureaucracy. Are there
    systems in place that are hindering your progress?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Maybe it’s time to figure out how to exit these systems and take power back:
    too much social media in your life swaying you in ways you can’t even understand
    yet. TV and news and corporate media make you fear things and buy things.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    appearing gives us a chance to take a moment and understand this and make the
    conscious decision that we’ve had enough.
