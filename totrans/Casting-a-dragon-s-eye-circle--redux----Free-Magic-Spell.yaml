- en: The spell has several uses much like any traditional circle you would draw,
    and can include; protection, healing, cleansing of a sacred space, and of course
    as preparation for working a spell or rite/ritual. As such the circle will follow
    the intent you hold while making it so feel free to incorporate the process into
    other magics you wish to perform. Typically I draw this circle as a stand-alone
    when I want to create a small place of power by tapping into elemental energy
    and the earth's ley-lines/dragon-lines. The shape of the dragon's eye sigil is
    designed to focus energy to a single point, and the circle acts to hold that energy
    within its boundary.

- en: To make a temporary or one-time use circle, simply draw it wherever is most
    convenient for what you intend to do. Ideally it should be a place where you are
    not likely to be disturbed for the duration of your working. A natural setting
    where you can make the circle a part of the ground such as in earth among trees,
    in sand at a beach, or in chalk on the stone of a cave or cliff/rock is all the
    better. For a more permanent circle, you can draw it into a large cloth or heavy
    fabric to carry around with you and place where needed. Or of course you can incorporate
    the circle into your altar room, perhaps on a throw rug.

    representation of your connection to and ownership of the circle. Any medium works,
    so pick based on where the circle is. Mark the ground with a branch or knife for
    earthen places, chalk for a harder surface or one you don't want damaged/carved. A
    thin line of salt will also do in a pinch.

    to it that is measured to half your height. Then just go around the circle with
    it stretched out to draw a smooth one every time.'

- en: 2) imagine a clock face on the circle, with 12:00 being oriented at north. Estimate
    as close as you can three points on the circle, and mark them just inside the
    boundary. One at about the 2:00 hour, one at 6:00 hour, and one at 10:00\. now
    draw lines to connect the 10:00 to the 2:00, 2:00 to the 6:00 and of course the
    6:00 to the 10:00, forming a triangle.

- en: 3) find a point as close to the middle of the triangle as you can. If there
    is a mark from the tent peg you used earlier, then you'll have an easy landmark.
    Draw straight lines connecting each corner of the triangle to that central point.
    It should now look like a triangle made up of triangles, or like a pyramid as
    if you were looking straight down at it from above.

    also lay seven or twelve stones in sun-wise (clockwise) order, placing each down
    with a spoken personal affirmation of protection. I tend to use twelve, with a 
    Go-to statement along these lines;'

    to the east/3:00 side of the circle. Reach down and smooth out/un-mark an area
    of the circle that is only wide enough for you to step through. If you placed
    stones, lift the one from the 3:00 position and keep it with you until you are
    ready to begin the intended working. This will be the key to your 'door'.

    about within the circle to act as a symbolic conductor of the energies you wish
    to draw up from below. You can also light incense, or use a singing bowl or chimes
    to represent the energy you wish to draw from above. Also, if this circle is being
    drawn as a part of a larger spell or ritual then this is when you would bring
    within any tools and offerings you plan to use to call your corners and otherwise
    do your working.

- en: 1) When it is time to use the circle and you have done all other preparations
    for your chosen intent, step to the 'door' to your circle and center yourself.
    A simple breathing exercise suffices. If you have a statement or affirmation you
    typically use to mark the beginning your magic rituals, you can do that now. If
    you laid stones, make sure you have the one you took with you when the circle
    was drawn. If you have a personal symbol of will that is not being included with
    the rest of your ritual like an athame, spear, sword, staff, or even just a sturdy
    stick, have that with you as well.

- en: 2) Step into the circle with confidence and full intent to use it for the task
    that it was built.  You have stepped into your magical space and have begun your
    working. Turn and draw closed the line of the circle so that it is once again
    complete. If you used stones in building the circle, place down the one you should
    have with you into the eastern gate. If you'd like, give a final affirmation.
    With the theme of laying them before, I state "The stone is Laid, the wall is
    built, the lock is sealed." as I set it down.

- en: 3) Stand at the center of the circle, over the focal point of the dragon's eye.
    Raise your arms to shoulder height, palms upwards or outwards, your symbol of
    will (if you are using one) in your dominant hand. Breathe in, visualize yourself
    in a place of strength, authority, and focused will. Breathe out that energy out
    into your circle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4)Repeat the mindful breath in. As you do, draw your hands together in front
    of you at chest height, elbows comfortably bent, repeating your visualization.
    Time the out-breath to once your hands meet. Release the second wave of energy
    into your circle to empower the first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5)Finally keep your hands together and raise them up slightly, to the height
    of your brow while breathing in. While breathing in, repeat the visualization
    of building energy within for a third time. Once the breath in is completed, without
    hesitation blow it out firmly in a huff and thrust your hands downward. If you
    have a symbol of will, insert it into the ground just inside your circle at he
    12:00/north position. Imagine the built energy following the gesture to fill the
    ground/floor of your circle and empower the drawn lines within, connecting them
    into a single continuous, unbroken line of light that glows upward and downward.
    Imagine that energy connecting to the flowing energy of the dragon-lines of the
    earth and the nebulous strands of the aurora in the sky. You may now use the circle.

- en: This is where I usually sit at the center and meditate to raise my vibration
    to the highest state I can reach, letting the energies all collect and feed each-other
    to resonate within the circle. After a short time I imagine myself a bridge, allowing
    the healing and supportive energy of the earth to flow up my body from the soles
    of my feet through to upwards from the top of my head, and simultaneously imagine
    the highest vibration I can reach of spirit energy running through me from the
    top of my head through downwards to flowing out of my feet into the ground. Basically
    I allow myself to become a pipe to let earth and spirit energy connect into and
    feed/balance and heal each-other. For me it is a very powerful experience and
    can make a sacred space absolutely humm. Done even semi-regularly it can change
    the subtle atmosphere of the whole place for an enduring time.

- en: When you are finished with your task, and any summoned spirits/guides/guardians/etc
    are dismissed and the magic working is fully concluded, simply touch your palm
    to the place you earlier thrust your hand (or take a hold of your symbol of will)
    and lift it gently from the spot. While lifting, mentally let go of the pent up
    energy and imagine it flowing away and fading like a morning mist. If you are
    keeping the circle in place for future use or to continue the working the next
    day/night, simply smooth out the eastern side of your circle and/or lift the stone
    at the 3:00 position and step out. Otherwise if you are finished with the space,
    clean up the site as you would any other circle by rubbing or washing out the
    circle and sigil.  All that is left is to continue on your way.
