    all magic and magical items except those magics and items that you or the other
    people you allow through allow.

    the energy flowing into a 'border' for your shield, chant, "Protect and Defend,
    so that family and friend only may enter and exit" The number doesn't really matter.
    Hold up both hands and imagine the border of energy being filled in with more
    energy. Seal it by saying, "It is done!" and making both hands into fists. The
    first time you or another person goes through it, you/they will feel a strange
    weight in your/their chest. That is the spell assessing the person and seeing
    if they are friend, family, foe, or the caster themselves.
