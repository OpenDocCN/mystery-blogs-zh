- en: This spell is not mine, it belongs to Fairy Truths on YouTube. It is a Roman
    spell to make you a fairy. She has tested it and it did work, however, magic is
    like the sea, unpredictable, so it may not work the first time.

    are submerged. Chime the chimes for approximately 10 seconds and lay them on a
    flat surface. Paint some of the potion, including your hair, on the chimes with
    a flower petal, keeping the chimes on a flat surface. The hair MUST stick to the
    chimes.

    10 seconds. Chime the chimes as you say the incantation three times. Set the chimes
    down and spread some of the potion on your forehead with a finger. Dispose of
    remaining potion and let what is on your forehead dry.
