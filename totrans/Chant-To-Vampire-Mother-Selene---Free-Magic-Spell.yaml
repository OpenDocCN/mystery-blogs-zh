- en: It is a fine chant, but I recommend using Google Translate if you do not speak
    Latin so you understand what you are saying, like I did, and I assume the author
    did too. I can see it as an invocation to the Moon Goddess Selene, and can be
    used in a ritual, but it will not turn you into a vampire, just call on her in
    worship.

    The ''headache paradox'' as they call it, can be explained simply. While your
    brain does not have nerves, the tissue surrounding it does. Pressure put on those
    nerves causes pain. Paradox explained. Vampires cannot possibly exist. Immortal?
    We are carbon based bodies. That cannot be changed. Carbon does in fact degrade,
    which is why we age. Please. Do explain how a human body could possibly become
    immortal and survive on the very few nutrients in blood?

- en: Dayday, the point of this site is to share information and experience. Sometimes
    that means using one's experience to explain a piece of information is misleading.
    Or even outright wrong. That is a part of sharing knowledge. Failing to correct
    a falsehood in the name of being nice achieves nothing but perpetuation of the
    error. That is a thing which does no one any good.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I understand the philosophical point you're trying to make, but we have pain
    receptors that send a signal to our brain when we are injured. We can be tricked
    into feeling pain or worse pain, depending on the circumstance, but if someone
    got stabbed, the pain receptors would send a signal saying ''we've been hurt,
    get out of this situation now'' [and yes, you have adrenaline which would dull
    the pain receptors for a time, but once the shock wore off, the pain would return]

    of the goddess that's why humanity believe that nothing can be done to be a vampire
    because of people who post on spell that it can't turn you like they are paid
    ads so ignore them and believe and your self and any spell will work

    No matter how fiercely you believe it. Jump, believing you will fly, and you will
    still find yourself landing on the ground in short order. Reality does not care
    whether you believe in it or not. It is still going to be real.

- en: This is coming from someone who has been within the vampiric communities for
    many years as a person of support and donation, who has had many discussions with
    many people. Who has worked with and for the energies and emotions involved. Who
    has done shadow work and healings, with one or two times where a person has left
    their vampiric nature behind. Or, at least, taken steps towards that goal;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, there are some things which can lead a person to awakening/discovering,
    or beginning to become vampiric. But the process does not lie in a spell, pact,
    or prayer. There is no light-switch to flip. And it does not present itself as
    beneficial or even distinctly supernatural/beyond what a normal person could achieve.
    Nor does it make a person stronger, long lived, unique, or special. It is an affliction
    of predispositions that creates difficulties in life. It does not remove them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the reality that exists, while the reality people want is completely
    different. That is why we collectively say that spells and prayers like this one
    are not real. Because they will not give you what you are looking for. That is
    assuming you have taken the time to consider what you actually want, and/or why
    you (the collective you) think you want what you believe being a 'vampire' could
    provide, to begin with.
