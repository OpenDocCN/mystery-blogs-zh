    so that you may work for me for a certain purpose. I adjure you by the undefiled
    name of the god DN, that if you pay no heed to me, and if I fail my operation,
    the earth which brought you forth will never be watered again as far as you are
    concerned. Mutabar nak barnakoka braeo menda laubraasse bendeo. Fulfil for me
    the perfect charm."'

    own name, whether your birth name or a magical name. Where it reads DN, speak
    the name of the Greek deity whose sphere is associated with the plant (Aphrodite
    for Venusian plants, Hermes for Mercurial plants, Kronos for Saturnian plants,
    Zeus for Jovial plants, Ares for Martial plants, Apollo for Solar plants, and
    Artemis for Lunar plants).

    rises from.

    inhibit the spell.

- en: Most plants are not under one single planet. If a plant you want is under more
    than one, use the name of the Greek deity whose sphere is most relevant to your
    intentions. For example, if it is under both Jupiter and Venus, use Aphrodite
    for love or Jupiter for wealth or fame.
