- en: One of the most curious phases of the Lunar cycle, a “waxing moon” (when the
    moon is getting fuller) is a great time to amplify the power of white magic and
    cast spells that wouldn’t have worked at any other time of the cycle. Today, we
    are going to teach you one of the most effective love spells out there – the **Waxing
    moon love spell**.

- en: As the spell is quite delicate, don’t be alarmed if it doesn’t work as intended
    the very first time you cast it. Spend some extra time meditating and healing
    your soul and try again – and you will likely find your powers have increased.

- en: If you want to increase the chances of the spell working, make sure you are
    performing it during the “waxing moon” phase, and not at any other time of the
    Lunar cycle. Although not dangerous as such when performed incorrectly, the spell
    will then pointlessly drain your energy and decrease the effectiveness of any
    other rituals you perform for up to three months. Plan wisely.

    the candle. Focus on the flame and medidate for as long as you feel is needed,
    focusing on the warm, fuzzy feeling in your lower abdomen and letting it grow
    and expand.
