- en: The Venus conjunct North Node aspect (which means you also have the Venus opposition
    South Node aspect) indicates a change in values concerning beauty and love. Your
    Venus sign may feel foreign to you but will have a significant influence on your
    life.
  prefs: []

- en: You probably have a lot of opportunities to attract relationships in your life.
    However, you’re like to fall into your South Node values in these relationships
    when you actually need to push towards your North Node. You’re unlike to find
    a good relationship or successfully develop your creativity until you develop
    some of your North Node’s qualities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus conjunct North Node aspect indicates that your values need to change
    in this lifetime. In the past, the things that you thought were “beautiful” might
    have been synthetic or false in some way. Now, you must find the beauty in what
    is natural and real.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These values also extend to relationships. With Venus conjunct North Node, this
    is a lifetime for you to learn how to coexist with others. In a past life or in
    childhood, you chose to do everything yourself with little care for harmony. Now
    is the time to develop your cooperative skills.
  prefs: []

- en: The Venus opposite South Node aspect can indicate that you did not see yourself
    as desirable or lovable, either in a past life or in childhood. To grow your soul,
    you must learn how to let yourself be seen this way. This involves being vulnerable
    with other people, something that may be difficult for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect also means that you need to seek out love interests with *different*
    values than you’ve previously dated. This might feel a bit uncomfortable (since
    you aren’t used to being around people with these values) but it is also necessary.
    Note that you won’t necessarily have many past lifetimes or a lot of karma with
    these love interests. Instead, you will be forging new bonds and learning new
    values together.
  prefs: []

    to put yourself out there and enter into romantic relationships. Through romantic
    hurts and through finding what you actually like, you will slowly develop the
    qualities of your North Node.

    This does *not* mean that the relationships are painless. In fact, you’ll probably

    these lessons – they will find *you*.
  prefs: []

- en: Within this lifetime, you should learn that your happiness does not depend on
    others. You were probably well-liked in the past and base much of your personality
    on what *others* think about you. Connection feels natural to you because you
    are charming and sociable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to charm others in order to be whole. You can exist, independent of others, and
    still be your most amazing self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may find that you spend too much time on relationships, especially in the
    younger years of your life. These relationships will cease to be fulfilling because
    the energy feels stagnant. Additionally, you meet many “karmic” partners, so many
    of your relationships have already played out in a past life, making this energy
    even more difficult.
  prefs: []

- en: In this lifetime with Venus opposition North Node, you’re here to learn about *yourself*.
    Relationships block you from self-knowledge, so you might need to take a step
    back until you really know who you are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably feel a sense of panic when others appear to abandon you. These
    feelings will be triggered over and over for you in relationships. This is a mechanism
    to help you grow. Your subconscious is telling you that it does not believe you
    can survive without others, does not think you are whole by yourself. Remember
    that this is *not true*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, you must learn to rely on *yourself*. Figure out what qualities you
    do have and learn to be there for yourself, to comfort yourself, and provide for
    yourself. It is only then that you will be able to love other people as equals
    instead of relying on them for love or status.
  prefs: []

    on others for love, status, recognition, and material things. This life is all
    about developing *independence* in these areas. By doing this, you will learn
    how to have deeper relationships on equal footing that actually feel much better
    to you.

    square North Node indicates that you want to avoid anything that makes you feel
    uncomfortable, preferring to focus on beautiful things or on romance. But until
    you confront those difficult things, you fall back into the same painful patterns
    over and over.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    others question the North Node qualities that you develop, you tend to believe
    them and ignore the lessons of your North Node again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Venus square North Node, you need to leave relationships behind that do
    not serve you. It’s important that you develop new relationships with different
    values. This path takes a *lot* of strength and is very uncomfortable, but remember
    that you’ll be uncomfortable either way because these Venusian relationships never
    feel completely *right*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Venus square North Node indicates that you don’t stick up for yourself
    in relationships. You may accept less than you deserve, stay with a cheating partner,
    etc. The way out is to focus on developing your North Node qualities (in the house
    of the North Node) to gain strength.
  prefs: []

    Perhaps you’re believing a fairytale that you can’t let go of. Or maybe you have
    taken on a victim mentality, or believe that you’re not worth as much (the value
    of Venus) as other people, that you deserve half a relationship. It’s time to
    confront those beliefs and put a spotlight on the lies you tell yourself.
  prefs: []

    logic in your relationships. You struggle to see the truth (and prefer to look
    at the beautiful story instead of the hard truth) so utilizing your logical mind
    is essential.

    find relationships that are much different from before. These relationships will *also*
    make you happier and feel more equal. Remember that the power is within you to
    choose differently!
