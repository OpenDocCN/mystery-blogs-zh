- en: Spend some time thinking about what your attitude is towards money before making
    this piece of magic. Do you tend to squander money recklessly? Or are you a skinflint
    with your money? If you do have problems with money, think about what your life
    would be like if all of your money problems were gone. And think about how much
    money you will need to comfortable financially.

  zh: 在进行这段魔法之前，花些时间思考你对金钱的态度。你是不是经常挥霍无度？还是对自己的钱非常吝啬？如果你确实有金钱问题，思考一下如果你所有的金钱问题都解决了，你的生活会变成什么样子。并且考虑一下你理财舒适所需的金额。

  zh: 把所有东西放在祭坛上，和有力量的幸运护身符和魔法道具放在一起，使你的魔法更加强大。最好用光亮的叶子和绿色布料装饰你的祭坛。
- en: Once per day drop a single coin into your dish. Then on the seventh day, take
    the candle, think about how having more money would create new opportunities for
    you, then visualize prosperity flowing it. Once you feel it is the right time,
    place your candle in the center of the altar, use your right hand to pick the
    dish up and then allow the coins to fall into your left hand.

  zh: 每天将一枚硬币放入你的碟子中。然后在第七天，拿起蜡烛，想象更多的钱会给你带来新的机会，然后将繁荣想象成流动。一旦你觉得是时候，把蜡烛放在祭坛的中心，用右手拿起碟子，让硬币落入左手。

- en: Get another coin out and place to the left of your first coin and say the incantation
    again. Keep doing this with each of your coins until there is a circle of coins
    around your candle. Once you have completed the circle, light your candle and
    visualize your seven coins giving your candle their power before it is sent into
    the atmosphere.

  zh: 拿出另一枚硬币，放在第一枚硬币的左边，再次说出咒语。继续这样做，直到你的每枚硬币都围绕着蜡烛形成一个圈。完成圈后，点燃你的蜡烛，并想象你的七枚硬币把它们的力量传递给蜡烛，然后发送到大气中。
- en: While the candle is burning, focus on the flame and reflect on your attitude
    towards money again, and how you can change it so that you are a more financially
    responsible individual. (If you already were this kind of person, you wouldn’t
    have to cast this spell!) Once the candle is burned out or it is time to extinguish
    it, put the coins back in the bowl. Put a coin inside your pocket each day, in
    addition to your loose change. Replace it with one or two coins from your change
    that is left over from the day before. Make sure to have seven coins at least
    in the bowl. If you do that, you will find yourself becoming a more financially
    wise individual and more opportunities for making money will start coming to you.
    It is completely up to you to recognize them, so once you do, make sure to seize
    your opportunities!

  zh: 蜡烛燃烧时，专注于火焰，再次反思你对金钱的态度，以及如何改变它，使自己成为更加理财负责的个体。（如果你已经是这样的人，你就不需要施展这个咒语了！）等到蜡烛燃尽或者是熄灭的时候，把硬币放回碗里。每天把一个硬币放进口袋里，加上你的零钱。用前一天剩下的零钱换回一两枚硬币，确保碗里至少有七枚硬币。如果你这样做，你会发现自己变得更加理财明智，而且会有更多赚钱的机会出现。完全取决于你是否能够认识到这些机会，所以一旦你认识到了，一定要抓住你的机会！
