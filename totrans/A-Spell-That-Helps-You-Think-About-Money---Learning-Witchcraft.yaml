- en: Spend some time thinking about what your attitude is towards money before making
    this piece of magic. Do you tend to squander money recklessly? Or are you a skinflint
    with your money? If you do have problems with money, think about what your life
    would be like if all of your money problems were gone. And think about how much
    money you will need to comfortable financially.

    your magic stronger. It is even better to decorate your altar with glossy leaves
    and a green cloth.

- en: Once per day drop a single coin into your dish. Then on the seventh day, take
    the candle, think about how having more money would create new opportunities for
    you, then visualize prosperity flowing it. Once you feel it is the right time,
    place your candle in the center of the altar, use your right hand to pick the
    dish up and then allow the coins to fall into your left hand.

- en: Get another coin out and place to the left of your first coin and say the incantation
    again. Keep doing this with each of your coins until there is a circle of coins
    around your candle. Once you have completed the circle, light your candle and
    visualize your seven coins giving your candle their power before it is sent into
    the atmosphere.

- en: While the candle is burning, focus on the flame and reflect on your attitude
    towards money again, and how you can change it so that you are a more financially
    responsible individual. (If you already were this kind of person, you wouldn’t
    have to cast this spell!) Once the candle is burned out or it is time to extinguish
    it, put the coins back in the bowl. Put a coin inside your pocket each day, in
    addition to your loose change. Replace it with one or two coins from your change
    that is left over from the day before. Make sure to have seven coins at least
    in the bowl. If you do that, you will find yourself becoming a more financially
    wise individual and more opportunities for making money will start coming to you.
    It is completely up to you to recognize them, so once you do, make sure to seize
    your opportunities!
