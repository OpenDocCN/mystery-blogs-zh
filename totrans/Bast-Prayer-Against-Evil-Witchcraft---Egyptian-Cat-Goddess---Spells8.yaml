- en: Bast, also known as Bastet, is an ancient Egyptian goddess with a complex and
    fascinating mythology. She is often depicted as a woman with the head of a domesticated
    cat, and was originally worshiped as a goddess of fertility and childbirth. Over
    time, her role expanded to include protection, music, dance, and joy.

- en: She symbolizes the joy of living as it is considered the deity of harmony and
    happiness. She was typically represented in the form of a domestic cat, or as
    a woman with the head of a cat, always carrying a sistrum (musical instrument)
    because she was especially pleased by humans dancing and playing music in her
    honor.

- en: The cult of Bast was so important that cats were raised in her temples to be
    her representation, and at the death of these, they were carefully mummified and
    buried in specific tombs for them.
