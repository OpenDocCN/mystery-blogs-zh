**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Danger or Calm Relaxed

Take your pecae sign symbol fingers and lay it under the object(s) that will be levitated. Feel that object's(s) energy. Imagine your finger melting into its surface. Remove your finger, now you just embraced it. Now, imagine it as a part of your body to use as an arm. Say:

''Feather's Weight,
I wish to feit.
Levitate Now,
I wish in how.''

Think hard that it firmly is a danger block...Imediatly quit thinking. Watch it levitate...

You cannot levitate objects with Real Magic, it is an illusion of stage magic.
