Chiron, also known as the Wounded Healer, is an extremely underrated and important asteroid in astrology. If you’re just beginning your journey with asteroids, I recommend starting with Chiron! Today, I’m diving right into Chiron in Aries.

We all have an inner wound that can be represented by our Chiron. Even though this wound can feel really painful, it can be transformed and used for good. We always have our Chiron signs for a good reason.

This transformation process is *really* important, otherwise we might feel that wound deep down for our whole lives without ever addressing it. No one feels good living with the negative effects Chiron forever!

Chiron is probably that thing that you just can’t ignore. Even though it’s really painful, the wound pops up over and over. This is why it’s so important to just deal with it, as painful as that might be at first.

## The Chiron in Aries Wound

The Chiron wound can come from a lot of different types of trauma, but the outcome is always similar in any specific sign. In Aries, the Chiron wound is all about a core **feeling of worthlessness**.

This is supposedly one of the most difficult yet important Chiron placements, although I tend to find that *all* Chiron placements are really painful. The reason that Aries can be so difficult is because it’s directly related to who you are as a person.

If you think of the typical Aries, you’ll notice that they are generally sure of themselves, confident, bold, and daring, which sometimes can even cause problems for them if these qualities become too extreme. Chiron in Aries is the *exact opposite* of the normal Aries.

Those with the placement of Chiron in Aries will often feel that they lack some sort of *core self* or that something is somehow wrong with them. They won’t feel sure of themselves or appear confident at all.

They may feel that they’re unfocused, uncentered, or that they just generally don’t belong. They may see everyone else in life moving along with a purpose but feel that they weren’t given one.

Above all, people with Chiron in Aries may feel that they don’t have the right to exist or that they are somehow a mistake.

The shame from this wound may make it very difficult to actually acknowledge it and begin to heal it, but this wound can also be extremely transformative as it heals.

After all, we’re all here for a reason, and the person with Chiron in Aries *always* has a very important purpose in the world!

## How This Wound Will Show Itself

There are two different ways that the Chiron in Aries wound can show itself. These methods of showcasing the wound are exact opposites, but they all stem from the same issue of not having a purpose or a sense of self that feels like it’s worth something.

**In the first scenario, the person may seek to please others and be intensely influenced by others.** They’re more like Libran people in nature, and will go out of their way (to the extreme detriment of themselves) to make others happy and get even the smallest bit of praise.

These Chiron in Aries folks aren’t feeding on this praise like a Leo would be, but instead *need* it to keep themselves together and to assure themselves that they have some type of purpose on earth. They probably feel that if they can at least make other people happy then they have some worth.

The individual will basically dedicate themselves to making others happy, but it will be at the expense of themselves.

They will also struggle when in a group and different people want different things from them. They will choose the person who can offer the biggest reward (the person who’s praise means the most) and can be unintentionally cliquey because of this.

Generally, these people try to avoid taking any type of stand or getting involved in conflict or confrontation. They’ll usually choose careers or lifestyle paths where little opinion is required of them.

They might also try to rescue others who lack self-worth; they’re pretty good at recognizing these same character traits in others.

This person is simply trying to prove that they can fit in with the crowd and therefore are not wrong or a mistake. The first step is for this individual to realize that trying to please others doesn’t bring them any lasting satisfaction, and that they were never a mistake in the first place, even if they may *feel* wrong inside.

These Chiron in Aries folks have a really hard time standing up for themselves, even when they know they should. The fear of “reopening” the wound keeps them from taking a stand.

They can also self-sabotage at times. They might almost intentionally (even though it feels unintentional to them) sabotage a relationship, a career, or anything else. They’re basically proving to themselves that they *don’t* have any worth, but this is because of the wound: this is just a false belief.

These Chiron in Aries folks almost feel like they don’t have a *right* to ask for what they need or even a right to exist. They feel like their very being is *wrong.*

Most people don’t recognize the Chiron in Aries placement when the wound expresses itself this way because these qualities are all opposite from typical Aries qualities. This individual is suppressing all Aries qualities in order to try and find a way to make the wound less painful.

I do find that people with Chiron in Aries might have a lot of underlying rage. This is typically the person who *appears* passive, sweet, and malleable, but underneath they’re just seething with frustration and anger that they have to hide.

**Alternatively, the person might turn aggressive, showy, inflexible, and even selfish.** This individual *still* feels just as unworthy because of the Chiron in Aries wound, but they have the opposite reaction: they focus completely on themselves to try and “fix” the wound.

These Chiron in Aries people also feel like their very existence is wrong or that something is wrong with their soul, so they try to get attention to *prove* to themselves that it isn’t true. The problem is that they get all the wrong types of attention, so they never really prove anything to themselves.

They may be extremely sensitive to any putdown (whether or not the other person really intended to judge them) and can react extremely aggressively. These folks can have a lot of mood swings.

This is the guy in the bar who flips out at the smallest slight or the person who will never speak to you again after an insignificant fight. While we see this as difficult when we encounter it in another person, what’s *really* hard is the emotions that the other is experiencing.

Any small slight makes Chiron in Aries feel incredibly useless and will remind them of how deep down they will always lack a true self and a purpose. In order to *try* to make themselves feel better, they will snap, but it doesn’t fix the true issue.

The reason that the person will react this way is in an attempt to prove their uniqueness and worthiness to exist, but even if they can prove it through an interaction, it doesn’t convince them on the inside.

This wound can manifest in two completely separate ways, but the point is that the Chiron in Aries person is always trying to *prove* to themselves that they *are* worth it and *should* exist. Unfortunately, neither method convinces them that it’s true.

Lastly, because Aries can be so physical and extreme, this wound will sometimes manifest as extreme addictions to things (alcohol, drugs, working out, extreme sports, etc.).

The Aries in Chiron person can be pretty hardcore when they’re trying to “get rid of” the bad feelings that come with the wound, but how exactly this happens will depend on the house and aspects to Chiron.

## Where Does the Wound Come From?

If you have a Chiron in Aries wound, this means that in the past (whether in a past life or childhood) your individuality was stifled. During a series of interactions, you were taught that your individual beliefs, needs, wants, etc. were bad, and that it was wrong to have them.

You basically learned that individuality is bad and that there’s something wrong with *your* beliefs specifically. You learned that you didn’t have the right to be yourself unapologetically.

I find that this wound can often show up after someone has had a lot of *group* interactions. For example, maybe you were part of a big family and had to go along with all family decisions, or you were raised at a school with militant rules and you didn’t have a say over anything.

Sometimes, this Chiron in Aries wound has to do with the parents. I find that some parents made the child feel as thought he/she had unique qualities that were *bad*, qualities that had to be stifled.

This happened a lot in time periods when children had to be seen and not heard or when gender roles were strictly enforced.

Sometimes Chiron in Aries comes from childhood, sometimes it shows up from a past life, and sometimes it’s a combination of both.

## How to Heal Chiron in Aries

None of us are meant to be doormats, but we’re also not meant to attack others. Neither of these two reactions will make the Chiron in Aries individual feel good for the long haul or fix the struggle going on inside of them.

The difficulty with healing these wounds is that the Chiron in Aries person is very resilient and tends to avoid talking about pain. They would rather keep forging forward, but what Chiron in Aries needs to realize is that sometimes, backwards *is* forwards.

The first step is for the Chiron in Aries person to confront the fact that he/she does not feel a sense of self. The person may feel that there’s something wrong with him, or that something about her is useless or destructive. This is *really* painful, but it has to be faced on to work through this wound.

They then need to realize that a false belief is the problem. They have some belief about themselves that *isn’t true, *because they absolutely do deserve to be here and are here for a reason.

Chiron in Aries needs to make an impact on the world, but they have to find their unique purpose. It most likely will not be something that easily blends in with the crowd, but it will be extremely important to the growth of mankind.

Note that while working on Chiron’s wounds, you may feel a good deal of suppressed anger, especially in a fire sign such as Aries. This is completely normal – do you best to express it in a non-destructive, healthy way, such as journaling, seeing a therapist, etc.

Chiron’s wounds will never completely heal, but they can be addressed and transmuted to create something wonderful. If you have the Chiron in Aries placement, you will learn that it is through your wounds (and the process of dealing with them) that you will find your unique purpose and start to feel like you exist for a specific reason.

Chiron in Aries will often become quite the healer (whether physically, mentally, emotionally, or metaphorically) because they’re able to recognize when others feel a lack of self-worth, due to having experienced it themselves. They can be extremely kind and caring towards others once they can deal with their own pain instead of completely identifying with it.

If you’re feeling lost about where to begin, try the following exercise.

### Chiron in Aries Exercise

1.  Make a list of qualities you consider to be positive and a list of qualities you consider to be negative. If you’re having trouble, Google *personality traits* or *positive and negative qualities* and use that as a starting point.
2.  Put a check mark next to the qualities you believe you possess. Put a circle next to the qualities you would like to develop.
3.  Observe yourself displaying both the positive and negative qualities over the next few weeks. Notice especially when you display a positive quality, and when you bring value to an interaction with someone or something else.
