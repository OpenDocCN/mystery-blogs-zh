    (or any other way of wearing them) then grab the sage and burn the leaves enough
    to make sure they keep smoking for a while....(then while speaking the incantation
    below) slowly keep moving the smoking sage trough the air in circular motions.

- en: You can use cleansing herbs like sage smoke to cleanse your home while calling
    on Dragons for further assistance, but the ''chant'' is just gibberish. Write
    your own chant calling on Dragons and this will work.

- en: Be careful with sage. White sage, especially sage smudging, is exclusive to
    indigenous culture and should not be used by non-natives. And being 1/18 Cherokee
    princess does not count. There are other cleansing herbs and bundles you can use,
    but sage smudge is different from a smoke cleanse. As for the chant, it is fake.
    As Neko suggested above, find a chant that works for you and use that. Heck, you
    could omit this entire spell, bless your lemon scented floor cleaner, and chant
    as you are washing your floors. It might surprise some, but that can count as
    a cleansing too. Not as potent, but good for washing away your daily negative
    gunk.
