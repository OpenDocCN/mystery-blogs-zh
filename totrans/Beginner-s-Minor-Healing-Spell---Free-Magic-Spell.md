**You will need the following items for this spell:**

 1\. Sit down outside or in your porch. If you don't have a porch, a balcony works as well. Meditate for a few seconds and charge your pen/highlighter. To charge it, simply imagine white light inside you flowing into the pen/highlighter.

2\. Draw a sigil involving what you want to heal.A good sigil making site is Sigil Scribe. Maybe you want to heal an injury, than it should be something like "I want to heal the injury on my(wherever the injury is)". For me, I did something like "Make my sneezes go away". Than, draw a corresponding sigil on your palm with the charged pen/highlighter.

3\. Say:

"Oh Moon's Silver Ray, make my (whatever you want to heal) go away"

4\. Say two more times before saying something like "By the power of three so mote it be" or something.

5\. While you say the spell, be sure to visualize yourself healed.
