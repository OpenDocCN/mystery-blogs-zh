    what type of Witch I am. Or you may still be fuzzy. If you’re not sure, that’s
    perfectly ok. The outset of this quiz is just a small part of your magical journey.

- en: Remember, you were able to take the “What Type of Witch Are you” quiz in the
    privacy of your home without curious eyes. So relax and try not to make things
    more complex than they need be. There is really no such thing as cookie-cutter
    Witchcraft. We, like a room full of black cats, are all too stubbornly individualistic
    for that!

- en: If you find yourself stewing in this uncertain cauldron, perhaps take a peek
    at some of the other Witch’s listed and see if they fit you better. A common mistake
    made when people get excited about something is marrying themselves to the first
    thing they find. Witchcraft practices shouldn’t be like that. You are exploring
    what kind of Witch are you. Take your time. You will know for sure over time and
    it will be clear as a bell, book and candle!

    answered the question “what type of Witch are you” it wouldn’t hurt to meditate
    on that awareness for a while. Let it gently settle into your spirit. Affirm your
    choice out loud, if you wish. Speech and hearing are two senses that transform
    the energy in our aura, aiding in manifestation. Think of this like trying on
    a new pair of new ruby slippers. Sometimes you need to walk a few steps before
    finding that comfort zone.

    for your spells and rituals. You don’t have to do this all at once (hey, we all
    have a budget), and obviously, the items change depending on the type of Witch
    the quiz revealed. Also, remember that a lot of a Witch’s tools can often be found
    in and around the home, like herbs and spices in your pantry. There is absolutely
    nothing wrong with using those items. If anything they already resonate with your
    personal energy making them even more effective.

    you can multitask – do some networking too. Mix, mingle, talk to people. Ask questions.
    Reach out and see if you can find others that are the same type of Witch you are,
    or those who simply enjoy the company of other people of a like mind.

- en: Egads! Just because you decide you are a Solitary Witch doesn’t mean you can’t
    hang with a Kitchen Witch periodically. Take off your pointy hat and start out
    simple. If anything you’ll find surprising commonalities and probably get some
    grand ideas through the exchange (and perhaps make a long-term friend in the process).

- en: Now there is the process of figuratively “bagging it up” and taking home all
    the wonderful goodies you’ve discovered. As you take each new magical piece out,
    determine where it should live in your sacred space of home. Perhaps you want
    to set up an altar specifically for your tools. Perhaps you want them scattered
    about as decorative touches that make you smile wherever you look. Trust your
    instincts in terms of fitting together everything like an energetic puzzle. You
    will probably rearrange them several times anyway before you’re happy.

- en: Finally, it’s always good to keep a magical journal that follows your exploration
    and growth in Witchcraft. You can keep this separate or add it to your Witch’s
    spell book (or Grimoire) when you create one. Go back and read this from time
    to time just to see if you get even more insights out of your experiences. Page
    by page you can literally witness personal improvements and celebrate them. Where
    there’s a Witch there’s a way.****
