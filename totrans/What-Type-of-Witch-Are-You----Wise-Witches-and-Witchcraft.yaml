    what type of Witch I am. Or you may still be fuzzy. If you’re not sure, that’s
    perfectly ok. The outset of this quiz is just a small part of your magical journey.

    privacy of your home without curious eyes. So relax and try not to make things
    more complex than they need be. There is really no such thing as cookie-cutter
    Witchcraft. We, like a room full of black cats, are all too stubbornly individualistic
    for that!

    at some of the other Witch’s listed and see if they fit you better. A common mistake
    made when people get excited about something is marrying themselves to the first
    thing they find. Witchcraft practices shouldn’t be like that. You are exploring
    what kind of Witch are you. Take your time. You will know for sure over time and
    it will be clear as a bell, book and candle!

  zh: 如果你发现自己在这种不确定的坩埚中煨熟，也许看看其他列出的女巫类型，看看它们是否更适合你。人们在对某事感到兴奋时常犯的一个错误是与他们找到的第一件事情结合在一起。女巫的实践不应该是这样的。你正在探索自己是什么类型的女巫。慢慢来。随着时间的推移，你会确定，并且会清晰如钟，书和蜡烛！
- en: On the other hand should your wand light up merrily and you feel you have absolutely
    answered the question “what type of Witch are you” it wouldn’t hurt to meditate
    on that awareness for a while. Let it gently settle into your spirit. Affirm your
    choice out loud, if you wish. Speech and hearing are two senses that transform
    the energy in our aura, aiding in manifestation. Think of this like trying on
    a new pair of new ruby slippers. Sometimes you need to walk a few steps before
    finding that comfort zone.

  zh: 另一方面，如果你的魔杖亮起来，你觉得你绝对回答了问题“你是什么类型的女巫”，那么花点时间沉思这种意识也不会有什么坏处。让它慢慢地融入你的精神中。如果愿意，大声肯定你的选择。言语和听觉是我们气场中能量转化的两种感觉，有助于实现。把它想象成试穿一双新红宝石拖鞋。有时候你需要走几步才能找到那种舒适区。
- en: What next? Well, gather up your broomstick and other tools that you’ll need
    for your spells and rituals. You don’t have to do this all at once (hey, we all
    have a budget), and obviously, the items change depending on the type of Witch
    the quiz revealed. Also, remember that a lot of a Witch’s tools can often be found
    in and around the home, like herbs and spices in your pantry. There is absolutely
    nothing wrong with using those items. If anything they already resonate with your
    personal energy making them even more effective.

  zh: 接下来呢？好吧，收集起你的扫帚和其他你施法和仪式所需的工具。你不必一次做完这一切（嘿，我们都有预算），显然，物品会根据测验显示的女巫类型而改变。还要记住，女巫的许多工具通常可以在家里找到，比如你的厨房里的草药和香料。使用这些物品绝对没有错。如果有的话，它们已经与你的个人能量共鸣，使它们更加有效。
- en: While you are wandering around in New Age and Witchy shops for your gadgets
    you can multitask – do some networking too. Mix, mingle, talk to people. Ask questions.
    Reach out and see if you can find others that are the same type of Witch you are,
    or those who simply enjoy the company of other people of a like mind.

  zh: 当你在新时代和女巫商店里逛逛找你的小工具时，你可以同时做多任务 - 也可以进行一些社交。交际，交际，和人们交谈。提出问题。伸出手，看看是否能找到与你相同类型的女巫，或者那些简单地喜欢与思想相似的人在一起的人。
- en: Egads! Just because you decide you are a Solitary Witch doesn’t mean you can’t
    hang with a Kitchen Witch periodically. Take off your pointy hat and start out
    simple. If anything you’ll find surprising commonalities and probably get some
    grand ideas through the exchange (and perhaps make a long-term friend in the process).

  zh: 天哪！只是因为你决定成为一个独行女巫并不意味着你不能偶尔与厨房女巫一起玩耍。摘下你的尖帽，从简单的开始。如果有的话，你会发现令人惊讶的共同点，并可能通过交流得到一些伟大的想法（也许在这个过程中结交一个长期的朋友）。
- en: Now there is the process of figuratively “bagging it up” and taking home all
    the wonderful goodies you’ve discovered. As you take each new magical piece out,
    determine where it should live in your sacred space of home. Perhaps you want
    to set up an altar specifically for your tools. Perhaps you want them scattered
    about as decorative touches that make you smile wherever you look. Trust your
    instincts in terms of fitting together everything like an energetic puzzle. You
    will probably rearrange them several times anyway before you’re happy.

  zh: 现在是象征性地“打包”并带回家你发现的所有美好物品的过程。当你拿出每个新的魔法物件时，确定它应该放在你家的神圣空间中的位置。也许你想为你的工具专门设置一个祭坛。也许你想把它们散布在各处，作为让你无论看到哪里都会微笑的装饰品。相信你的直觉，将一切像一个能量拼图一样拼凑在一起。在你满意之前，你可能会重新安排它们几次。
- en: Finally, it’s always good to keep a magical journal that follows your exploration
    and growth in Witchcraft. You can keep this separate or add it to your Witch’s
    spell book (or Grimoire) when you create one. Go back and read this from time
    to time just to see if you get even more insights out of your experiences. Page
    by page you can literally witness personal improvements and celebrate them. Where
    there’s a Witch there’s a way.****

  zh: 最后，始终保持一个神奇的日志，记录你在巫术中的探索和成长是一件好事。你可以将其单独保存，或者在创建巫术法术书（或魔法书）时将其添加进去。不时地回顾这些记录，看看是否能从中获得更多的见解。逐页地，你可以真切地见证个人的进步并加以庆祝。哪里有巫师，哪里就有一条路。
