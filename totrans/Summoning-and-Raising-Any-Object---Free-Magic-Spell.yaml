- en: If you have the paper and pencil, write the name of your object and if you want
    a rough sketch of what it will look like. (You can start from here if you don't
    have the pencil and paper.) Close your eyes and imagine what your object looks
    like. Then, chant, 'By the power resting within me, take thee, and put it into
    thy life." Chant that twice.

    and you will barely be able to see it. Sort of like a ghost. Feed it with summoned
    food and give it water. After about two days of this, it should feed itself in
    (if you have made one) your dimension, if you tell it to go to your dimension,
    or go to it's own. You may also see it randomly. If you do, get away from people
    with an excuse or something and take care of what it needs.
