    out of yourself, and take a look around with new eyes! See the world as a place
    where you belong, a place full of opportunities.

    your eyes open for opportunities. Be thankful for even the smallest gift you might
    receive.

- en: On a weekly basis, as you water the plant, repeat the incantation to yourself.
    Take this time to make sure the plant is healthy and give it any extra care it
    needs. If your plant dies, don't worry or take it as a bad omen! It's possible
    the plant has absorbed a lot of negativity, so you should re-do the ritual with
    a new plant, which more than likely will do better.

    one and is working so far. best of luck and remember if you use a tree, it is
    also a representation of the tree of life. http://www.wejees.net/moneytree.html
