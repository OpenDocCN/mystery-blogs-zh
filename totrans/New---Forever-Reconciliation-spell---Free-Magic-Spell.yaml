  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That depends on how you define the term, which varies quite broadly depending
    on traditions followed and personal opinion. Some hold that white magic is anything
    desiring a positive ends, and anything desiring harm to the target would be considered
    black magic. Some hold that manipulating free will falls under black magic. Some
    believe doing any sort of magic regarding another person without their direct
    knowledge and consent is black magic. Some traditions hold strictly that only
    workings focused on the inner self are so-called white magic, while anything desiring
    an external result should be avoided. Some further their insistence by explaining
    any desired external positive effects will come by internal progress and betterment
    as a person.

- en: To add to prsona's comment, Magik is intention, not colour. Some witches categorize
    spells by colour, but Magik is neutral and it is the spellcaster that gives the
    positive or negative charge. I highly recommend you create a code of ethics before
    casting spells. Unless you follow a religion such as Wicca, a lot of The Craft
    is personal. As yourself what is and is not morally justified in your opinion.
    Once you have a code of ethics, it will be easier for you to determine what spells
    you feel you should and should not cast. In Wicca, we have The Rede, which states
    harm none. On paper, great, in practice, not so much. Hitting someone is harmful,
    and most people would agree it is wrong. What about in self defense? How about
    gossiping or name calling? The person is physically fine, but are hurt mentally
    and emotionally. Once you you understand what mundane issues you feel are right
    and wrong, think about Magikally. Reading over this spell, you are saying you
    are ready to make amends, but the other person is not involved, therefore you
    are making a choice for them to get back together. Would you consider this right
    or wrong based on your morals? That is your answer.
