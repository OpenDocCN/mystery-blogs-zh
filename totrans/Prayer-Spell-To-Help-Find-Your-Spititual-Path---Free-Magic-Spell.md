''By the Powers that be,
Lead me to my path, make it clear to see,
On this spititual journey i am about to embark,
Guide me through the dark,
In my mind's eye, as clear as day,
I can see my path, Divinity has shown me the way.
Regardless of which road i take, i will always walk hand-in-hand with Divinity,
This is my will, So Mote It Be.''

How will I know my path afterwards?

I don't think this will help much if you aren't researching, meditating, soul searching, journaling, and trying to connect with your inner self to find your path. You don't need to pick a label right away, your path can grow and change over time, so don't worry if something doesn't 100% fit you right away. Just keep going, you'll find what speaks to you.
