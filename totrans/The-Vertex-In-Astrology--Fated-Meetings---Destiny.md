> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/the-vertex-in-astrology/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/the-vertex-in-astrology/#0001-01-01)

Vertex in astrology is a significant point in a person’s natal chart. It is also known as the “third angle” and is calculated based on the intersection of the ecliptic and the prime vertical. The vertex is not a planet, but rather a point that represents a certain kind of energy in a person’s life.

**In astrology, the vertex is said to represent fated events and encounters.** It is believed to bring people and situations into a person’s life that are meant to help them grow and evolve spiritually. The vertex is also associated with relationships and is said to indicate the kind of partner a person is destined to meet. Astrologers believe that the vertex can reveal important information about a person’s life path and purpose.

## Understanding Vertex in Astrology

The Vertex is a sensitive point in the natal chart that represents fated encounters and important relationships. It is not a planet, but [similar to Part of Fortune](https://teaandrosemary.com/part-of-fortune-astrology/), is rather a mathematical point that is derived from the intersection of the ecliptic (the path of the Sun) and the prime vertical (the plane that runs from due east to due west).

The Vertex is also known as the “electric axis” because it is believed to be a point of high energy and intensity. It is associated with sudden and unexpected events, as well as with people who come into our lives for a specific purpose. When it’s activated, you’ll *know, *and Vertex is fated so you must simply see the lessons out to the end.

The Anti-Vertex, on the other hand, is the point directly opposite the Vertex.

In terms of interpretation, the sign and house placement of the Vertex can provide insight into the types of people and experiences that are likely to have a significant impact on an individual’s life. For example, if the Vertex is in Aries, the person may have fated encounters with assertive and independent individuals, while if the Vertex is in the 7th house, the person may have important relationships that involve partnership and cooperation.

It is also important to consider the aspects that the Vertex makes to other planets and points in the chart, as these can provide additional information about the nature of the fated encounters and relationships that the Vertex represents. For example, a Vertex that is closely conjunct the Sun may indicate a powerful and transformative encounter with a male figure, while a Vertex that is square to Saturn may suggest fated challenges and obstacles in important relationships.

Overall, the Vertex is a valuable tool for understanding the fated encounters and relationships that shape our lives. While it is not as well-known as some of the other points in the chart, it can provide valuable insights that can help individuals navigate their personal and professional relationships with greater awareness and understanding.

## Interpreting Vertex Aspects

Here are some key points to keep in mind when interpreting Vertex aspects:

*   The Vertex is often associated with fated or destined events and relationships.
*   Vertex aspects can indicate important people or events that will come into a person’s life, or that have already had a significant impact.
*   The sign and house placement of the Vertex can give clues as to the nature of the fated event or relationship.
*   Aspects to the Vertex from other planets can provide further insight into the nature of the event or relationship, as well as the timing.

It is important to note that Vertex aspects should not be interpreted in isolation. They should be considered in the context of the entire horoscope, including other aspects and planetary placements.

For example, a person with a Vertex conjunct their Sun may experience a fated event or relationship that is strongly tied to their sense of self and identity. However, this interpretation may be modified by other factors in the chart, such as the sign and house placement of the Sun, and any other aspects to the Sun or Vertex.

Overall, interpreting Vertex aspects requires careful consideration of the entire horoscope, as well as an understanding of the symbolic meaning of the Vertex point itself.

## Vertex in Astrology: Synastry

When it comes to synastry, the Vertex in astrology is a point that represents fateful encounters and significant relationships. It is believed that the Vertex is connected to the spiritual aspects of our lives and can indicate the kind of people we are meant to meet and the lessons we are meant to learn from them.

Vertex in strology is *most* often used in synastry. It’s easiest to see how Vertex plays out in the synastry chart compared to the natal/other charts.

**In a synastry chart, the Vertex is often compared to the North and South Nodes.** While the Nodes represent our karmic past and future, the Vertex represents the people and experiences that will help us fulfill our destiny.

When the Vertex of one person is conjunct the personal planets of another (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, or Mars), it is believed to indicate a fated and significant relationship. The Vertex can also form conjunctions with the Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven, and IC, which can indicate a powerful connection between two people.

This *doesn’t *mean that the two people will fall immediately in love. Vertex is simply fate, regardless of your personal feelings about it. The Vertex represents those situations you just *can’t* get away from because they feel too big and important.

However, it is important to note that the Vertex is just one factor in a synastry chart and should not be relied on solely to determine the fate of a relationship. It is also important to consider other planetary aspects and placements in the chart.

### Vertex on the angles/nodes in synastry

I always look to angles and nodes first in synastry. Vertex/nodal

**North Node:** North Node contacts with Vertex in astrology synastry indicate that the planet/point person is essential to the spiritual growth of the Vertex person, while for the North Node person, contacts can significantly alter their life direction. The North Node person has a soul contract with the Vertex person, and both will learn lessons from their meeting. The Vertex person may feel a karmic connection and stick with the North Node person until they fulfill their mission. The initial meeting may feel mysterious and serious, with a sense of recognition. The lessons learned will depend on the houses and planetary contacts involved.

**South Node:** This is a difficult placement. The South Node person may feel heavy and drag down the Vertex person, and the interaction may feel familiar and intense. The aim is to complete the unfinished business and move on, which may involve the South Node person turning the Vertex person’s world upside down or being an irritation that needs to be evicted. 

**Ascendant and Descendant:** When the Vertex and Ascendant/Descendant have a connection with Vertex in synastry, it often indicates a fated meeting. The Ascendant/Descendant person may stand out to the Vertex person instantly, though this isn’t always romantic. This could even be an enemy placement as well as friends *or* romantic. The Vertex person will hel the AC/DC person to see their shadow, leading to a lesson of acceptance and integration. The aim is to develop mutual understanding, regardless of initial feelings, so it’s best not to remain at odds forever.

**For the MC and IC:** Here, the Vertex attracts parental figures and life guides. If the Vertex is on the IC, the IC person may act as a guide, while the MC person may nurture the Vertex if the Vertex is conjunct the MC. The IC/MC person can feel like home to the Vertex. Living with the Vertex on the IC and working together with the Vertex on the MC can teach valuable life lessons.

### Vertex aspecting the planets in synastry

**The Sun:** The Sun represents one’s core identity, ego, and life path. When the Vertex aligns with the Sun in synastry, it signifies a relationship that has a profound impact on each person’s sense of self and life direction. This alignment suggests that the individuals are drawn together for a purposeful reason, often involving personal growth and shared experiences. The Vertex in astrology on the Sun in synastry often points to a relationship where both individuals inspire and challenge each other to become the best versions of themselves. There may be a strong sense of mutual respect and admiration, as well as a feeling that the relationship is guiding them toward important life lessons. The connection may involve collaborative efforts, shared goals, and a sense of partnership that contributes to each person’s individual journey. The individuals may learn valuable insights about their own strengths, identity, and life purpose through their interactions with each other.

**The Moon:** The Moon represents emotions, instincts, and the subconscious. When the Vertex aligns with the Moon in synastry, it indicates a relationship where emotional understanding, empathy, and a sense of comfort play a significant role. This alignment suggests that the individuals have a strong potential to connect on an emotional level and understand each other’s innermost feelings. The Vertex on the Moon in synastry often points to a relationship that provides emotional security, support, and a sense of belonging. Both individuals may feel a deep sense of resonance and familiarity with each other, as if they have known each other for a long time. The connection may involve sharing personal stories, opening up about vulnerabilities, and creating a safe space for each other’s emotions. The individuals may also have a strong influence on each other’s moods and emotional well-being.

The individuals may inspire each other’s ideas, challenge each other’s perspectives, and contribute to each other’s learning experiences. The relationship can also provide a platform for effective problem-solving and mutual understanding.

The relationship may also involve a strong sense of giving and receiving love, as well as a desire to create a harmonious and supportive partnership.

When the Vertex aligns with Mars in synastry, it indicates that the relationship is likely to be active, assertive, and potentially filled with intense emotions. The presence of Mars can bring a sense of drive, ambition, and competitiveness to the connection. The Vertex on Mars in synastry often points to a relationship where both individuals are drawn together by shared goals, projects, or activities that require teamwork and collaboration. This alignment can lead to a sense of mutual motivation and a desire to work together to achieve common objectives. However, because Mars is a planet that can also bring conflict and challenges, the Vertex-Mars alignment can also indicate the potential for disagreements, power struggles, and clashes of will. It’s important for both individuals to navigate these dynamics with open communication, compromise, and a willingness to find common ground.

**Jupiter:** Jupiter is known as the planet of expansion, luck, and higher knowledge.

The presence of Saturn can bring a sense of duty and seriousness to the connection, leading to a strong sense of mutual responsibility and accountability.

**Uranus:** Uranus is associated with change, individuality, originality, and unconventional thinking. When the Vertex aligns with Uranus in synastry, it signifies a bond that brings excitement, change, and a sense of awakening to both individuals. The presence of Uranus can introduce an element of surprise and new experiences into the relationship. The Vertex on Uranus in synastry often points to a relationship that is unconventional and may challenge societal norms or expectations. Both individuals may inspire each other to embrace their authentic selves and explore uncharted territory.

The individuals may encourage each other to think outside the box, take risks, and pursue innovative ideas.

**Neptune:** Neptune is associated with spirituality, imagination, dreams, and the subconscious. When the Vertex aligns with Neptune in synastry, it signifies a relationship that is ethereal, intuitive, and often carries a sense of destiny. The presence of Neptune can bring a heightened sensitivity and a desire to explore the deeper realms of the connection. The Vertex in astrology on Neptune in synastry often points to a relationship that goes beyond the material world and involves a strong emotional and spiritual connection. Both individuals may feel a sense of spiritual resonance and may be drawn to explore metaphysical or creative pursuits together. The connection may involve a strong sense of compassion, empathy, and a desire to support each other’s emotional well-being. The individuals may inspire each other’s artistic expression, imagination, and ability to connect with the unseen.

**Pluto:** Pluto is associated with transformation, power, regeneration, and the subconscious.
