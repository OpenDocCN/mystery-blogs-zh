    the use of onion sprouts. Inscribe the person‚Äôs name on it and leave it on the
    altar. If the onion grows fast, then this it is a sign of improvement, health
    and happiness. In the past, young women also used this technique to find out who
    would become their long-term love partner.'

    in the near future.'
