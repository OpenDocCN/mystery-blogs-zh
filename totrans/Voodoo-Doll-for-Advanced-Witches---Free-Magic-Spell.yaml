- en: A highly effective voodoo doll with a cloaking spell in it to ensure the victim
    is unaware of their manipulation. It should BE NOTED that this spell can be used
    for physical harm but works more effectively for spiritual and mental manipulation.

- en: Make the doll by cutting the cloth into the shape of a humanoid figure. Not
    too small or you wont be able to fit your ingredients into it. Make it approximately
    6inches tall by 3 inches wide. Make sure to make the arms thick enough to put
    your filling into it. The bigger the doll, the easier it will be to channel energy
    into your pins and doll. When you've sewn the doll, start to fill it up with your
    filling material. When you are half full, start putting targets personal items
    into it.

- en: NOTE; If you are making a HEALING DOLL use crystals and other healing herbs
    inside the doll. If you are making a HEX DOLL with intent of PHYSICAL HARM or
    DEATH, add items such as animal bones(or human if you can get your hands on them),
    dead bird's feathers, dead animals blood(put it in a WELL SEALED container in
    the doll for disease and health safety). For Ill intent dolls, the more personal
    items you put in, the better. NOTE END.
  prefs: []

- en: Finish filling the doll after all items have been added. When finished, sew
    the opening and begin to mediate on the dolls purpose. Be specific and if it helps,
    say your intentions out loud.

- en: NOTE; If the doll is being preformed on another witch and/or they are capable
    of being aware of being manipulated through magickal purposes, make a binding
    knot magick string to mask and cloak the doll. Make sure it is powerful, your
    doll is going to be strong, the cloak needs to be stronger. NOTE END.

    image for healing] As mentioned in the spell, stuffing the doll with the person
    hair, skin, nails, spit, blood, will personalize it, while the items you choose
    to stuff it with will charge the doll with the specific energy you require [healing,
    love, cursing, luck, protection]

- en: Is there a specific type of manipulation? If it's love for example you would
    combine herbs with love [barley, basil, rose] with baneful herbs [chicory, guinea
    pepper, Jezebel root] and personal items from the target [hair, nails, spit] then
    enchant the doll while focusing on your desired outcome. If you choose to stab
    the doll with pins, charge each pin with your anger, visualize the person's sudden
    misfortune, then stab the doll [again, where specifically depends on what the
    doll is intended for. Love in the heart, if you want them to feel pain you could
    stab them all over, if it's money, stab their side where their wallet would be]

- en: This is a basic outline on making a Voodoo doll, however, if you do not practice
    Hoodoo/Voodoo/Vodou do not attempt this because it is a closed practice and you
    could anger the spirits. Research poppets if you wish to make dolls in anothers
    likeness for spell work.
