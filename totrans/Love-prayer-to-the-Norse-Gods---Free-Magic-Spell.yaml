    and make the effort to get to know me on a more serious note. I know she has social
    anxiety/is scared to open up .. and she is not in a proper mental/emotional state
    now.. but she has the opportunity to come visit me, but instead she is still determined
    to go to Qatar. Please send her to me instead üôèüèª

- en: If you do not work with Freya, I would not call on her. Especially if you do
    not have an offering. Also, this is very broad. You do not say their name or have
    an item/photo from the person to direct the Magik toward them. Also, you are begging
    Freya out of nowhere to give you the person you like without any effort on your
    part, so I highly doubt this will work unless you add to it or already work with
    Freya.
