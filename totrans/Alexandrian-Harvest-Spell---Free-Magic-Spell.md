1\. The harvester first performs personal cleansing spells, while simultaneously purifying his or her body, which at that time meant refraining from sexual relations and eating meat, usually for a period of seven days.

2\. Sprinkle natron over the area being harvest.

3\. Place pine resin in a censer and use it to fumigate the area around the chosen plant, circling it three times.

4\. Burn kyphi and pour a libation of milk, while engaged in simultaneous prayer and petition.

5\. Finally pull up the plant, simultaneously invoking the name of the deity to whom the herb is dedicated, requesting assistance with the purpose of your spell.

6\. The uprooted plant is rolled in a pure white linen cloth.

7\. Blend seven wheat seeds and seven barley seeds in some honey. Insert this in the hole left by uprooting the plant and then fill it with dirt.
