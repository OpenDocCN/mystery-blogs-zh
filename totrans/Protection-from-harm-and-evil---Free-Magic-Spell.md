4\. Stand in the center and Chant:

In the shadows, evils hide,
Ready to draw me from love's side,

Banish all that do me wrong.
Send them away, send them astray
Never again to pass my way.
So mote it be

As you say the last three lines, scatter the glitter in a circle around you.

Can I do this spell for a loved one and if so do they need to be in a circle too??

Yes. Just change the wording.

Glitter is a bad idea since that is littering.

Use biodegradable, or possibly substitute the glitter for wildflower seeds or something. Blessed sand or salt would work.
