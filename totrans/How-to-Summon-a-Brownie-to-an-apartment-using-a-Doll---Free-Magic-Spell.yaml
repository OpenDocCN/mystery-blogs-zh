    for it to bring brownies to you that's stupid all you have to do is buy some brownie
    mix and make some brownies yourself

    and watch over your home in exchange for a bowl of milk or cream. They are known
    to pull pranks, be easily offended, and will leave if you gift them new clothes.

- en: I have my doubts this actually works. You make your space friendly to fairys
    and Brownies usually appear. I have only heard of ways to repel Brownies, not
    summon them. From personal experience, they will find their way to you if your
    home has the right energy.
