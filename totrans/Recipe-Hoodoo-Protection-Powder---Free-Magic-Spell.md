*   Tin/baggy/tupperware

*   Sifter

 1) Save the egg shells that are broken for cooking. Be sure to wash them right after they are cracked to keep residue to a minimum, and let them dry thoroughly. Store the clean shells in a tin, tupperware or ziplock bag.

2) When you are ready to make the powder, put the shells into the grinder or blender and grind until they are a fine powder.

3) Sift through a small sifter (often used for dispersing icing sugar onto baked goods) to remove clumps. Grind the clumps more until they are a fine powder.

4) Place fully ground and sifted egg shells into a clean, dry jar and label "Protection Powder". This powder can be used to powder yourself when in need of protection, sprinkle around property, add to protection mojo bags, etc.
