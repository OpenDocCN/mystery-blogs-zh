- en: I have my doubts on this spell. The description seems a little like false advertising.
    If someone who wishes you harm tries to enter your house with a protection, they
    will not be repelled back. They can enter and do harm, they would simply have
    an uneasy feeling while inside. The execution seems off too. All the components
    of a protection spell are there, but the procedure is off. Why put out the incense?
    What type of incense? Why sprinkle salt on the candle? Why chant only when you
    see a yellow flame? You could place a white candle in a bowl of salt and light
    some incense with cleansing or protective properties. As the candle burns, chant
    and imagine your home being safe and secure. The chant is also questionable. Usually,
    when someone is trying to make a spell appear genuine, they will run an English
    chant through Google translate and slap on some Latin. If you do not speak a language,
    do not cast a spell in that language. The language is not important to the divine.
    The chant is there for you to focus and build energy. If you keep stumbling over
    the words and pausing to correct yourself, the spell will be weak.
