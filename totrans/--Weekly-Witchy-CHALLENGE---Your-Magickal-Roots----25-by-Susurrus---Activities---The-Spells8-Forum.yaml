    so much love! I understand being a single mama with a void that needs to be filled.
    I have had that too. I‚Äôm going through something right now that requires self
    love & I‚Äôm learning to listen to myself first. I love my kids with my everything
    & would lay down my life to save them. I think any parent would feel that way
    but I would rather have the time with them now.'

    as I do. I learn so much from each one of you & how everyone‚Äôs path is different.
    I‚Äôm learning to make it my own in my own way. I hope you reach the love you are
    looking for, it‚Äôs there. It will show itself when the time is right.
