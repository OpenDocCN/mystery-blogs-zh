    careful, for you do not want to insult the Great Dragons that will make your special
    dragon. Avoid mistakes such as a Fire Dragon that is blue. Once you are done with
    the drawing, fold it hamburger style and write these down: Name, Age, Personality,
    Element, and Size. Once you are done with that, chant the following:'

    fire, burn it. For water go to the ocean, and "drown" it. For Air, on a windy
    day, let the air carry it. Just know that this will only work for those pure of
    heart, or those that have dragons as otherkin. Good luck! I hope that your dragon
    comes to you, just as Ember came to me.

    few who are Dragon otherkin, but I''m confused about what you''re saying. Did
    you mean you work with Dragons, have them as companions, guides or guardians?'

    work with a little editing as a call to elemental Dragons, but you're not creating
    Dragons so much as calling on a specific type of Dragon for assistance.

    saying spells don't work. Many people comment on don't work, and I try to teach
    people why and what they can do as an alternative. [I even said this spell could
    work if you altered it and made it a call to astral Dragons]Real magick real witches
    work with isn't the same as the magic you see in movies, but you can shift your
    mindset and alter spells so they can work within the natural laws of magick.

- en: This will not summon a dragon. This spell is a basic outline on creating a thoughtform
    or servitor. You are designing something and channeling your energy into that
    form. Think about creating psi balls, it is a similar process but these creatures
    are typically assigned a task to do and will vanish once the task is done or you
    stop giving them energy. You could create one in the shape of a dragon to protect
    your home, but it would not be a real astral dragon. It would just be your energy
    focused on a specific purpose.
