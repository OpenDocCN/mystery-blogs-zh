## Casting Instructions for 'The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram'

 Take a few minutes to relax and when you are ready you may proceed. You will need a Dagger or if you do not have one you may use your index finger. You are going to be tracing Pentagrams in the air, vibrating sacred names of the Gods, and calling upon the Archangels to surround you. You are going to have to visualize these things you do but after much practice you will see the Pentagrams and angels and not have to imagine, because they are really there! 

Now... Take your dagger and stand facing the east. Place the dagger in your right hand and follow the next steps. 
1\. Touch you forehead and vibrate the name (ah-tah). 
2\. Touch the dagger to your chest and vibrate the name (mahl-koot). 
3 .Touch your right shoulder and vibrate name (Vih-G'boo-rah) 
4\. Touch your left shoulder and vibrate the name (Vih-G'doo-Lah) 
5\. Fold your hands at chest and point them forward with the dagger pointing the same direction. Vibrate (Leh-Oh-Lahm) 
6\. Keep hands folded and point them up with dagger pointing the same direction. Vibrate the word (Amen) 
7\. Stay facing the east and trace a pentagram as big as you can in the direction 
Start at the bottom left hand corner... Imagine that as you trace this pentagram it is done in blue flame. So you now have a flaming blue pentagram. Thrust at the middle of the pentagram with the dagger and vibrate the sacred name (Yud-Heh-Vahv-Heh) 
8\. From that point trace a single line in white fire to the South. By this time you should be facing south. Each time you trace a new pentagram, make sure that you are facing the direction that you are pointing in. Now that you are facing south, trace a pentagram in blue flame. Thrust at the middle and vibrate the sacred name (Ah-Doh-Nye) 
9\. Repeat this tracing your line to the West. Thrust at the pentagram and vibrate the sacred name (Eh-Hehee-Yeh) 
10\. Repeat once again this time to the North .Thrusting once again vibrate the sacred name (Ah-Glah) Now trace a line back to the East to finish off the circle.
***You now have 4 blue flaming pentagrams and a circle of white fire surrounding you.*** 
11 .Stretch your arms straight out to the sides and say... 
Before me Ra-Fay-El behind me Gab-Ray-El at my right hand Mih-Chai-El at my left hand Ar-Ree-El around me flames the Pentagram within me shines the six ray star. Visualize these Archangels standing a good 9 feet tall surrounding you. Believe me, they are there. Imagine seeing this six rayed star shining in the middle of your chest. This star is the Hexagram the same shape as the ''Star of David''. 
12\. Repeat steps 1-6 and you are done. 
You are now protected by the Power of the Gods and the Archangels. All spirits that may have been around you are now banished. You are now in the presence of the Gods. If you been conjuring up some type of spirit or have been using the Ouija board, you will want to use this ritual at the end of your Practices. This ritual should be done every day just to protect you and build up your Aura. 

PS- this ritual also helps to drain out your negative energies and protect you from psychic vampires
