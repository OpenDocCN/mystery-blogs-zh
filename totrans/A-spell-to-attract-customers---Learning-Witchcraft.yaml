- en: Wishing you had more customers in your business? If the competition is getting
    a bit high, or you are experiencing a sudden decline in sales, it may be time
    to try this powerful spell that has helped many business owners attract customers.
    As an additional benefit, in case someone has cast a black spell against your
    business which contributes to your hardship, this spell will also cancel out any
    bad effects without unleashing any uncontrollable evil energy.

    outside of your usual business hours to achieve this), light up the beeswax candle,
    dim the lights and meditate quietly for 10 minutes, watching the candle flame
    and mentally focusing on the reasons why you started the business or started working
    for it, noting any negative thoughts and letting go of them.

    Hide the jar and the candle somewhere at the workplace so the power of the spell
    stays with the business.
