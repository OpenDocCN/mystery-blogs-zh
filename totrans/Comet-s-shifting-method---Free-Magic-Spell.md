**How to Ph-shift:**

(Comet's phantom shifting method)

Step 1: Get into a comfortable position and close your eyes. Count to 50 while breathing in and out with every number. Start to meditate.

Step 2: Once you're meditating and are calm, visualise the parts of your animal form (like horns, ears, tail, claws, etc.) forming on your body. Watch them pull themselves out of your body and exist. You should feel tingles and itchiness where the parts should be. 

Step 3: Feel the bones and joints of parts that have them, such as wings or your tail. Feel each joint and move it, you should feel as if you actually have a tail and it is actually moving. 

Step 4: The big part, visualise the rest of your body changing, like being covered in fur or scales, and feel every scale, every piece of fur, move and grow. You should be able to feel the fur/scales/etc move when you move.

And there you go! open your eyes, see you haven't p-shifted, but you feel all the parts of your animal, and you've successfully phantom shifted.

It is possible to phantom shift permanently, and cause permanent phantom limbs, however it can be detrimental to your mental state and energy.

**Comet's M-shifting Method**

To m-shift I use a rather simple (to me) method. 

This method has allowed me to m-shift and m-flare a few times. Most of my m-flares are spontaneous but this has helped bring one on before, and strengthen my instincts after ~2 years of pushing them away.

Step 1 : Get into a comfortable position in a dark room and close your eyes.

Step 2 : Count backwards from 100 down to 0, picturing the sun (your human thoughts, ideas, and rationalism) going down past the horizon and bringing on the night (your animal side, instincts, will to hunt). This step may take a while, but as you count down, push away human thoughts. if they come, count over them. After a while, the numbers should start to sound foreign as you think of your animal side and its instincts, and bring them out as the night begins to rise.

Step 3 : Once you have reached zero and the numbers sound like pointless noises, let your mind take you to a new place. A forest, for example, if you're a wolf or a deer. In that new place, continue looking through your animal. Let your mind and instincts take you. Do you see prey? Chase it. Hunt it. Catch it. Run free, be free.

You are an animal, not human. Be free.

**Comet's P-shifting Method**

My personal p-shifting routine, simplified as I don't know how else to really word what I do.

Step 1: Get into a comfortable, animal-like position in a dark room.

Step 2: Meditate. Visualise yourself laying there.

Step 3: Mental flare and Phantom shift, just for the hell of it.

Step 4: Tell yourself "I am a dragon (or, whatever your animal is)."

Step 5: visualise your body changing and push all of your energy to each part. Feel everything. Know everything. This is natural.

Step 6: Continue, keep feeling, changing, and pushing. Do not open your eyes.

Step 7: When you feel as if you have p-shifted, open your eyes. Check your body for any changes, like discolouration, scales, fur, etc. If you find any, great, keep pushing next time.
