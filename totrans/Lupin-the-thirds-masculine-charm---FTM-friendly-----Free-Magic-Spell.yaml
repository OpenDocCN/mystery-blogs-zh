    part of your hair/bangs are too long, I would highly recommend using scissors
    to cut them. Look at a picture of Lupin for reference. His bangs are in a short
    V-shape on his forehead in the middle. (If your bangs are just right already,
    just skip this step.) Then, use hair gel or pomade (a little bit, not a lot!)
    to fix the style. Then, put on the belt, tie and jacket. Make sure the tie color
    coordinates with the color jacket. Spray yourself with the scent you made, and
    affirm: "I am confident like Lupin. I have masculine charm like him. Ladies/other
    guys like me and will want to hang out/ask me out/want to date me."**'

- en: Will this physically transform you into the character? No. Will the physically
    change your gender? No. HOWEVER, as a confidence spell and glamour, it has potential.
    As the creator said, this will help you be like the character. Reading this over,
    there are a few minor adjustments I would make. The biggest one being the chant.
    I understand you preform the first half in anticipation for the actual spell,
    but it is a little pointless, and the chant undermines itself. Chants and affirmations
    should state facts because you are telling the universe what you desire. ''I am
    like Lupin'' would work better than ''I will be like Lupin'' because one is confident
    and the other is a desire. Also, I question the timeframe of the spell, because
    it is hard to specify how long a spell works, so it makes me question how real
    this spell is. Dressing up like Lupin, say you are confident and manly, wearing
    a scent associated with male energies, all of these are fine. I would enchant
    the scented mist you created. After casting this spell, use the spray before leaving
    the house. Look in the mirror, spray your body, and say the chant ''I am as confident
    as Lupin. I am as masculine as Lupin. I am as charming as Lupin.'' This would
    work to charge your energy, cast a glamour, and make people perceive you how you
    desire. Also, this can be altered for any character you admire. You will still
    look like you, but your energy and others perception of you will change.
