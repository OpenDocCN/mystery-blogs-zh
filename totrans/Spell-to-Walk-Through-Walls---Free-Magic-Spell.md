**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   a comfy place to lay down

*   blue candles

*   white paper

*   pen with blue ink

*   45 minutes or longer

Start by lighting the blue candles. You can do this around your bed (only if its safe!) or by placing the candles on your altar. Please keep the candles away from all things flammable and in a fire proof dish.
Write your intention on the paper. Draw a stick figure of you and a circle around it. Fold the paper and place it under your head.
Next you must work on quieting the mind with deep trance, hypnosis or meditation. If you have trouble with this try using the search bar to search for tips. You can also find guided meditations on youtube. At this point you should be laying with the paper under your head.
Meditate and see yourself walking through walls. If you are still conscious when you feel a tingling senstation on your third eye chakra try moving your hand through a solid surface nearby. Please remember! Even getting this very tip of your figure through the solid surface can take many attempts.

Your astral form could walk through walls, but your physical form cannot. I'm unsure which this user is referring to, but if you think you can physically walk through walls you cannot, it defies nature, therefore it does not work.

I don't know . A sledge hammer and a strong swing could do the trick for physically penetrating a wall . :-)

True. But that is not one of the ingredients for this spell. This specific spell does not work. But, a sledge hammer can indeed help you walk through a wall. Make sure it is not a load bearing wall.
