- en: The most fundamental aspect of telepathic communication with animals is an understanding
    of 'grounding'. Grounding, within the field of electrical theory, is a return
    path for electrical current; a direct connection to the earth, typically. So too
    is it for rituals of natural origin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Telepathic communication is fundamentally astral; that is, it exists of another
    plane. As such, a ground is required through which astral energy can flow freely
    into our dimension.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This elixir works by creating a region-specific ground to a specific animal's
    ancestral point of origin. By linking astral energies with this point, a strong
    metaphysical bond can be temporarily established.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Telepathic communication is made possible by the link of astral energies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this specific case, the ingredients have been chosen to reflect the target
    animal's ancestral point of origin; the grapes and anise seed are ingredients
    of a beverage traditionally consumed in the Middle East, the domestic house cat's
    point of origin; the agate, a precious stone of reputed magical power also found
    in the region; and various other ingredients associated with such elixirs.

    focusing techniques in Appendix section), an environment free of distractions,
    the elixir, and the cat with which the user intends to communicate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to variation in ingredient quality, user experience, and atmospheric disturbances,
    there is no accurate recommendation regarding the amount to be consumed. As a
    general rule, users should begin with small quantities no more than three or four
    mouthfuls in order to gauge the effects of the elixir. Once a baseline has been
    established, carefully consume the amount necessary to the first stage of the
    ritual.

    making users aware of subconscious channels, or electrical fields. Those channels

    time to improve one's technique; therefore, you should not be surprised if you
    initially find it difficult to communicate with your target. As your experience

    more receptive to communication, and may converse more freely and with greater
    detail.
