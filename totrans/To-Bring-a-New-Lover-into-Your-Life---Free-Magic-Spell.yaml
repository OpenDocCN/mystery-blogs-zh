    Be sure to draw this person as you'd like them to be. Somethings to consider when
    drawing this person are height, hair, clothes, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Write down some characteristics that you'd like that person to have next to
    the drawing of them you made. Be sure to be specific, how do they act? Are they
    funny? Are they kind? Loving? Healthy? You could add that they'll love you always,
    just something along this lines.

    I create, I bring forth a new mate. Let him/her see the best in me, please bring
    my love back to me and so it is done, for I will be won, so I decree, so mote
    it be." Honestly, you could change it if you''d like though. Now fold the paper
    towards you and burn it. Once you have done that throw the ashes to the wind.
    Good luck.'
