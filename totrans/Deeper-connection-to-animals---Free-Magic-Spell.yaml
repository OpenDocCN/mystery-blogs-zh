    emotional connection with the object that represents that animal. Then imagine
    all the energy from your heart racing down your arms into the charm. Wait till
    the charm is warm to the touch before setting it in front of you. Put your right
    hand over your left both going diagonally and say 'Dear, (deity(s)) form a bond
    between us, sharing our emotions through a tether. Let us heal each other to make
    one better.' Imagine golden light spilling out from under your hands. 'Hold us
    together through thick and thin, when one of us succeeds we both win. I enchant
    thee stone, feather, or fur to protect and enhance our sacred bond so that we
    can become more fond.' Slide your hands out to form a triangle with your fingers.
    'When I have my charm with me our souls tethered will be. But if the charm lies
    alone the enhanced bond shall be unsewn.' Pick up the charm and have it with you
    when you'd like the bond to be enhanced, if strong emotions are felt on their
    end then the charm will heat up. If you can find a way have them there for the
    spell and make them a charm that represents you.
