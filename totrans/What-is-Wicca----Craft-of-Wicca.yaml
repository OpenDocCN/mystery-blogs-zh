    bring meaning to their life. Is it a religion? Is it a tradition? Are there rules?

    okay. I’ll use this article to explain how I think about these things so that
    you can have some understanding of the rest of the site.

    books out at the time, but far, far fewer than today.

    Cunningham. My journey has evolved my philosophy of Wicca, and I haven’t even
    read those books in a decade.

- en: Wicca is a religion in a sense. Most practices aim at creating a personal connection
    with nature and the divine. The religion is not organized, and it does not have
    a set of beliefs that must be held. There are no religious texts that must be
    held as truth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this sense, many might consider Wicca a spiritual path rather than a religion.
    There are endless debates about how Wicca fits into other religious paths, but
    my personal philosophy is that Wicca should be open and accepting of all faiths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There can be Christian Wiccans that use ancient traditions to build a deeper
    relationship with their Christian understanding of God. There can be atheist Wiccans
    that emphasize practices that build their relationship to nature.

- en: It is up to the individual to figure out how the craft of Wicca fits into their
    lives and beliefs. We live in an age of natural destruction, and so the more people
    who develop a reverence for nature, no matter how contradictory their beliefs
    may look to an outsider, the better it will be for our planet and future as humans.

    Wiccan practices.'

  prefs: []

- en: Ask anyone who has participated in a shamanic ritual if it worked, and they
    will laugh. Sweat lodges and peyote ceremonies truly alter a person’s consciousness.
    These practices can awaken lifelong changes in a person as they realize the world
    as seen in front of them is not the whole picture.

    drumbeat about their experiences. They will talk about how the whole world melted
    away, and they were left with profound indescribable feelings and a connection
    to nature and the other people around them.

    describe the loss of sense of self and feelings of gratitude.

    from shamanic spiritual traditions, to naturally alter our consciousness to commune
    with nature and the divine.

- en: It is a testament to many people’s bias against the term “Wiccan” to then wonder
    if the same types of practices “work.” Whether you call it God, the Goddess, the
    Divine, nature, or the human spirit, it doesn’t matter.
  prefs: []

- en: Wicca is the practice of ritual to commune with this transcendent, universal
    aspect. This is also why it is such a deeply personal journey. Every person will
    find variations that work better for them.

    that uses magic. Magic is an often misunderstood term. It refers to the transformations
    that occur when performing Wiccan rituals.
  prefs: []

    produced from ritual let us see these underlying aspects to move and alter them.
    Magic should be used to improve ourselves and the world around us.

    Anyone who tries to do harm or bend nature to their will is in for some trouble.
    You get back what you put in threefold (often called the “threefold rule”).

    someone harm, you would be far better going a different path.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ll reiterate that magic is natural, not supernatural. Wiccan rituals tap into
    the already present natural energy to do magic. Though the process can be awe-inducing
    and transformative, there is nothing paranormal about it.

    do not. I may occasionally use the term “witch” to refer to all genders of Wiccan
    practitioners in the context of magic.
