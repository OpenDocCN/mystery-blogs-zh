**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Water

*   Dried flower petals (any kind)

*   Pentagram on a piece of paper

 Wet your hair, make sure it's COMPLETELY soaked. Set down your pentagram on a flat surface. Then set your LIT candle in the center of the pentagram. Make your middle and index fingers touch one of the points on the pentagram, and have your other hand hovering above the candle. When you feel the heat from the candle going through your hand burn 2 of your flower petals in the flames, then say this spell 2x.

"Luscious locks is what I want, and (any color) eyes that I may flaunt, stretch my hair and make it grow, like a river going to and fro, no knots in my hair are to be found, it grows until it touches the ground, glimmering in the dark of night, my eyes shall show but not too bright, my eyes shall shine like the evening star, they shall be the prettiest by far, oh goddess Aphrodite of love and beauty, this is my will so mote it be!"

Then burry the ashes from the flower petals and the pentagram you used somewhere safe. After you burry these things put both hands on the place of which you buried them and say: "this is my will, so mote it be".

At best, you might cast a glamour so other perceive you a certain way, but I am almost certain this is fake and does not work. You cannot physically transform. If your eyes are brown, no spell will make them green.

Honestly what's wrong with you? Every spell I look at you always say it dose not work or its fake! Just let people do it without your 2 sense!
