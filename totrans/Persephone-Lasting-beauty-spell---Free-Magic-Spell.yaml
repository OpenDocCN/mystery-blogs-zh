- en: No. This spell is utter nonsense. Magic cannot physically change your body.
    Chanting, make me pretty, make me pretty, won't do anything at all. It might be
    modifiable into something like a glamour, which I see as having a psychological
    affect on the person who cast it, rather than controlling how someone else sees
    them or how they actually appear.

- en: This does not work. If you do not work with Persephone, do not bother her, especially
    without an offering. Logically, why would dripping pomegranate juice on a necklace
    grant you eternal beauty? If you wish to cast a glamour so others perceive you
    a certain way, research homemade beauty products like facemasks and scrubs, and
    look up the Magikal correspondences of the ingredients used. Use items with beauty
    and self-love energies, charge Magikal energy as you make these items, and reflect
    on your desired goal once you apply them to your body. Chanting can help add to
    the energy, but so can lighting candles or placing crystals nearby.
