 ## Casting Instructions for 'Purification Spell (To Break a Curse)'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   13 White candles

*   Hot water

*   1 Cup sea salt

*   1 Tablespoon sage

*   1 Tablespoon lavender

*   1 Tablespoon chamomile

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   13 White candles

*   Hot water

*   1 Cup sea salt

*   1 Tablespoon sage

*   1 Tablespoon lavender

*   1 Tablespoon chamomile

 On the night after the full moon and just before bed, light 13 candles, preferably white. Fill the tub up with hot water (as hot as you can stand to sit in). Add 1 cup sea salt, 1 tablespoon sage, 1 tablespoon lavender and 1 tablespoon chamomile. Turn off the water and let the bath steep in the herbs. Kneel or sit in front of the tub, in the nude, and repeat this incantation:

"What was done was done. Be it now undone. By the light of the full moon's wane: cleanse my soul of taint and stain. Let my hurtful spell reverse and life from me this vicious curse. As I enter now this sacred space, return my spirit to its grace".

Enter the bath and let the water cleanse away the effects of the curse. Use your hands to gather up the water and pour it 3 times of your head. Each time you do, repeat:

Accept my apologies for what was done
Disperse my spell with the morning's sun

Remain in the bath until the water cools. Drain the tub and rinse off. Snuff the candles and go to sleep. By dawn the curse will be broken and you will once again find that feeling of "blessedness" that you lost.
