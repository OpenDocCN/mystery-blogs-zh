- en: First, place some cinnamon powder into the bowl. Make sure you have everything
    ready so you can make the cinnamon cones. With one tablespoon, slowly add in water
    into the bowl with the cinnamon powder. Make sure it is not too much or you will
    mess up the job. Keep mixing the water with the cinnamon using the other spoon
    until it turns into a dirt like substance. It will look like dirt once it is sucessfully
    done. After you're done with the mixing, you pick up some cinnamon with your hands
    and form a triangle on the plate. You do this for as long as you like and make
    how many cones you want.
