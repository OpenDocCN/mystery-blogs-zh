    those witches are trying to do is explain no amount of belief will change reality.
    Magik is a neutral energy that brings natural change. Spells change the vibration

- en: It was difficult to understand with your random punctuations, but as Tadashi
    said, no. No amount of belief will change reality. You can believe the earth is
    flat, but it'll still be round. You could believe you could fly by flapping your
    arms. You could do this every day, but it won't change the fact humans can't physically
    fly by nature. Humans are inventors by nature, so a spell to inspire you to create
    a new flying device is in the realm of possibility. Same with transformation.
    Werewolves are astral beings, you can work with them as part of your spiritual
    team. On other planes of existence [mental, astral, ethereal] magick has less
    rigid rules and more is possible. No amount of conviction, belief or practice
    will make you physically transform with magick, but you can use it in other ways

    Especially when you are perpetuating a stereotype. Yes, there are certain tribes
    who believe in transformation into an animal form **however,** this is not something
    every Indigenous person can do or believe in. Those who do believe it is a gift
    only the wisest shaman of the tribe can learn. So, let us assume in this instance
    it is possible. Even if it *is* possible, which it is not, only a handful of spiritual
    masters can do it. No spell you found online will make you a werewolf. Do you
    honestly believe a shaman would post the most sacred ritual on a forum site that
    is primarily visited by teenagers?! Because if you do, I should warn you about
    secret messages in songs when you play the recording backwards. And while I am
    confused by your devil worshiper line, I assume you think they are blessed with
    satanic powers? No. You will not gain special powers if you work with a certain
    deity. Those who work with Lucifer work with him to heal trauma, not for nefarious
    intent. As for a literal Satan, the number who pray to the Christian devil is
    incredibly low. Most Satanists are Atheist's.

    myself, Draq, HearthWitch, Prsna [User393658], Rhodendron, Tadashi, or Weide as
    I'm not in the mood to repeat myself. As for my username, I've explained this
    A LOT on this site [might just post it on my profile if it would help] when I
    was little, I was babysat by a Japanese lady who taught me some Japanese and introduced
    me to the culture which I've been fascinated in ever since [yes, I like anime,
    but I also know the language, history, and culture of Japan because it's one of
    the thing's I studied growing up] As a little kid, I made up a story about some
    cats, each one was just named ''Number cat'' [nekoichi, nekoni, so on] and my
    favourite was Nekoshi [forth cat] and would use that name a lot in stories and
    games I'd play. In middle school, I was going through a bit of a goth phase and
    learned ''Shi'' was another word for ''Death'' and the character's name became
    ''Death cat.'' I added the ''Ma'' to the end when I learned about its meaning
    as this land of nothing place in Japanese folklore. So, all through my teens [and
    to this day because branding] my username across platforms is Nekoshema [the ''she''
    being spelled ''she'' and not ''she'' was because I was a girl and wanted people
    to know that. Because 12] So, there you go, the history of my username. If you
    find a Nekoshema somewhere online, there is a 99% chance it's me [which means
    I really should delete my more embarrassing fanfics before Google rats me out
    for stuff I posted in my teens] However, I hope you're not trying to pull an ''On
    behalf of the Japanese, how dare you use Nihongo for a username'' because that's
    ridiculous. Japanese isn't a closed practice, nobody is claiming to be Japanese,
    and the only people who are getting hurt are those who actually know Japanese
    and are cringing at the bad Japanese names on display. Believe me, you're doing
    more cultural damage by perpetuating the indigenous stereotypes, not only the
    inappropriate term but the tribe who believes in shapeshifting becoming ''All
    natives believe this.'' The Quileute tribe does believe the greatest shaman can
    learn to shapeshift, but it does not mean everyone can and every indigenous person
    believes this culturally. The Quileute have been fighting to undo this stereotype
    popularized by Stephanie Meyer but people keep coming to their towns and asking
    about it. [blessing and a curse, really, as it gets tourists which generates money]

    [如果有帮助的话，可能会在我的个人资料上发布] 当我还小的时候，我是由一位日本女士照看的，她教了我一些日语，并向我介绍了日本文化，从那时起我就对此着迷。 [是的，我喜欢动漫，但我也了解这个语言、历史和文化，因为这是我在成长过程中学习的东西之一]
    当我还是个小孩的时候，我编了一个关于一些猫的故事，每只猫都只叫''Number cat'' [nekoichi、nekoni等等] 我最喜欢的是Nekoshi
    [第四只猫]，我经常在故事和游戏中使用那个名字。在中学时期，我经历了一段有点哥特风格的阶段，学到''Shi''是''Death''的另一个词，这个角色的名字变成了''Death
    cat.'' 当我了解到它在日本民间故事中的意义时，我在末尾添加了''Ma''，表明这是一个虚无之地。所以，从青少年时期到现在 [因为品牌] 我跨平台的用户名都是Nekoshema
    [''she''被拼写为''she''而不是''she''是因为我是个女孩，我希望人们知道这一点。因为12岁] 所以，你看，这就是我的用户名的历史。如果你在网上找到了一个叫Nekoshema的人，99%的可能性是我
    [这意味着我真的应该在Google把我在青少年时期发布的更尴尬的同人作品删除之前删除它们] 但是，我希望你不要试图代表日本人说''你怎么敢用日语作为用户名''，因为那太荒谬了。日语并不是封闭的实践，没有人声称自己是日本人，而且真正受到伤害的只是那些真正懂日语的人，他们在看到展示不良日语名字时感到尴尬。相信我，通过延续土著的刻板印象，你正在造成更多的文化伤害，不仅是不恰当的术语，而且还有一个部落认为变形成''所有土著人都相信这一点''。Quileute部落确实相信最伟大的萨满能够学会变形，但这并不意味着每个人都能够以及每个土著人都相信这一点。Quileute一直在努力消除由斯蒂芬妮·梅尔流行化的这一刻板印象，但人们还在来他们的城镇询问这个问题。

    However because 'belief beating reality' has been a running theme I feel my experiences
    and learning are uniquely qualifying (and the reason I chose to weigh-in finally
    to begin with.) I am a part of the Otberkin communities. Both in and also of it
    for over twenty-five years as a Draconic.

  zh: 我很少在谈话中提及这一点，除非有充分的理由。然而，因为“信念战胜现实”一直是一个主题，我觉得我的经验和学习是独特合格的（这也是我最终选择发表意见的原因）。我是Otberkin社区的一部分。作为一只龙族，我已经参与其中超过二十五年。
- en: That means that I have spent over half of my life not only believing I am at
    least partly something other-than human, that belief has held firm for the entirety
    of those twenty-five years despite my best efforts to prove myself wrong. I am
    not Draconic because I want to become one. I am Draconic because I am unable to
    convince myself otherwise. It is a basic fact within my own mind. So intrinsic
    I don't really even explore it any more because it is me... that's it. Nothing
    fancy or special. A belief so natural that there is no convincing to be had. No
    change to make or strive for because it is already there. A part of me as natural
    and integrated as being able to look at my feet and wiggle my toes. And yet there
    is no effort I could ever expend that would express that Draconic nature externally
    in any physical way no matter how microscopic or temporary.

  zh: 这意味着我已经度过了我生命的一大半，不仅相信我至少在某种程度上是其他人类的一部分，而且这种信念在这二十五年间始终如一，尽管我尽力证明自己错了。我不是因为想成为其中之一才认为自己是龙族的。我是因为无法说服自己相反。这是我自己思想中的基本事实。它是如此本质，以至于我不再去探索它，因为它就是我...
    就这样。没有花哨或特别的东西。一种如同看着我的脚并摇动我的脚趾一样自然的信念。然而，无论我如何微小或暂时地尝试，我都无法外在表达那种龙族的本性。

    unwavering on my aspirations. Regardless of belief, I persist in pursuing my dreams,
    relying on self-affirmation like a practiced spell. Reciting it in my mind, not
    on paper or phone, I sense a potent energy resonating with nature, particularly
    trees. It's a silent call, an energetic presence within me, offering a constant
    source of power. This energy holds potential for positive endeavors, even challenging
    the laws of physics. The journey is still unfolding, and my ultimate destination
    is yet to be defined.

- en: It's been explained multiple times before [not only on this spell, but elsewhere
    on the site] why physical transformation is not possible with real magick, what
    is possible with real magick, and how you can actually utilize werewolves in your
    craft. Werewolves are astral beings. You call on them like any other spirit in
    your craft. You can also use their imagery in your craft to symbolically call
    on their energy. You can mentally, astrally, and spiritually shift from human
    to other beings. Physically, it is not possible. Magick on the physical has very
    strict rules and structure. [this is why most of us ''non-believers'' as we've
    been dubbed advocate astral projection as it is possible on other planes of existence]
    Magick on the physical doesn't contradict nature. A human can't think ''I'm going
    to be a fox'' and then physically morph into a fox, but we can think about becoming
    a fox when we begin a meditation and mentally become a fox during the meditation.
    All you have to do is shift your perspective a little and you can work with werewolves
    in your practice [sadly, too many dig in their heels and refuse to budge despite
    all the evidence those who have been practicing longer have provided] as for that
    link, quora isn't a reputable source of information [I'd argue Wikipedia has more
    credibility] it can be used to speak with likeminded people, but evidence isn't
    UPG [unverified personal gnoses] You can use UPG, I use UPG in my craft all the
    time, but when it comes to educating new members on Witchcraft, and providing
    evidence for your claims, a forum where someone goes ''I agree with you'' isn't
    evidence.

  zh: 之前已经多次解释过[不仅仅是在这个咒语上，还在网站的其他地方]为什么真正的魔法不可能导致物理上的变形，真正的魔法能做什么，以及如何在你的实践中实际利用狼人。狼人是星界存在。你可以像在你的实践中召唤其他精灵一样召唤它们。你还可以在你的实践中使用它们的形象来象征性地调用它们的能量。你可以在精神上、星界上和灵魂上从人类转变为其他生物。在物质上，这是不可能的。物质层面上的魔法有非常严格的规则和结构。[这就是为什么我们大多数"非信徒"，如我们所称，主张星界投射，因为在其他存在的平面上这是可能的]
    物质层面上的魔法不会违反自然法则。一个人不能想"我要变成狐狸"然后在物理上变成一只狐狸，但是我们可以在开始冥想时想象成为一只狐狸，并且在冥想期间在精神上成为一只狐狸。你所要做的就是稍微转变你的视角，这样你就可以在你的实践中与狼人一起工作。[不幸的是，太多人在这方面顽固地拒绝改变，尽管那些练习时间更长的人提供了所有证据]
    至于那个链接，quora并不是一个可靠的信息来源[我会争辩说维基百科更可信] 它可以用来与志同道合的人交流，但证据并不是个人未经验证的直觉。你可以在你的实践中使用个人未经验证的直觉，我在我的实践中经常使用个人未经验证的直觉，但是当涉及对巫术新成员进行教育和为你的主张提供证据时，一个人说"我同意你"的论坛并不是证据。

    However how do you know what my friend and I can do. I'm not stupid, But as for
    my bio, I give some information about me, And what things i done so far. For the
    site rules it's fine, they are here to protect us, like as the police. However
    ig i found a hole in our time, and yet I'm still too afraid to Even go on adventure,
    and try things, But ig my parentes would Be afraid, if i was missing some day.
    But path is a path, time works as a path and let you go. Also I don't Even know
    how I'm doing it, but it's like i can view to things the normal world and another
    world, In the outher world i saw a totem bird it was kinda cute, self if it had
    neon blues eyes, it was small, and it's in my room but nerver with neon blue eyes,
    sometimes it feels like the outher world is takling me with All it's power, Like

  zh: Nekoshema 很高兴见到你，我猜。首先抱歉违反了网站的规则。但是你怎么知道我和我的朋友能做什么。我并不愚蠢，但至于我的个人简介，我提供了一些关于我和迄今为止做过的事情的信息。对于网站的规则没问题，它们在这里保护我们，就像警察一样。但我发现我们的时间有漏洞，但我仍然太害怕去冒险，尝试事情，但我父母可能会担心，如果有一天我失踪了。但道路就是一条路，时间就像一条路，让你走下去。而且我甚至不知道我是如何做到的，但就像我可以看到正常世界和另一个世界一样，在另一个世界里，我看到了一个图腾鸟，它有点可爱，自己有着霓虹蓝色的眼睛，它很小，在我的房间里，但从来没有霓虹蓝色的眼睛，有时候感觉就像另一个世界正在用它所有的力量与我交谈，就像它在呼唤我的名字，我想那是某种东西，我在我的短短16年里看到了很多事情，甚至没有赚到自己的钱。致敬

- en: Regarding the rules, I don't know why some are the way they are. Some make sense
    like no roleplaying [this is a site for actual witches and witchcraft can be confusing,
    so the less misinformation the better. As for these fake spells, unfortunately,
    they bring traffic to the site, which brings ad revenue, and keeps the site free]
    Spamming replies can make it difficult to find information. All caps, I'm not
    entirely sure on that one. I'd assume it's similar to no textspeak or using any
    language other than English [it makes replies easier to understand] Breaking any
    of these rules can get your account gagged by a mod without warning [and arguing
    with a mod on a said decision can get your new account gagged too] I personally
    feel bad people can log in and discover their account has been gagged without
    warning, so if I see a minor rule violation, I give the user a heads up [if it's
    something like swearing, scams or threatening members, however, instant report

  zh: 关于规则，我不知道为什么有些规则是这样的。有些规则是有道理的，比如不允许角色扮演[这是一个真正的女巫网站，女巫术可能令人困惑，所以误导越少越好。至于这些假咒语，不幸的是，它们会给网站带来流量，带来广告收入，并保持网站免费]
    刷屏回复会使查找信息变得困难。全大写字母，我对这个不太确定。我会假设它类似于不使用文本语言或使用除英语以外的任何语言[这样回复更容易理解] 违反任何这些规则都可能导致您的帐户被版主禁言而没有警告[与版主就某个决定争论也可能导致您的新帐户被禁言]
    我个人觉得人们可以登录后发现他们的帐户被禁言而没有警告，所以如果我看到轻微的违规行为，我会提醒用户[如果是类似咒骂、欺诈或威胁成员之类的事情，立即举报以保持社区安全]
- en: '@AlphaChange, you claim you and your friends can physically shapeshift [or
    at least it''s possible] I know this isn''t possible because of decades of research
    not only in witchcraft but werewolves [I''ve been a huge fan of werewolves since
    a kid] the lack of physical evidence, and the fact people can lie indiscriminately
    online, leads me to conclude what you''re saying is untrue. Also, the human ego
    is a powerful thing [this doesn''t mean you''re a narcissist or anything, the
    ego in psychology refers to your personality. the part of you that feels special.
    Even if you have low self-esteem, your ego is the part of you that refuses to
    admit you might be awesome] so if you come to a site like this and start claiming
    the impossible is possible, you might gain a few ''''Haters'''' who point out
    why what your claim isn''t true, but you''ll also get a bunch of praise from those
    who want to believe. [And those of us saying why something isn''t possible hurts
    their ego, causing them to lash out and double down] Point is, I know what is
    and isn''t possible, and I worry those who don''t will see these false claims
    and it does more harm to them in the long run. [But, if you still insist what
    you''re saying is true and refuse to accept evidence to the contrary, that''s
    your choice. I''ve provided information and my explanation, and since neither
    one of us will budge, this is where the conversation ends. I wish you all the
