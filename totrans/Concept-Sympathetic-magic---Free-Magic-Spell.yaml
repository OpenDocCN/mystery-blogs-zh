    a subject but a concept link to an object.

    kind such as a plant, notebook, etc. Once you have that you have to go or get
    something or somewhere to find that concept of choice,then you have to bind it
    to an object of your choice how you do that is up to you once you did that then
    your finish but I would make sure it worked, now you can manipulate that concept
    or redirect it or stop it, bind it whatever. Have fun and hopefully no one has
    thought of it and created it I don't want to be a complete idiot.
