- en: As mentioned in the description, unless you work with the Christian God, this
    spell will not work for you. I would fix the blessing so it is less complicated,
    but it can work. You are creating a rule for spirits to enter, and while not all
    will obey, it is something which would stop a number of spirits. You should put
    up more protections and leave this as a last-ditch effort. If this works, you
    would sense a spirit near the rice. You should take it outside, and bury it off
    property and sprinkle rosemary and ground eggshells to purify it. Be sure to take
    the long way home and not look back as this could result in the spirit following
    you.
