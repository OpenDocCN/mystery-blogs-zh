THis is a joke but a good one but it wont work

What is with this *activate* trend in spells? This is not a spell, just insulting and further tarnishes our credibility.

I suppose ''spellname, activate'' could be a trigger praise for a real spell if set up in advance (at least I think that's a thing), but yes, this is obviously not a real spell at all.

Theoretically, yes. So mote it be or so shall it be are more common endings to spells. See also *amen* for Christians to end a prayer. Whatever you feel indicates the end of a spell, or as a way to release the energy, go with that. However, my issue is so many fake spells are claiming you just say *activate* and **boom** you cast a spell. No. When you say *so mote it be* it indicates you have concluded the spell. You should have built energy and have been directing it toward your goal before you reach that phrase. These spells claim you simple point and say *activate* and you have cast a spell. Infuriating. Spells require ***a lot*** more effort than that. If you personally wish to use *activate* at the end of the spell, go for it. But the vast majority of The Pagan Community does not. With the influx of these nonsense posts, I worry it will become a new *hex the moon* situation. It is hard enough to be taken seriously without this absurdity.

I'll never get that 3mins it took me to read this back ...üôÑüòí
