  id: totrans-40

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    three times, it usually indicates that you need emotional or spiritual security
    rather than physical (represented by 4 itself).

    you can confide in, someone who you can trust with your deepest, scariest feelings.
    None of us like to be vulnerable, so we usually won’t share these thoughts (including
    past hurts and negative self-beliefs) until we’re sure we can trust someone.
  id: totrans-43

    security with someone (and stop putting your energy into people who *don’t* give
    you this sense of safety), or it can simply be an indicator that you have *already*
    found this emotional security.
  id: totrans-44
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    within *yourself*. If you don’t understand your emotions then you can’t harness
    them for good. Without understanding, your feelings can quickly get out of control.
    You might find it hard to operate from a place of inner peace, or you could experience
    anxiety, fear, or rage all too often.
  id: totrans-45
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your angels are telling you that understanding is the *key* to security. You
    must first learn how to understand *what* you feel and *why* you feel it before
    you can know your emotions. Ignoring your emotions won’t create any inner security,
    because they will always be there, and may bubble up at unexpected times. Instead,
    learn more about your emotions and why they exist. Every emotion you have exists
    for a very good purpose!

    self-therapy (cognitive-behavior exercises) can aid you in getting to the root

    security instead. This can indicate one of two things.

    there are many wonderful spiritual beings out there, entities also exist. There
    can’t be positive without negative, and you need to know how to protect yourself
    from low-vibrational spirits, entities, or other creatures who may seek to harm
    you.

    spirit beings cannot harm you on the physical plane. However, they *can* make

    If you have an entity attached to you, then you’ll probably feel more drained
    than usual.
  id: totrans-50

    Wards are the energetic bare minimum and are preventative barriers that stop energy

    it may be helpful to learn how to banish or defend yourself spiritually in a more
    aggressive nature.

    for Angel Number 444 are related to each other (new beginnings and change), so
    it’s perfectly normal to feel like this number applies to your life in more than
    one way. The Angels try to save words when possible!

    soul is with the Angels.

    and protection. While 4 is more about material things, 444 takes this a step further.
    It has the same stable vibes but is more about energetic stability rather than
    physical stability and success.

    of practice you do in everyday life instead of the “grand ideas” behind spirituality.
