    we will see something so many times over and over again until it goes beyond mere
    coincidence.

    They represent an insight into our lives with the help of divine intervention.
    In fact, every number has a specific, scientific meaning that correlates with
    numerology, so angel numbers are another form of divination, much like Tarot cards.

    that encompasses meaning beyond just its numeric value. When you see an angel
    number, you can know that the number appeared because of the *frequency* of the
    message, not just because someone arbitrarily decided on a meaning for that specific

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    balanced, you should be connected to all four elements in a somewhat equal fashion.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    still have these elements *incorporated* into your life to keep your energetic
    center balanced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    so Angel Number 444 is giving you the message that you must connect with *all
    four* elements to be truly stabilized. After all, the number 444 is all about
    spiritual stability, and much of this comes from working with the elements in
    harmony.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water) in different ways.

    and draw on the energy of each element.

  prefs: []

    (for example, incorporate more mirrors in a room to bring in the water element).
    You can also travel and work with the energy of each element, or do a meditation
    to connect with water, air, fire, or earth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    For example, I will place (in a circular fashion around me) incense for air, a
    small fountain for water, a burning candle for fire, and a plant for earth. I
    find that these energies help to balance me during my meditation. There are many
    types of meditation that you can do even if you’re not an expert!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Try to take note of which element you feel the most connected to and which elements
    you need to forge a connection with. If you’re feeling low on your connection
    with water, take a walk to the nearest body of water and sit by it for a few minutes.
    To connect with the earth, head to a local park or even sit outside with your
    bare feet on the ground. Close your eyes and breathe in the wind (air) or read
    by a flickering candle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although this may not seem like much, connecting with the elements can *really*
    help to balance you emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually. If this
    feels true for you, then know that angel number 444 is a sign to bring yourself
    into balance using the elements here on earth.

- en: 5\. Develop A Strong Sense Of Emotional Or Spiritual Security
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angel number 444 is all about security. However, because the number 4 is repeated
    three times, it usually indicates that you need emotional or spiritual security
    rather than physical (represented by 4 itself).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Emotional and spiritual security can each have many different meanings. After
    all, the idea of security takes on many different forms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you think about emotional security, you might imagine having someone who
    you can confide in, someone who you can trust with your deepest, scariest feelings.
    None of us like to be vulnerable, so we usually won’t share these thoughts (including
    past hurts and negative self-beliefs) until we’re sure we can trust someone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, angel number 444 is a sign that you either need to find this emotional
    security with someone (and stop putting your energy into people who *don’t* give
    you this sense of safety), or it can simply be an indicator that you have *already*
    found this emotional security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just as often, angel number 444 means that you need to develop emotional security
    within *yourself*. If you don’t understand your emotions then you can’t harness
    them for good. Without understanding, your feelings can quickly get out of control.
    You might find it hard to operate from a place of inner peace, or you could experience
    anxiety, fear, or rage all too often.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your angels are telling you that understanding is the *key* to security. You
    must first learn how to understand *what* you feel and *why* you feel it before
    you can know your emotions. Ignoring your emotions won’t create any inner security,
    because they will always be there, and may bubble up at unexpected times. Instead,
    learn more about your emotions and why they exist. Every emotion you have exists
    for a very good purpose!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    self-therapy (cognitive-behavior exercises) can aid you in getting to the root
    of your inner emotional landscape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, sometimes angel number 444 indicates that you need to develop *spiritual*
    security instead. This can indicate one of two things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, you may need to put up wards or practice spiritual protection. While
    there are many wonderful spiritual beings out there, entities also exist. There
    can’t be positive without negative, and you need to know how to protect yourself
    from low-vibrational spirits, entities, or other creatures who may seek to harm
    you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s no need to *totally* freak out when reading this. 99.99% of the time,
    spirit beings cannot harm you on the physical plane. However, they *can* make
    you feel depressed, lethargic, angry, or instill other negative emotions in you.
    If you have an entity attached to you, then you’ll probably feel more drained
    than usual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might also need spiritual protection from the energy of living people here
    on earth. If you’re susceptible to energy, then you pick up more energy than usual,
    especially when you’re around large groups of people. This can *really* zap you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although energetic susceptibility is common for starseeds, it can happen to
    anyone. When you start to become more spiritual, your chakras begin to open, but
    you also become more susceptible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In either of these cases, you need to learn how to put up wards around yourself.
    Wards are the energetic bare minimum and are preventative barriers that stop energy
    from seeping through or attaching to you. Once you get comfortable with wards,
    it may be helpful to learn how to banish or defend yourself spiritually in a more
    aggressive nature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    salt bath at least once a week to dispel any negative energy. You can also do
    a cleansing meditation (such as a chakra cleanse) to energetically clear out low
    vibrations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, angel number 444 can mean that you need to develop a stronger sense
    of spiritual security *within* yourself. Now is the time to dig deep and find
    the answers to any lingering spiritual questions that plague you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The angels are telling you that you need to develop a strong spiritual foundation.
    This must be a baseline that feels right and true for you, rather than a belief
    system developed by other people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    What feels true? What questions get brought up? You have energetically entered
    into a new chapter in your life and now is the time to figure out what you truly
    believe at your core.

    physical things, caring for your home, etc., but you are neglecting the spiritual
    realm.

    things done in the physical world, but it can *also* aid you in your spiritual
    journey.

    consistently. Dedicate a certain amount of time each day to your spiritual practices,
    whether you do research, practice occult arts, read using your tarot, meditate,
    or simply connect with nature.

    a certain method feels right for you. Remember that angel number 444 is a sign
    *directly* from your angels, telling you that now is the time to take action and
    figure out who you are on a spiritual level.
  prefs: []

    some point. When you are able to visualize a goal, your vision will manifest into

    physical stability and success.

    strong sense of inner security. It’s a sort of practical spirituality, the type
    of practice you do in everyday life instead of the “grand ideas” behind spirituality.

    sense of inner peace we all want inside of us. It shows us that even if things
    go badly in the world around us, we have an innate sense of inner protection that
    no one can take away.
