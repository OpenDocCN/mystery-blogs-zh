- en: Hey everyone hope your having a exciting week!!! And with all the troubles we
    have its important to stay charged with amulets and talisman. I was wondering
    if you all had any witchy ideas for "TALISMAN which is “TOWARDS something such
    as prosperity,love healing, guidance, and so on”. I am quoting this out of a book
    called High Magick bye Damiem Echols! Really good book and he also said that AMULET
    is AWAY! An amulet on the other hand would be used to repel things that hinder
    our growth and development or that no longer searve a purpose in our lives:poverty,
    addiction, conflict, any manufactured drama. I just never tried to do this and
    was wondering if you all could help me because I get the gist of it but just have
    not practiced yet and need a extra push! Its all about the intention right?

    trinkets and want to put them to good use. I think you can use crystals. Thanks
    Tamera for looking out!

    attracting good luck, removing negative energies, bad spirits, preventing psychic
    attacks, anxiety and illness. Amulets are worn by people as a **spiritual mechanism
    of defense** , to act as a shield that blocks evil that surrounds them.'

    a talisman to attract wealth, or a new job, or to improve your relationship. If
    you’re struggling with any particular aspect of your life, whatever it is, you
    can charge a talisman with the frequencies you want to attract and then wear it.'

    I also watch Damien Echols on youtube, he has a way with words! And years of practice.
    Good luck with your talisman!

    from the Greek word [“telos”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos), which means
    end, purpose, or goal.

    or preventing something from happening
