    very traumatic or emotionally charged.

    enough that the events appear to happen on a loop.

    relationship if you force the spirit to activate and then ignore it.

    research before you begin. Some practitioners tend to assume that everything spiritual
    is meant to help them and this is *not* the case. Like humans, Fae Folk can be
    benevolent, evil, or everything in between. Unlike humans, locked doors don’t
    keep them out once you make an enemy.

    are elementals for air, earth, fire, and water. These beings are a *part* of the
    elements but are also tasked with *safeguarding* their element and nature in general.

    contact Hades, so I burned an incense stick as an offering. I also wrote his sigil
    on a slip of paper, activated it, and put it under my pillow.

    with a massive deity during sleep, which is my most vulnerable time. I literally
    invited him into my dreams. Secondly, I should have simply *asked* him if he wanted
    to work with me and waited for a sign. Instead, I forced the issue.

    I literally couldn’t escape it.

    regular offerings to keep the relationship positive.

    have your cleansing and warding down pat. It’s also good to have some pretty strong

    this is a good practice unless you’re working with the much safer ancestral spirits
