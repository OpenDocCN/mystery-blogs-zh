    is not covered with anything, so water will evaporate overtime, thusly particles
    of holy water in your vicinity will create powerful atmosphere of Holy Uncreated
    Energies of God, and bowl works like a true ghost buster marvel! Anything unclean,
    be it spirit or curse or bad energy will be sucked into the water and trapped
    in it! If there is bad influence around you, water will become murky, and that
    is good! do not throw out that murky water yet! let it absorb as much as it can,
    then go some place outdoors dig up small hole in a ground that will not get desecrated
    in any way and pour that water with your new "catch" in it. Ofcourse after that
    you will need to create another bowl, and if water gets murky again, well, just
    be stubborn and repeat process over and over like real ghost buster!

- en: Yes, this can work as a cleansing, but there are also non-Christian options.
    Holy water is simply blessed water. You can bless the water yourself, or leave
    it in the moonlight for the same effect. You do not need to read psalms if you
    are not a Christian Witch, you can say a prayer to your deity, or a generic cleansing
    chant.

  zh: 是的，这可以作为一种净化方法，但也有非基督教的选择。圣水只是被祝福过的水。你可以自己祝福水，或者把它放在月光下以达到同样的效果。如果你不是基督教女巫，你不需要念诗篇，你可以对你的神灵说一段祈祷，或者一个通用的净化咒语。

- en: If I came across that way, I apologize. It was not my intention. This is a working
    cleansing, as I said. I simply wished to provide other options because some witches
    might feel they must cleanse their space with Christian prayers, when they do
    not resonate with that faith. Christianity is valid, as is Christian Witchcraft.

  zh: 如果我的话让你有这种感觉，我很抱歉。这只是一个有效的净化方法，正如我所说的。我只是希望提供其他选择，因为有些女巫可能觉得他们必须用基督教的祈祷来净化他们的空间，而他们与这种信仰不共鸣。基督教是有效的，基督教女巫也是。再次，如果我的评论让你不舒服，我向你道歉。
- en: no no no, everything's fine! I'm just pointing out its not connected to the
    witchcraft, as you can see my other rituals, I explained that it works on whole
    another level, still, it is a way of spirituality, so I guess it has place here.
    that's why I'm here, and that's what I'm offering. As I said I'm sure there are
    tons of other ways of cleansing and protection, I only wish to offer something
    different

  zh: 不不不，一切都好！我只是指出它与巫术没有联系，正如你可以看到我的其他仪式，我解释了它在完全不同的层次上运作，尽管如此，这是一种灵性的方式，所以我想它在这里有它的位置。这就是为什么我在这里，也是我提供的内容。正如我所说，我确信还有很多其他的净化和保护方式，我只是希望提供一些不同的选择。
- en: I am sorry to say, but this would be witchcraft. Witchcraft is a craft, not
    a religion. You are collecting items with a similar energy then channeling an
    energy source for aid with a goal. That is witchcraft. Calling on a deity is not
    necessary to witchcraft, but you can add a spiritual aspect to it. Since you are
    calling on Christian concepts, this would be Christian Witchcraft. It is the same
    as saying Christian knitting, knitting is the craft, Christian is the religion.
    If you do not agree with the term ''witchcraft'' you can call it something else,
    but that is the term. Also, I hope my tone is not combative, I am trying to explain
    witchcraft which can be a little tricky, so I hope I do not come across as argumentative.
    This is your path, you can call it whatever you wish, pray to whomever calls to
    you, and practice in any way that resonates with you. I am simply trying to define
    terms.

  zh: 很抱歉说，但这将是巫术。巫术是一种技艺，而不是一种宗教。你正在收集具有相似能量的物品，然后调动一种能源来帮助达成目标。这就是巫术。祈求神灵并不是进行巫术的必要条件，但你可以为它增加一些精神层面。因为你在呼唤基督教的概念，这将是基督教巫术。这与说基督教编织一样。如果你不同意术语"巫术"，你可以称其为其他名字，但那就是这个术语。此外，希望我的语气不会显得好斗，我试图解释有些棘手的巫术问题，所以希望我不会显得争论。这是你的道路，你可以称呼它任何你希望的名字，祈祷任何你感召的神灵，并以任何与你共鸣的方式实践。我只是试图定义术语。
- en: First of all, forgive my not so good English language, its not my native one.
    As I always say, symbols are only a way of manifesting higher reality, so yes,
    I would not use term ''witch'' for every and any spiritual craft you come upon,
    same with word ''magic'' coming from the Zend Avestan priests aka Magi, so, if
    we are up to the terminlogy, I would much rather use metaphysics which means that
    which comes after physics, and did you know that Aristotel originally wanted to
    call his work theology? Since, when you render this all down to the bare bone,
    it is all differing ways of theology, what I say is that I offer different way
    than witchcraft, but due to lack of basic understanding of metaphysics, one can
    confuse some spiritual practices with lower magical systems, invocations recitations,
    ritualistic behaviour, etc. First thing first is you must understand what lies
    behind, beyond - first thing to understand is what is your own ''I'', your own
    person your own ID, your very own soul? existential questions like that leads
    down the rabbit hole where that wall between You and I vanishes, and I see you
    as my other ''I'' be it incarnation once in an eternity, reincarnation, you are
    just my other ''I'', time itself is a simple construct, non existent, it is not
    a force, so in moment of that realization, that ''God'' is my, yours, ours higher
    ''I'', your higher self is that eternity. There is no higher religion than truth,
    and there is no higher truth than orthodox christianity, where everything and
    everyone gets to keep their own shape, beliefs, their own meaning of life, imbued
    by uncreated energies destined to live for eternity. That energies are called...
    Love. Love begins there, where all laws and rules and definitions and terms end,
    where you can be the one you want, you has and the one you are meant to be. Dont
    get me wrong, Im saying all of this just to clarify what are my beliefs, so you
    understand all of my nonsense, I love all that cozy witchy aesthetics, and believe
    me, I see such deep meaning in all of that which you talk about as a psychologist
    2nd year student of theology and freshman of medical college. personally, Im interested
    in osteopathy neurolinguistics and psychonautics, if you are willing we can talk
    more via private messaging, Im very friendly and always open for discussion!

  zh: 首先，请原谅我的英语不是很好，这不是我的母语。就像我总是说的，符号只是表现更高层次现实的一种方式，所以是的，我不会对你遇到的每一个精神技艺都使用术语“女巫”，同样，来自波斯语《圣经》（Zend
    Avestan）祭司即魔法师的“魔法”一词，如果我们要讲术语，我更愿意使用形而上学，它的意思是超越物理学之后的东西，你知道亚里士多德最初想要称呼他的作品为神学吗？因为当你将这一切归结到最根本的东西时，它其实是各种不同的神学方式，我的意思是，我提供的是与巫术不同的方式，但由于对形而上学基本理解的缺乏，人们可能会把一些精神实践与低级魔法系统混淆，包括召唤、吟颂、仪式行为等等。首要之处是你必须理解背后的东西，超越——首先要理解的是你自己的“我”，你自己的人格，你自己的ID，你自己的灵魂？像那样的存在问题引导你走向兔子洞，那个墙壁，分隔你和我之间的墙壁，它消失了，我将你视为我的另一个“我”，不管是一次化身还是永恒中的转世，你只是我的另一个“我”，时间本身只是一个简单的构想，不存在，它不是一种力量，所以在那个领悟的瞬间，“上帝”就是我的、你的、我们的更高“我”，你的更高自我就是那个永恒。没有比真理更高的宗教，也没有比正统基督教更高的真理，那里每个人和每件事都保留自己的形状、信仰和生命的意义，被未创造的能量充满，注定要永生。那能量被称为……爱。爱从那里开始，那里所有的法律、规则、定义和术语都终结，你可以成为你想成为的人，你有和你命定要成为的人。不要误会，我说这一切只是为了澄清我的信仰，让你理解我的一切胡言乱语，我喜欢所有那些舒适的女巫美学，相信我，作为神学二年级心理学生和医学院新生，我对你谈到的一切都有深刻的理解。就个人而言，我对骨疗、神经语言学和心灵航海很感兴趣，如果你愿意，我们可以通过私信继续交流，我非常友好，随时为讨论开放！

- en: I see your point. I will have to disagree with your belief that Orthodox Christianity
    is the one true path. I personally agree all paths lead to the same divine source.
    I believe my form of Wicca is the right path for me, but that does not mean it
    is the only path or that other people should follow my belief. When I state facts
    or terminology, that is different. 2+2=4 you can believe it is 5, but that is
    wrong. Believing we are all from the same energetic collective and we are all
    linked on a spiritual level I can agree with this.

  zh: 我明白你的观点。我必须不同意你认为东正教基督教是唯一正确的道路。我个人同意所有道路通向同一个神圣的源头。我相信我的女巫教形式对我来说是正确的道路，但这并不意味着它是唯一的道路，或者其他人应该跟随我的信仰。当我陈述事实或术语时，情况是不同的。2+2=4，你可以相信它是5，但那是错误的。相信我们都来自同一个能量集体，并且在精神层面上我们都联系在一起，我可以同意这一点。
