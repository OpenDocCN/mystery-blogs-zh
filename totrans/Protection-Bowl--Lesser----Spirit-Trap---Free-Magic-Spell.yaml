- en: Put that Bowl in front of the icon of the saint, and keep it all safe. Bowl
    is not covered with anything, so water will evaporate overtime, thusly particles
    of holy water in your vicinity will create powerful atmosphere of Holy Uncreated
    Energies of God, and bowl works like a true ghost buster marvel! Anything unclean,
    be it spirit or curse or bad energy will be sucked into the water and trapped
    in it! If there is bad influence around you, water will become murky, and that
    is good! do not throw out that murky water yet! let it absorb as much as it can,
    then go some place outdoors dig up small hole in a ground that will not get desecrated
    in any way and pour that water with your new "catch" in it. Ofcourse after that
    you will need to create another bowl, and if water gets murky again, well, just
    be stubborn and repeat process over and over like real ghost buster!

    all is connected as we both say, and I agree we can disagree and have different

    to not evaporate after two years from a small bowl. This suggestion is medically
    dangerous and could land people in the hospital, if not worse. Avoid this user's
    advice.

    Holy water is simply blessed water. You can bless the water yourself, or leave
    it in the moonlight for the same effect. You do not need to read psalms if you
    are not a Christian Witch, you can say a prayer to your deity, or a generic cleansing
    chant.
  prefs: []

    a purpose, I respect your opinion and also I think there is a lot of other non
    christian options for those who want it that way

    wish to use this, there are ways to alter it to suit your needs. He didn't say
    a single thing against Christianity, Christians, or Christian witches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I came across that way, I apologize. It was not my intention. This is a working
    cleansing, as I said. I simply wished to provide other options because some witches
    might feel they must cleanse their space with Christian prayers, when they do
    not resonate with that faith. Christianity is valid, as is Christian Witchcraft.
    Once again, I apologize if my comment was upsetting to you.

- en: no no no, everything's fine! I'm just pointing out its not connected to the
    witchcraft, as you can see my other rituals, I explained that it works on whole
    another level, still, it is a way of spirituality, so I guess it has place here.
    that's why I'm here, and that's what I'm offering. As I said I'm sure there are
    tons of other ways of cleansing and protection, I only wish to offer something
    different

- en: I am sorry to say, but this would be witchcraft. Witchcraft is a craft, not
    a religion. You are collecting items with a similar energy then channeling an
    energy source for aid with a goal. That is witchcraft. Calling on a deity is not
    necessary to witchcraft, but you can add a spiritual aspect to it. Since you are
    calling on Christian concepts, this would be Christian Witchcraft. It is the same
    as saying Christian knitting, knitting is the craft, Christian is the religion.
    If you do not agree with the term ''witchcraft'' you can call it something else,
    but that is the term. Also, I hope my tone is not combative, I am trying to explain
    witchcraft which can be a little tricky, so I hope I do not come across as argumentative.
    This is your path, you can call it whatever you wish, pray to whomever calls to
    you, and practice in any way that resonates with you. I am simply trying to define
    terms.

- en: First of all, forgive my not so good English language, its not my native one.
    As I always say, symbols are only a way of manifesting higher reality, so yes,
    I would not use term ''witch'' for every and any spiritual craft you come upon,
    same with word ''magic'' coming from the Zend Avestan priests aka Magi, so, if
    we are up to the terminlogy, I would much rather use metaphysics which means that
    which comes after physics, and did you know that Aristotel originally wanted to
    call his work theology? Since, when you render this all down to the bare bone,
    it is all differing ways of theology, what I say is that I offer different way
    than witchcraft, but due to lack of basic understanding of metaphysics, one can
    confuse some spiritual practices with lower magical systems, invocations recitations,
    ritualistic behaviour, etc. First thing first is you must understand what lies
    behind, beyond - first thing to understand is what is your own ''I'', your own
    person your own ID, your very own soul? existential questions like that leads
    down the rabbit hole where that wall between You and I vanishes, and I see you
    as my other ''I'' be it incarnation once in an eternity, reincarnation, you are
    just my other ''I'', time itself is a simple construct, non existent, it is not
    a force, so in moment of that realization, that ''God'' is my, yours, ours higher
    ''I'', your higher self is that eternity. There is no higher religion than truth,
    and there is no higher truth than orthodox christianity, where everything and
    everyone gets to keep their own shape, beliefs, their own meaning of life, imbued
    by uncreated energies destined to live for eternity. That energies are called...
    Love. Love begins there, where all laws and rules and definitions and terms end,
    where you can be the one you want, you has and the one you are meant to be. Dont
    get me wrong, Im saying all of this just to clarify what are my beliefs, so you
    understand all of my nonsense, I love all that cozy witchy aesthetics, and believe
    me, I see such deep meaning in all of that which you talk about as a psychologist
    2nd year student of theology and freshman of medical college. personally, Im interested
    in osteopathy neurolinguistics and psychonautics, if you are willing we can talk
    more via private messaging, Im very friendly and always open for discussion!

    commentaries and discussions are actually good for this community and even wider.
    There has been too much fluff, we need to rekindle the fires
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I see your point. I will have to disagree with your belief that Orthodox Christianity
    is the one true path. I personally agree all paths lead to the same divine source.
    I believe my form of Wicca is the right path for me, but that does not mean it
    is the only path or that other people should follow my belief. When I state facts
    or terminology, that is different. 2+2=4 you can believe it is 5, but that is
    wrong. Believing we are all from the same energetic collective and we are all
    linked on a spiritual level I can agree with this.
