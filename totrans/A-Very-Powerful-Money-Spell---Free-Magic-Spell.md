*   a cloth bag

*   An altar

*   A belief in magic

*   A voice

*   A good memory (to remember the spell without the paper or book you read it off of)

 Take the candles and light them and put them in a circle on your altar. Put the white at the top, and the other colors anywhere. Take your hair (or other thing)and put it in the middle. Take your cloth bag and put it in the middle also. Make sure to remember the spell because you have to concentrate on the candles and not the book or paper you read the spell off of.

Pick your hair up (or other thing)and stare into the green candle and say:

"With this one strand of hair,
I will get wealthy because it's fair,
I invoke the spirits and want to say,
I need money, O I need it today."

The next time you say it, stare at the white candle, then the blue, then the red, then the gold/yellow.

Then after you're done doing that, take the bag and put the strand of hair in it. Then finish off the spell by saying:

"I will be wealthy,
I will be healthy,
With this strand of hair,
I will get my money,
And it will be fair."

Carry the strand of hair with you always. Blessed Be!

What will happen to my hair after this

The strand of hair is a money charm [if you are worried about losing it, I would place it in a tiny jar, envelope, ziplock bag, or other container to carry with you] if you're concern is your hair falling out or turning green or something, nothing will happen to the hair.

The candles are five in all so does it mean I have to do the spell in five days?

You burn the candles simultaneously in a circle on the altar.

Will the candles be lighted before the enchantment or after

Has anyone tried this spell? I know it says it shall be fair. In the past, though, these usually have ''backfire'' of something like a person dies so you get an inheritance, or a car accident happens and you get a settlement

that isn't the spell backfiring. Some spells can work that way. If you didn't specify and asked for a large sum of money, sometimes a spell will take the inheritance route. Hence why most spells include the line ''harm to none'' but you have to consider ''harm'' can include taking a job from someone else. It's best to weigh the options before casting so you're aware of the possible outcomes. [it's equally possible you could get injured and sue someone, but have a permanent injury]

What is this meant to do?
