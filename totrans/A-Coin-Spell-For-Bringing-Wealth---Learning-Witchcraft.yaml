    the spell while the moon is waning. Before making magic, if you take a bath, add

    are going to need to pay all of your debts off, and then an extra amount for a
    special treat. Just don’t ask for the impossible. Take the yellow candle and use
    its flame to light the paper on fire that you wrote the sum of money on. Then
    drop the paper into your fireproof dish. Watch the smoke carrying your wishes
    up to the deity that you have dedicated your altar to.
