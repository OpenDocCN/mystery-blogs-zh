- en: You can believe as much as you want, but belief cannot break natural laws. We
    cannot grow tails magickally, or develop animal ears, etc, as this breaks natural
    laws and alters our genetics, something that magick cannot do. Belief can only
    get you so far, and this spell is beyond what we can achieve.

    how it works on the physical plane. should you accept or ignore our words of wisdom
    is your choice. we're not chasing people down and demanding they conform, we are
    replying to comments, explaining how magick works, and giving alternatives to
    achieving your goal [regarding animal features, you cannot physically, but it's
    possible astrally]

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It still won't work, but you can enchant shampoo by charging energy while holding
    the bottle, letting the energy pool in the shampoo bottle while visualizing/imagining
    your desired outcome and/or chanting [I enchant my salt body scrubs to double
    as a cleansing scrub, as well as say a cleansing chant while in the shower. It's
    called mixing the magickal with the mundane]
