 First Technique
Write a letter to God or any other deity. Use the correct correspondances. Write your petition, then either burn it or save it and keep it hidden. You can write it in chalk, then wash away the chalk.

Second Technique
On a piece of paper, write your desires and draw a picture of it. Give it a specific date and time to manifest. Beg the mother Goddess and father God to make it so.

Third Technique
Every day perform a gesture of manifestation while willing your desire. You can do this by meditating throughout the day. You can create the "triangle of manifestion", formed by touching index and thumbs into the shape of a triangle. You can create another gesture by forming a heart with your hand.
