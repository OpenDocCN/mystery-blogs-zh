- en: Clairvoyance and clairaudience are incredibly popular today, but they’re also
    very specific gifts. Many of us have to work to hone these talents and don’t necessarily
    see or hear spirits naturally. Claircognizant abilities are much more common,
    even though they aren’t as popular.
  prefs: []

    is that this post gives you insight into a psychic ability that you may naturally
    possess!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re claircognizant, you basically **know** things to be true or not true
    without any logical reason. You don’t see, hear, touch, taste, or feel anything
    that alludes to your knowing, but it’s simply there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being claircognizant is difficult because it probably feels like a natural part
    of who you are. You might not realize that you have a psychic gift since it’s
    so hard to separate claircognizant abilities from the logic of your own mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The difference is that claircognizant knowings have no explanation. You might
    later notice the logic or reason of your knowings, but they originate from your
    Higher Self, your spirit guides, etc. and have no basis in your regular life.
    These knowings very clearly don’t come from your own mind.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The major “clairs” (clairvoyance and clairaudience) are relatively easy to understand.
    Both the words and the senses that are used for these psychic abilities are obvious
    to us.
  prefs: []

- en: Claircognizance and clairsentience can be more difficult concepts to grasp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clairsentience, loosely translated, means “clear-feeling.” If you’re clairsentient,
    you find answers and clarity **through your feelings.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with clairsentience can easily derive an answer or have a realization
    through their emotions. To these folks, emotion and logic go hand-in-hand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Claircognizance, on the other hand, means “clear-knowing” loosely translated.
    Feelings and emotions are not involved with claircognizance. If you’re claircognizant,
    you get logical, factual knowings that are in fact quite separated from your emotions.

    this is rare if you haven’t worked to develop them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do find that claircognizance and clairsentience are almost opposite. One usually
    comes before the other. Generally, people will either have the intuitive feeling
    or the intuitive knowing *first.* The second will follow shortly after.

    vision in their dreams, some hear the audio quite clearly, and others even taste
    food or drink.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s very common to experience dreams that are flooded with emotion. After you
    wake from these types of dreams, the details may be fuzzy, but the emotions are
    very sharp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Claircognizant dreams are a bit different than the regular. Emotion may or may
    not be present in the dream or after you wake, but the key is that you experience
    a *factual knowing*. You will probably wake with some bit of knowledge that you
    didn’t have before the dream and you’ll recognize instantly that it’s true.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While these knowings are sometimes accompanied by emotion, the hallmark of a
    claircognizant dream is that the actual piece of enlightenment you gained from
    the dream is factual and exists separate from emotion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    them (even a few times in your lifetime) is a clear mark of claircognizant abilities.

    be quite random or it might be about a problem that you’ve been mulling over.
    Most psychics call this rush a *download* from your spirit guides.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you experience downloads that are factual in nature or give you clear, unemotional
    answers that make logical sense, then you’re probably claircognizant. This is
    one of the biggest signs.

    can be super useful, even in everyday life!

    of a download, although the meaning can be a bit more cryptic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that Deja Vu is often the first signal of psychism in anyone, especially
    if it happens often. If you’re claircognizant, your Deja Vu will have an element
    of *remembering something* rather than remembering feelings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whether you’re actually able to remember it or you can’t remember it (but feel
    like something important is on the tip of your tongue) depends on the person and
    on the level of experience, but it’s the fact that you feel that you *should*
    know something that classifies this type of Deja Vu as claircognizant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason I include Deja Vu here is because it is essentially a download and
    it’s sometimes so fast that you can’t even decipher the meaning. Spirits communicate
    at an *incredibly* rapid energetic pace, so it can be super difficult for human
    beings to understand every communication. Our minds simply don’t work that fast.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I personally feel that Deja Vu is essentially a spirit (or spirit guide) communicating
    to you all at once. The amount of energy that suddenly gathers can have an effect
    on you, therefore you experience a type of out of body “remembering.”

    up lying to you. For some reason, you’re just quite sure of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Claircognizance is knowing without having any of your senses activated expect
    your mind. You might not even need to pick up on the signals that a person is
    lying (although you might store those away in your mind to confirm your theory);
    you just know it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can actually be a bit difficult to be claircognizant because you have no
    solid answer as to *why* you know it. You can explain that you saw it, heard it,
    or felt it psychically, but how do you explain just knowing something that you
    didn’t know a few moments ago? The key is to trust the messages that you receive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might find that your claircognizance kicks into overdrive when you’re around
    people you feel threatened by. These are often insincere people; insincerity is
    something you’re naturally good at spotting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also easily spot people who are genuine. You may feel positive instantly
    towards someone without knowing them. You might just decide that a person is truthful
    without digging. If you’re often right, these are signs of claircognizance.

    you’ll be looking at the regular world and abruptly see a picture in your mind
    that has nothing to do with your surroundings.
  prefs: []

    something that you didn’t know before in the blink of an eye.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are so many types of knowings that can occur for a claircognizant individual.
    For example, you might suddenly realize that you shouldn’t go to a certain outing,
    that your dog doesn’t like their new bed, or that your mother wants you to call
    her. You will get factual knowledge that can be anything from a dire warning to
    a small tidbit of information.
  prefs: []

    times you may get claircognizant messages about other people, animals, plants,
    etc.

    get claircognizant messages about projects I’m working on and these knowings push
    me forward because I suddenly have a clear direction. When I act on these knowings,
    I’m almost always successful.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    then contributes to a knowing. Instead, you receive the knowing first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Claircognizant knowings are factual in nature. A specific knowing might trigger
    an emotional response if it feels personal to you, but this will come *after*
    you receive the knowing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you’re studying [past life astrology](https://teaandrosemary.com/past-life-astrology/)
    in your birth chart, you will get informational facts about your past life rather
    than *feeling* the emotions that the previous “you” felt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason your knowings are factual is because your spirit guides and Higher
    Self are all factual beings. To them, all things that happen simply *are.* When
    you have the claircognizant line of communication, they don’t need to reach you
    through emotion, so they can simply transmit the idea or thought.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with claircognizant abilities are extremely mental. In a way, this is
    psychism of the mind. It’s as if a knowing or idea suddenly sprang from your mind
    (similar to Zeus in Greek Mythology) without you needing to work for it.
