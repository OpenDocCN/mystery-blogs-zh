- en: Clairvoyance and clairaudience are incredibly popular today, but they’re also
    very specific gifts. Many of us have to work to hone these talents and don’t necessarily
    see or hear spirits naturally. Claircognizant abilities are much more common,
    even though they aren’t as popular.

- en: If you’re claircognizant, you basically **know** things to be true or not true
    without any logical reason. You don’t see, hear, touch, taste, or feel anything
    that alludes to your knowing, but it’s simply there.

  zh: 如果你是“明知”，你基本上 **知道** 事情是真的还是假的，而没有任何逻辑的原因。你看不见、听不到、触摸不到、尝不到、感觉不到任何暗示你的了知的东西，但它就是在那里。
- en: Being claircognizant is difficult because it probably feels like a natural part
    of who you are. You might not realize that you have a psychic gift since it’s
    so hard to separate claircognizant abilities from the logic of your own mind.
  id: totrans-10

    later notice the logic or reason of your knowings, but they originate from your
    Higher Self, your spirit guides, etc. and have no basis in your regular life.
    These knowings very clearly don’t come from your own mind.

    Feelings and emotions are not involved with claircognizance. If you’re claircognizant,
    you get logical, factual knowings that are in fact quite separated from your emotions.

    of *remembering something* rather than remembering feelings.
  id: totrans-37

- en: Whether you’re actually able to remember it or you can’t remember it (but feel
    like something important is on the tip of your tongue) depends on the person and
    on the level of experience, but it’s the fact that you feel that you *should*
    know something that classifies this type of Deja Vu as claircognizant.
  id: totrans-38
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason I include Deja Vu here is because it is essentially a download and
    it’s sometimes so fast that you can’t even decipher the meaning. Spirits communicate
    at an *incredibly* rapid energetic pace, so it can be super difficult for human
    beings to understand every communication. Our minds simply don’t work that fast.

- en: I personally feel that Deja Vu is essentially a spirit (or spirit guide) communicating
    to you all at once. The amount of energy that suddenly gathers can have an effect
    on you, therefore you experience a type of out of body “remembering.”
