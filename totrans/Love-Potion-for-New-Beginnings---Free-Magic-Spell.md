**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A handful of fresh cherry blossom

*   1/4 cup of clear spirit (Vodka)

*   1 spoon of sugar

*   1 spoon of salt

*   1 spoon of lemon juice

 Put the spirit in a pan on the cooker. Heat it very gently and stir in the salt and sugar so it has completely dissolved. Wash the cherry blossom and add. Stir very well and gently with a wooden spoon. Keep the heat very low so as just to warm it and not boil. Then add the lemon juice and chant:

"Love light,
Love bright,
Love falls like snow tonight,
Bright petals in the air,
Bright petals everywhere,
I want to dance with love,
I want to take a chance with love,
Love come to me,
Love set me free,
Love teaches me,
To be the lover I can be.
By sun and moon,
And three times three,
This is my will,
So mote it be!"

Turn off the heat and once cooled down, pour it in a nice bottle. The next day, take 3 drops, 3 times for 3 days. Remember to finish the whole course of 3x3x3 or things won't work even if they could.
