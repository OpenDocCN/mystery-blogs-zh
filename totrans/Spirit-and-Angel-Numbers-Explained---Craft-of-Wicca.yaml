- en: The universe needs a way to communicate with us. One of the simplest ways for
    this to happen is through numerology. Numbers are the universal language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people believe angels send us these messages. Other people believe it is
    the Ancient Goddess or Mother Earth herself.

    animal guides to the Japanese with kami. This tells us the phenomenon is real.'

- en: 'The specific messenger isn’t important: it’s all about the message.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The basic principle is that each number has significance. You can figure out
    the meaning of your number by then paying attention to repetition and combinations.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Once you know how to be open to your spiritual number, you should figure it
    out quickly. The number will appear to you with sudden compulsion. This is your
    spirit guide telling you to pay attention: your number is there.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can happen in really clear ways like waking up at 2:22 a.m. and feeling
    compelled to check the clock. But it can happen in more subtle ways, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way mine first appeared to me was during reading. I was completely caught
    up in the novel, transported to another world. There was no reason I should have
    come out of that state of mind, but my eyes randomly drifted to the corner of
    the page.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I lost the moment I was in staring at the page number. Over the next few weeks,
    the number appeared to me several more times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no one way it will happen for you, but hopefully, this will help you
    understand some of the ways it will come up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'My golden rule is this: if you aren’t sure, it probably isn’t it. Stay open,
    and eventually, you’ll get clearer signs. It will usually occur three times in
    a short period of time. So, don’t attribute a single noticing of a number too
    much significance.'

    out longer strings of numbers.

    It usually indicates cooperation.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    It can also indicate excess: three’s a crowd.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Four:** The four elements and four directions. It is the number of balance
    but also of drive and work life.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the self/spirit. It often represents freedom.'

    empathy.'

    realizing your purpose in life.'

- en: Repetition just means the number’s meaning is strengthened. We have a repetition
    of both 1 and 0 but then again of 10.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The number 10 represents both a beginning and the divine. This number takes
    on the meaning of the beginning of a new spiritual path. Maybe you’re considering
    one. Take this sign to dive in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this doesn’t sound right to you, take some time to meditate on it. Listen
    to what your soul is telling you. This number might be a message that you’re on
    the wrong path and need to reevaluate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The triple set of duplication is a strong one. This is not a message to be taken
    lightly.
  prefs: []

- en: '### 222 Spiritual Meaning'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a very strong signal. It is a tripling of the number 2, but it’s also
    a duplicated 22\. In this form, the 2 takes on a slightly different meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The duality of the 2 represents the soul/body. The tripling means this combination
    might be out of balance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are you feeling like your life is a bit off course? Your personal/professional
    duality is a bit off. The thing you do physically or for work doesn’t match your
    spiritual convictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bring these back into alignment by following what your deepest personal convictions
    tell you to do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    as 22 or 2222 or changes altogether.

- en: 'Is this the first time you’re receiving a message from the spirit world? The
    repeating ones is a common first message: it strongly indicates firsts.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can also appear as a way to indicate something new that is going to happen
    or has just happened. Maybe you started a new job or have a new friendship. If
    this is the case, await the next number. It will be about this new beginning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For everyone else, notice where this number appears. What were you doing or
    thinking? This number is the divine wake-up call. The number is appearing to draw
    your attention to it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whatever the number is pointing to, you should take a leap of faith and go ahead
    with it. Were you considering moving or taking a new job? This is the divine telling
    you to do it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s a lot going on with this one. The 1 and the 2 both appear twice, but
    the number 12 appears twice as well. Don’t forget the hidden 6 that appears as
    the sum of these numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The duality of 2 can mean a relationship, friendship, or even your relationship
    with the divine. The 12 means a new one of any of these. It may have just begun,
    but this doubling can mean to enter into one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe you’re on the fence about a new friendship. Give it a chance and some
    time. It will open up into something you weren’t expecting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The hidden 6 could mean your family is a part of this relationship. Did a new
    family member suddenly appear? Give this relationship a chance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The number 1212 is sometimes associated with twin flames, which are believed
    by some to be the other half of one’s soul. According to some beliefs, twin flames
    are meant to be together and are able to communicate telepathically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Seeing the number 1212 is sometimes thought to be a sign that your twin flame
    is thinking of you or that your connection with them is growing stronger.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This contains both the 9 and the 1\. The 1 is doubled but appears after the
    9.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I treat these types of numbers as the first one being the primary topic and
    the doubled one as having more significance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The topic of this message is your true calling. You are in the wrong field,
    and you know it. The doubled ones mean a new beginning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The time is right. You need to make the change now. The doubled ones indicate
    an urgency. You may miss your chance forever if you don’t do it now.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a tripled 8 but also a doubled 88.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stop whatever you’re doing. This is a strong warning message. Are you putting
    out a lot of negative energy? This is going to come back to you threefold, so
    it better be worth it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can also mean being patient. If you’re putting a lot of work into something
    and seeing no reward from it, keep at it. This message is telling you it will
    come back soon. Don’t give up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For everyone, the message is a great reminder to adjust your attitude and spiritual
    practice to be as positive and loving as possible.
