**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Red Ribbons

*   Lemon Juice

*   Flour

*   Milk

*   Bowl

*   Sea Sponge

*   Towel

*   Grave Yard Soil

 In a large bowl: Mix 1 cup of flour into 2 cups of milk. Add one 1/2 cup of lemon juice to mix and stir until smooth. Using a sea sponge, cover yourself with the milk mixture. Chant: “Let this mixture cleanse my skin. Lighten so I may see the new improve me within”. Let the mixture dry completely and then remove with a towel.

Tie a red ribbon tightly around each of your wrists, without cutting off your circulation. Then tie one around your neck. Sit Indian style with your hands pushed together, like your praying. Close your eyes, picture in your mind all your blood, life, and energy is being pushed out through your third eye. Concentrate on pushing it out, until your head tingles and you feel drained.

While removing the ribbons from both wrists and neck, say, “These are my chains to life. I remove thee”. Dig a hole in a safe place, or in a grave yard, and bury the ribbons. Collect soil from the ground. This is your “grave soil”. Sprinkle this on your bed at night and sleep upon it. By next nightfall you shall be a vampire.
