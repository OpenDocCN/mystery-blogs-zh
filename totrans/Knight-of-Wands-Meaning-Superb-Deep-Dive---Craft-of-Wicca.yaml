- en: 'The classical meaning of this card can be seen in the Rider-Waite deck. The
    horse is up and charging. If you want an easy way to remember the meaning classically:
    he’s literally a “knight in shining armor.”'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The upright meaning is one of travel and adventure. Depending on the context,
    it can mean finally taking those steps to make the trip happen or it could mean
    that you’re on the right path and should continue the journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The journey can be physical or metaphorical. This again will probably depend
    on the question or position of the card.

- en: Reversed Knight of Wands Meaning
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most standard reversed meaning is that you are on the wrong path. Notice
    if there are obstacles in your way or people around you are concerned about the
    journey/path/project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about whether these concerns are merited. The reversed meaning often indicates
    stopping the project or journey. Halt before you step into danger. At the very
    least, slow down your progress to figure out why you’ve been interrupted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common reading is not quite this extreme. You may be on the right path,
    but you just need to go around whatever problem you’ve come up against.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To remember this, look at the upside-down card. The knight is being thrown from
    the horse. He just wants to go onward, but he can’t make progress until he gets
    back on.

- en: I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their
    symbolism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s
    good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to
    have a good interpretation of the moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember,
    each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards
    is an art, not a science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll use a different deck for every one of these. Today’s is the Philosopher’s
    Stone Tarot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing that catches my eye is the fire. This type of symbolism should
    be expected considering the Suit of Wands is associated with the element of fire.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wand cards can always take on alternate fire-related meanings. If this came
    up for me, I’d read it as relating to passion or sex or relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In light of the classical interpretation, it says to continue on the current
    relationship path. But since the knight isn’t even standing yet, it is probably
    referring to a relationship you’re considering and hasn’t actually started on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For the reversed reading, I’d take a stronger position: do not embark on this
    seductive new relationship. It’s very tempting, but it will lead to more problems
    than it’s worth in the long run.'

- en: The main type of positioning that complicates the reading is when it is in an
    internal or spiritual position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is because the knight is all about external action, charging in, and bombastic
    behavior. These are the opposite of contemplative or spiritual experiences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this position, I like to read the card **not** as going on a spiritual journey,
    but as a call to action. Step up in your spiritual life and take on a leadership
    role.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re into meditation, start a meditation group. If you’re Wiccan, gather
    a coven together to do a social ritual or spell. The knight indicates bursting
    forward out of your comfort zone.
  prefs: []
