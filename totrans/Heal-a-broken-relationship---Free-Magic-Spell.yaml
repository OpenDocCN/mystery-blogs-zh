    red candle. After you light them meditate and ask that this spell will reach this
    person and mend any hurt feelings and you broken relationship. From there open
    your eyes (if closed) and blow out the candles in the order you light them. Think
    of the good times you've had and visualize an aura/mist of the candle's color
    swirl around that person then seep into them putting forgiven into there heart.

- en: what is the use of Pentacle???
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pentacles are protection symbols, representing the four elements and spirit
    [each point is an element] so I think they chose to include it for protection,
    but you don't seem to need it for the spell to work. If you want to utilize it,
    just draw one on a piece of paper and leave it on your altar, but I don't think
    it's required for the spell.
