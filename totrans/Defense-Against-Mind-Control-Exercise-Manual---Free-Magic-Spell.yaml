    and stare at it for a long time, I'm sure 90% of people under 5 minutes seeing

    thinking or memorizing, so when they see the Hypno spiral for long times the **eye

    all should not using eye muscle when thinking or memorizing, remember **dependencies

    lock the door, my record doing this is only 35 minutes, because this makes my
    mind dizzy, because there is suggestion "the more you resist, more stronger ..

    and again"  (voice speed 1.25) for whole days or tomorrow if I'm not in control

    in The second step, maybe you could succeed with short time 3 days or less, but
    what about the long term? or just for 3 days later? when you got information in
    your mind, it will not control you even though the suggestion is heard or sensed. "feel
    my words go inside your head, flow, flow & flow, so washing your mind away, my
    will is stronger than you, then you got weaker, weaker, weaker...". Why should
    our willpower get weaker? **this is somehow because of acceptance or trust to
    the hypnotist that you give in the first time then you just follow it.** remember
    mind is not attached to the time, if you do this right for only 3 seconds or less,
    you can be just free from controlled trances, if you need a very long time to
    free then your exercise is somehow wrong

- en: the mechanism is the same as when you sleeping, **time in the real world and
    dream world is flowing differently**, even in "waking state" there are people
    who think in 1.1x speed - 1.3x speed (the eye, lips, mouth, face, limbs, body
    movement is same, but only its mind in different speed), that's why you see the
    many scientists, journalist  talk so fast  in a talk show, the mind is, of course,
    a higher frequency than the body, **higher frequency faster it reacts**, remember
    frequency is how many cycles per time, this exercise mastery include mastery of
    time in the mind plane

    watching this will lead to a long-lasting effect maybe 2 weeks (because I meditate),
    maybe more longer for not meditating people **( the effect only occur in some
    trigger, maybe when you see or hear something, it could be in my record 3 times

    from these things, I **repeat empty your mind is not using words empty empty
