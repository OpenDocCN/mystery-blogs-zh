    important to first consider what is your desired outcome, the elements that are
    needed, and the tools that will be used. After you made an assessment of the elements,
    that would make sense for your specific type of spell work, **pick herbs, stones,
    colors, or ritual objects that correspond to the desired elements**. For example,
    if a practitioner is aiming to bring about protection, then they may choose to
    use crystals and herbs associated with Earth, such as moss agate and patchouli.
    If a practitioner is aiming to bring about knowledge and creativity, then they
    may choose to use incense and [herbs](https://www.magickandwitchcraft.com/post/green-witch)
    associated with Air, such as mint and basil.
