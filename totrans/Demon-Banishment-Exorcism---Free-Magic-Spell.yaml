    the spell still work if pronounced incorrectly?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I doubt this actually work but that's more personal opinion. If you don't speak
    Latin and don't know what you're saying it kind of defeats the whole ''have conviction
    in your words'' which the spell insists on. If you ronounce it incorrectly or
    stumble over words the spell won't be as powerful because you had to stop and
    start, or misspoke because, again, you don't speak Latin so you could be ordering
    food for all you know.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In spell casting you must get the pronounciations absolutely correct. In Latin
    simularly spelled words can have very different meanings. You dont want to be
    trying to bannish a demon using the words to order a pizza ya know.

- en: By my understanding, most banishings are prayers. The idea is to ask for benediction
    or authority over a being or place in the name of a higher power. To call on their
    will and authority and to ask for the presence of a higher being (or beings) to
    act through you and sanctify a place, make it sacred, and make any oppositional
    beings unwelcome.

    they aren't nice either. They can be manipulative, you do need to have some knowledge
    of what you're doing because they will exploit those who don't have some footing.
    They're like the fae, some want nothing to do with humans, some don't mind helping
    for a trade, but most are observant and won't seek you out, you'll have to talk
    to them.

- en: Priests can perform exorcisms but it's not exclusive to the catholic church.
    This spell specifically, I doubt how well it works, and if you're not fluent in
    a language like Latin, it's more of a hindrance using it in a spell. I wouldn't
    seek out a demon to attempt this spell, and if you're Christian and dealing with
    demons, contact a priest. But, if you're not Christian and have a demon problem,
    you can still banish them, but this won't do it.

- en: I came close to being possesed once, the lights turned on by themselves and
    when going into the room there was a heavy scense of dread in the air. i started
    to find it hard to breathe and the temprature changed dramatically and when i
    left the room i was touched on the spine but it was as if something went inside
    me from then on i felt as if i was in a trance and all the life was sucked out
    of me making me feel ill and uncomfortable. i found it hard to laugh or speak
    and started to see black spots all around me i could still feel where it went
    inside me like a strong ache all the while there was a stench that went throughout
    the house like corpses or vomit. After that i felt like i was being watched and
    could sometimes see a black figure out of the corner of my eye and occasionaly
    being touched i also started thiinking dark thoughts but i tried to stay positive
    and went to get reiki, the practitioner said they took alot of dark negative energy
    from me that had seemed to attach itself. from then on i used black tourmaline
    and hematite to ward myself however i still see moving shadows occasionally in
    the house i just wish i had that incantation then
