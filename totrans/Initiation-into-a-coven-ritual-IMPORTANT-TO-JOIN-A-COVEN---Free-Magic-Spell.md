This requires an edit due to the spelling and grammar mistakes, it can be a little confusing and an initiation should be clear. Also, while there is nothing wrong with being inspired by movies, using the initiation from The Craft but changing a couple words does not fill me with confidence that it works. I would research a few other coven initiations and should your coven desire to design their own, they can borrow from this which borrowed from The Craft. If you wish to use this one specifically, I do not see any harm, unless someone takes the stabbing part literally. Initiations are to welcome new members into the coven. I would add a part pertaining to oaths and coven secrets since most initiations include all of the rules in the ritual. Honestly, this sounds like the beginning of a ritual. You a just welcome the members. There is nothing else. No meditation, cake and ale, spell craft, ritual prayers or even a farewell blessing. Overall, unless you want to piece together your ritual from several incomplete rituals written by strangers, look for a complete ritual.
