    \ to its lore, bad luck doesn\x92t follow the person who breaks a mirror; rather,\
    \ the negative energy stays focused in the area in which the mirror was broken,\
    \ gradually dissipating over time. Of course, the rules change if you break a\
    \ mirror specifically for the purposes of performing this ritual \x97 that\x92\
    s when misfortune will start following you around. But if you manage to survive\
    \ a night of the worst luck you can imagine, there\x92s gold to be found on the\
    \ other side, a reversal of luck so dramatic that those who have completed it\
    \ successfully claim it\x92s well worth the risk."

- en: "Act I: 1.Begin after sunset, but no less than six hours until dawn. 2.Take\
    \ up your mirror and look your reflection in the eye for three to five seconds,\
    \ focusing your attention on the negative energy held within the mirror. Then\
    \ hold the glass up to your face and anoint it with your breath \x97 that is,\
    \ breathe onto it such that that the mirror fogs up. 3.Repeat this step for as\
    \ many players as there are in the group, with each player performing the step\
    \ in its entirety once. 4.After all players have successfully anointed the mirror\
    \ with their breath, light the candle with your matches or lighter and hold it\
    \ to the mirror\x92s surface. Once the candle has blackened a small portion of\
    \ the glass, remove the candle and extinguish it. 5.Break the mirror, releasing\
    \ the negative energy. 6.Leave the pieces of broken mirror where they are and\
    \ evacuate the area immediately. Act II: 1.Bad luck will proceed to follow you\
    \ throughout the night. Incidents will likely begin small, but will grow in severity\
    \ as the evening wears on. Your survival is dependent on your state of alertness;\
    \ there are no rules to follow or actions to perform that will guarantee your\
    \ safety. The only pieces of advice which may be given are the following: ◾Stay\
    \ vigilant; ◾And should you find yourself in a particularly threatening situation,\
    \ hold your breath for as long as you can. Act III: 1.Should you survive the night\
    \ unscathed, your luck will perform an abrupt about-face with the arrival of the\
    \ first light of dawn: Your bad luck will end, and a streak of good fortune will\
    \ begin. People will be nicer to you; success will come easily; and if you are\
    \ the gambling type, it is recommended that you buy a lottery ticket. Additional\
    \ Notes: ◾Although the only necessary quality for the mirror to possess is that\
    \ it be one that you are willing to break, other qualities may also be worth considering.\
    \ For example: ◾How old is the mirror? Both the risk and the reward of this ritual\
    \ depend on how old the mirror is. An older mirror which has seen many gazes will\
    \ hold more negative energy; accordingly, the strength and duration of your good\
    \ luck during and after Act III will be greater. However, the danger during Act\
    \ II will be greater, as well. Proceed with caution. ◾Do you have a personal connection\
    \ to it? A mirror which has a personal connection to you \x97 one into you which\
    \ you have looked frequently prior to the commencement of the ritual, like one\
    \ from your bedroom or bathroom \x97 will tailor your good fortune to your likes,\
    \ dislikes, and desires. ◾There is no specific location in which this ritual is\
    \ best performed; however, it is NOT recommended that it be conducted at your\
    \ place of residence. It is much easier to run from negative energy if you haven\x92\
    t gone and released it within the walls of your own home. ◾Although this ritual\
    \ may be performed by only one principal, it is best conducted by a group. The\
    \ reason for this recommendation goes back to the idea of there being strength\
    \ in numbers: If only one player performs the ritual, the negative energy released\
    \ during Act I will have only one person to follow. The more players there are,\
    \ the thinner the negative energy will have to spread itself as it tracks you\
    \ down. ◾Anointing the mirror with your breath in Act I connects the negative\
    \ energy within the mirror to you. Holding your breath in the face of the bad\
    \ luck following you during Act II will not prevent it from reaching you entirely,\
    \ but it will buy you a few moments to get out of a dangerous situation if needed.\
    \ ◾You MUST begin the ritual during the window of time indicated in the instructions.\
    \ Beginning too close to dawn will not allow the negative energy brought forth\
    \ from the mirror to fully manifest before the light of the sun purifies it; and\
    \ more dangerously, beginning during the day allows the negative energy released\
    \ by the ritual more time to dog your steps. It is not the light of day that will\
    \ purify the energy \x97 it is specifically the light of dawn. A Final Note: There\
    \ is no way to halt this ritual once it has begun. Do NOT begin it unless you\
    \ plan on finishing it."
