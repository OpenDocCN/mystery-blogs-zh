    \ to its lore, bad luck doesn\x92t follow the person who breaks a mirror; rather,\
    \ the negative energy stays focused in the area in which the mirror was broken,\
    \ gradually dissipating over time. Of course, the rules change if you break a\
    \ mirror specifically for the purposes of performing this ritual \x97 that\x92\
    s when misfortune will start following you around. But if you manage to survive\
    \ a night of the worst luck you can imagine, there\x92s gold to be found on the\
    \ other side, a reversal of luck so dramatic that those who have completed it\
    \ successfully claim it\x92s well worth the risk."

  zh: 黑暗反射仪式大量依赖于使用镜子。但根据它的传说，厄运不会跟随打破镜子的人；相反，负面能量会集中在镜子被打破的区域，随着时间逐渐消散。当然，如果你特意为执行这个仪式而打破镜子，规则就会改变——那时候厄运会开始跟随你。但如果你设法度过一夜中你能想象到的最糟糕的运气，那么在另一面会有黄金，一个运气逆转如此剧烈以至于那些成功完成它的人声称它绝对是值得冒险的。

- en: "Act I: 1.Begin after sunset, but no less than six hours until dawn. 2.Take\
    \ up your mirror and look your reflection in the eye for three to five seconds,\
    \ focusing your attention on the negative energy held within the mirror. Then\
    \ hold the glass up to your face and anoint it with your breath \x97 that is,\
    \ breathe onto it such that that the mirror fogs up. 3.Repeat this step for as\
    \ many players as there are in the group, with each player performing the step\
    \ in its entirety once. 4.After all players have successfully anointed the mirror\
    \ with their breath, light the candle with your matches or lighter and hold it\
    \ to the mirror\x92s surface. Once the candle has blackened a small portion of\
    \ the glass, remove the candle and extinguish it. 5.Break the mirror, releasing\
    \ the negative energy. 6.Leave the pieces of broken mirror where they are and\
    \ evacuate the area immediately. Act II: 1.Bad luck will proceed to follow you\
    \ throughout the night. Incidents will likely begin small, but will grow in severity\
    \ as the evening wears on. Your survival is dependent on your state of alertness;\
    \ there are no rules to follow or actions to perform that will guarantee your\
    \ safety. The only pieces of advice which may be given are the following: ◾Stay\
    \ vigilant; ◾And should you find yourself in a particularly threatening situation,\
    \ hold your breath for as long as you can. Act III: 1.Should you survive the night\
    \ unscathed, your luck will perform an abrupt about-face with the arrival of the\
    \ first light of dawn: Your bad luck will end, and a streak of good fortune will\
    \ begin. People will be nicer to you; success will come easily; and if you are\
    \ the gambling type, it is recommended that you buy a lottery ticket. Additional\
    \ Notes: ◾Although the only necessary quality for the mirror to possess is that\
    \ it be one that you are willing to break, other qualities may also be worth considering.\
    \ For example: ◾How old is the mirror? Both the risk and the reward of this ritual\
    \ depend on how old the mirror is. An older mirror which has seen many gazes will\
    \ hold more negative energy; accordingly, the strength and duration of your good\
    \ luck during and after Act III will be greater. However, the danger during Act\
    \ II will be greater, as well. Proceed with caution. ◾Do you have a personal connection\
    \ to it? A mirror which has a personal connection to you \x97 one into you which\
    \ you have looked frequently prior to the commencement of the ritual, like one\
    \ from your bedroom or bathroom \x97 will tailor your good fortune to your likes,\
    \ dislikes, and desires. ◾There is no specific location in which this ritual is\
    \ best performed; however, it is NOT recommended that it be conducted at your\
    \ place of residence. It is much easier to run from negative energy if you haven\x92\
    t gone and released it within the walls of your own home. ◾Although this ritual\
    \ may be performed by only one principal, it is best conducted by a group. The\
    \ reason for this recommendation goes back to the idea of there being strength\
    \ in numbers: If only one player performs the ritual, the negative energy released\
    \ during Act I will have only one person to follow. The more players there are,\
    \ the thinner the negative energy will have to spread itself as it tracks you\
    \ down. ◾Anointing the mirror with your breath in Act I connects the negative\
    \ energy within the mirror to you. Holding your breath in the face of the bad\
    \ luck following you during Act II will not prevent it from reaching you entirely,\
    \ but it will buy you a few moments to get out of a dangerous situation if needed.\
    \ ◾You MUST begin the ritual during the window of time indicated in the instructions.\
    \ Beginning too close to dawn will not allow the negative energy brought forth\
    \ from the mirror to fully manifest before the light of the sun purifies it; and\
    \ more dangerously, beginning during the day allows the negative energy released\
    \ by the ritual more time to dog your steps. It is not the light of day that will\
    \ purify the energy \x97 it is specifically the light of dawn. A Final Note: There\
    \ is no way to halt this ritual once it has begun. Do NOT begin it unless you\
    \ plan on finishing it."
