# An Inspirational Spell - Learning Witchcraft

This spell uses candles and peppermint oil to help calm your moods and lift your creativity through the roof.

**Here’s what you’ll need:**

2 x tsp almond oil
1 x part peppermint essential oil (or peppermint water)
1 x mixing bottle
1 x indigo candle
1 x white candle

Take the almond oil, and pour it into the mixing bottle. Take three drops of peppermint oil or water, and add that to the mixing bottle as well. Light the white candle, and focus on why you’re casting the spell in the first place.

Once you’ve got a solid idea in your mind, roll the bottle between your hands. Hold your hands prayer style as you do so, charging it with your thoughts and gratitude. Once you’ve got it ready, place it on the altar. Grab the indigo candle and carve the number 1 into it, though as per usual if you have a symbol you feel is more appropriate, use that. Anoint the candle with the oil mixture, return it to the holder, and then light it up.

Declare your intentions, using the following words if it feels appropriate:

*Oh powers that be, I ask of you*
*Send me inspiration*
*Fill my mind and thoughts with clear ideas*
*Remove here now all trace of fear.*

As you watch the candle flame, feel the clarity of thought and inspiration as it burns.
