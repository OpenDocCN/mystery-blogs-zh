    Now take to picture of you and focus on all the details then take a pen and write
    done what you want to see different. Be it hair color or mood change like an opposite
    you if you want. Now if you chose Zen music then that helps to calm the mind.
    No make sure you are completely alone because at your own risk you may unleash
    a deamon that lay dorment within you.

    surrounding you. Only one door is the correct door to what you desire. Open the
    wrong door then I wish you luck with that. No, the door you want is the only one
    that needs a key. Find that door and be ready to open it because what lays in
    chains is that inner you. They will ask do you need me, you answer yes or no.
    If no then you can enter at any time. If yes then you will take their place and
    watch the world through their eyes. If they ask do you want me instead of need
    me then do not answer, turn around and lock the door in behind you. A need and
    a wabt are two different things. Now when the spell is over you will go back to
    normal. It should only last a day, but if it continues then so mote it be.

- en: I fail to see the point. I assume this is a meditation to help you connect with
    your inner self, but it also sounds like a type of possession or way to switch
    places with your subconscious. I see this working as a form of shadow work, not
    as a type of possession.
