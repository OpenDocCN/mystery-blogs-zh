- en: Magic cannot go against the laws of nature. Magic only brings natural change.
    These are well known facts, and anyone who knows anything about real Magic will
    tell you the exact same thing; physical transformation is not possible with real
    Magic. You can call on these spirits and work with them in your craft, but you
    will never become one. You were born human, you will live as a human, and die
    as a human. In your next lifetime you may become a mermaid, a cat, grass, or another
    human, but in this lifetime accept the reality you are human.
