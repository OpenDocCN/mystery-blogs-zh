- en: I have been practicing energy combat with a sword and also without any weapons.
    My master (Sensei) and I have also been making a unofficial combat style where
    you infuse your body with kinetic energy (the energy that is made by moving around)
    to make acrobatic jumps and other almost flying like moves and we have called
    it the Flowing Wind Style.

- en: Oh, kinetic energy, it definitely does not work in that case. My point still
    stands, you cannot use energy to fight like in Naruto, or Dragon Ball, or any
    show that uses someones energy to fight. As for your ''show some respect'' comment,
    I am just stating facts, and respect is not a universal thing. The level of respect
    I give is earned. I do my best to be civil in my responses, but as for my stand
    alone statements, they are just that; statements. Emotionless stating of facts.

- en: The energy used isnt to make tv a reality humans are not meant to hold tge ability
    of flight without something to help aid it the energy used is to simple give a
    boost to some of our natural abilities for example they use the energy gained
    to provied more momentum to their bodies current speed to attempt to a long air
    time durations without intent of trying to fly or something in the non reality
    based shows

- en: Infusing kinetic energy through motion is another way of saying momentum. And
    I can see some of the logic behind the idea of setting the entire body into elaborate
    motion to attempt to increase acceleration and force. There are already martial
    arts styles that have similar philosophies like Tai chi(to a certain extent),
    Capoeira, and taekwondo. Not so mystical, but effective in trained hands. While
    true that the forms of energy aren't magical, the terms are overlapping. (Energy,
    grounding, your root, flow, etc). I can sed how one might mistake one use/interpretation
    for another. That said, there is a lot about energy working that can be learned
    from martial arts, and vice-versa as though the types of energy being dealt with
    differ, the philosophies behind them (focus, discipline, practice, movement and
    flow, etc) relate very well. My advice would be to keep working on your idea,
    and I would suggest drawing philosophies and knowledge from other established
    arts. Worry more about understanding the physics of the human body, and the practical
    philosophies behind combat. Worry less about making it into something mystical
    until you have the physical aspects understood. Then you will have an easier time
    (and stronger knowledge base) to expand into the philosophies and mind spaces
    of tying the art into spirit and meditation.

- en: I very much agree with you. Martial arts can be a spiritual experience, its
    philosophy and wisdom can benefit ones life in many ways. Where my issue lies,
    and where many seem to misinterpret martial arts, is when people think if they
    learn a martial arts style, they can become Goku or Naruto, or some other character
    who uses their chi/ki to fly, shoot energy blasts, multiply and other impossibilities.
    You can connect with your chi/ki and you can gain enlightenment, but when people
    cannot separate entertainment from reality, it can get frustrating repeating yourself
    and people refusing to listen. The definition of insanity I guess haha.

- en: Thats what I meant....In Ki, Qi, or Chi, translation energy of life, it flows
    through all that lives, Energy Combat is just like Tai Chi, and some aspects of
    Kung Fu also use it, its not like Naruto any other T.V series, I don't even know
    where you got that from, since it was never even mentioned in the description...
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just meant the energy that flows through your body, martial art masters....when
    they break a brick or a wooden plank they -Never- use only their muscle.....they
    use the energy and power in and around them and use it to enhance their speed,
    precision and inner power
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't use magick energy to break blocks. It takes practise and skill but
    the wood/bricks are stacked in a way that it's weaker and if you hit its weak
    point, it breaks. [you still need training, so please don't go around hitting
    wood, but it's how they're stacked] many paths do incorporate energy into it [turning
    your opponents energy against them, tai chi following the flow of energy] but
    using energy to fight [for example Naturo since that's usually what people think
    of, but also if you focus your energy into your fist to make you punch harder]
    doesn't really work. Magick energy effects magick energy, it doesn't affect the
    physical in a physical way. You can't supercharge your fists to punch stronger.
    You could work on grounding and meditation to sense energy better and therefore
    sense your opponent, but any super-powered moves aren't real. This specific ''spell''
    [i would call an article] sounds rather fictitious to me, so I doubt it's credibility,
    but if you wish to do energy work while practicing martial arts, it could help.
    Just don't expect to start shooting energy blasts or cloning yourself.
