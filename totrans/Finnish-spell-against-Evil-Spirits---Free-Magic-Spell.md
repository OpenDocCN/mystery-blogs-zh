# Finnish spell against Evil Spirits

I did not write this spell, nor do I have a source. I simply found this in my journal. I assume this is simply read as I didn't mention using any ingredients.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

Nothing

Tvi! Tvi! [translated: Spit! Spit!] evil being!
Tvi! Tvi! evil being of pain!
I conjure you, I conjure you
to the rocking Hell
down into the sucking, slurping well
into the gap of the speckled she-beast
into the angry [here a foul word for a woman's reproductive organs is used] of the serpent
into the [another foul word, think of donkeys] of noble ladies
into the beards of old men
over the trees, and under the cemetery
from Hell you come, to Hell you are going
through the monastery of the Creator
where good people are lifted up
and the evil are pushed down
newly born sheep are brought out.

This requires an edit. There is no Magikal energy behind this, and it does not explain anything. Simply a lot of words. A chant can help to banish, but it would require a plethora of energy to do so. As is, I doubt this works.
