    have in our possession - our body. Another interesting book by established Witchcraft
    author, Laura Tempest Zakroff and published by LLewellyn Books Publishing.*'

- en: '*Anatomy of a Witch* is a very practical book, which focuses on the magical
    potential of our body and emotions. The author covers the magical significance
    of various parts of the body, like the heart, bones or lungs, but also provides
    practical exercises, rituals, activities, and sigils.'

- en: 'The approach of this book is fairly unique compared to the books that you can
    often find on Witchcraft in the book market today. Most literature on Witchcraft
    primarily focuses on the power of the mind or the power of the energy body, but
    rarely connects the two with the physical body. Even though this book isn''t a
    comprehensive map of the energetic centers in the body, the focus is on the 5
    aspects that make up the “essence” of a witch''s body: *The witch''s lungs, the
    witch''s heart, the serpent, the witch''s bones, and the weaver, aka the mind.*'

- en: And, as working with the body naturally starts with having a good relationship
    with it, the book itself is also centers around body positivity, and building
    up a good mental, emotional, and energetic link with your body as well as understanding
    its power and connection to various allegories, and also using the symbolism of
    the Tarot.

- en: My favorite part of the book would be the wide range of practical activities
    offered, which goes beyond what most modern Witchcraft books offer. The book not
    only offers spells, but also various rituals, tips for talisman creation, a usable
    set of sigils, spirit work, and more.

- en: My only small issue with this book was replacing the word "Ritual" with the
    word "Witchual," which I found gimmicky, but apart from the occasional gimmick,
    this book feels like a solid body of serious work that covers a rarely explored
    topic.
