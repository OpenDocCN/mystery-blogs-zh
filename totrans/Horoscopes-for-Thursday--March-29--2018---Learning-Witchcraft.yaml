    life will be a source of great joy, while your professional activities will be
    more challenging than usual. Keep the two areas apart: business and pleasure must
    not be mixed.'

- en: Social contacts are under excellent stars at the moment but one particular relationship
    is going through a difficult phase and today’s Sun-Saturn link will bring matters
    to a head. That’s good. Once you know what the problem is you can easily resolve
    it.

- en: There is no point being pessimistic about life because harmful thought patterns
    make negative outcomes more likely. Shift the focus of your thinking on to matters
    that make you feel good about yourself. There are plenty of them if you care to
    look.

- en: Life is good and about to get even better. Today’s link between Venus, planet
    of values, and Uranus, planet of the unexpected, is sure to bring something good
    your way and be it a person or a possession you will treasure it for years to
    come.

- en: Try not to be too concerned with money matters and business issues. Above all
    resist the urge to make changes that might affect your earning power, even if
    you expect your bank balance to improve in the long-term. Wait and see how things
    develop.

- en: This is a very good time for friendships, so get out and about and meet as many
    new people as you can. A new love relationship is also a possibility, so turn
    on the charm and impress someone who takes your fancy (but don’t lay it on too
    thick).

- en: You must trust your own judgment today because the planets warn if you trust
    what other people say it could cost you dear. You can always find someone to tell
    you what you want to hear but only your inner voice tells you what you need to
    hear.

    persuade you that they know better than what your own brain tells you. The more
    they try to convince you the more likely it is they are aiming to deceive you.

- en: Strive to stay on the good side of people in positions of power today. A Sun-Saturn
    link warns if you fall out with authority figures it is you who will get the worst
    of it, so be smart and don’t say anything that might antagonize them.

    they are, but there is no need to worry about it. Most likely they are cooking
    up a surprise and don’t want to spoil it for you. You’ll find out soon enough.

    aims the easier it will be for them to frustrate them. So don’t give too much
    away today, either in your personal life or at work. Keep the good stuff to yourself.

    know that you’ve had enough of it. Tell them in no uncertain terms to mind their
    own business. And if they don’t? Cut them out of your life completely!

    of year, more than most, issues of a personal nature can at times seem daunting
    but you can always find reasons to laugh if you choose to look for them. So look.
