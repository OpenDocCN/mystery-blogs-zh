- en: For this spell, you will need a fairy door, fairy dust, belief, a notebook or
    paper, a writing tool and your voice. Sit or stand near your fairy door. The door
    doesn’t have to be yours, you can be at a friend or family members house. Have
    a notebook or paper in front of you with a pen or pencil or texta. Have some fairy
    dust with you. Knock twice on the door and write a letter to the fairies. Make
    sure to include in your letter, that you would like to meet a fairy, and to have
    wings. Leave the letter overnight in front of the fairy door. Make sure to sprinkle
    some fairy dust over your letter, to create an extra magical ambience. In the
    morning, hope for a reply. Go over to the door. If there is no reply wait. The
    fairies may not see it the first night. If after a week, the fairies haven’t come,
    knock again. Hopefully, they will come to you. If this spell does not work, please
    comment or, wait until one of your baby teeth fall out. Ask your tooth fairy about
    it. Just make sure that you include in your letter that you would like to be able
    to teleport too.
