    but it is important to remember that not all crystals can be used safely with
    water. Many crystals are not safe to use with water due to their chemical makeup,
    which can cause a reaction when exposed to water. This can lead to dangerous and
    even toxic results.*'

    to do some research beforehand to make sure that your chosen crystals is water
    safe. Some stones, like quartz crystals, are always a good choice, as they're
    water safe and versatile - in general, it can be charged with almost any intention.
    And a majority of the quartz family are water safe, such as smokey quartz, rose
    quartz, jasper, and citrine.

    to water damage. When these crystals come into contact with water, they can react
    by breaking down and releasing their chemical components. The resulting mix can
    be dangerous when ingested, as it may contain heavy metals, toxins, and other
    impurities.

    water. Although these crystals are not as vulnerable to chemical reactions as
    the aforementioned crystals, they can still become weakened and easily break when
    exposed to water. The same applies to certain types of crystals that contain water,
    such as Opal, Turquoise, and Moonstone.

    running water, however, this is not an option with crystals that are not water
