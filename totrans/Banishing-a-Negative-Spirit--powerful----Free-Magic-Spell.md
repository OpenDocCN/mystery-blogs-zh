Lay out one piece of the cotton cloth flat.
Gather the herbs (and everything else, excluding the morning glory stem) and pile them onto the middle of the cloth.
Cast a circle and call to the elements for assistance.
Take the morning glory stem and tie it into a knot, visualizing the negative spirit going into the knot.
Put the stem into the pile.
Light the pile on fire, calling specifically on the elements fire and air.
Chant an incantation (recommended you write your own, so it is personal to you)
Continue the chant until the fire is almost dead.
Sprinkle the earth and water on the pile, calling specifically to the element earth and water.
Call on spirit at this point as well.

As I am aware that the pile might not have burned so well, you have two options from here:

1\. If the pile burned either to ashes or close, take the ashes and seal them in a container.
The first chance you get, scatter them.

2\. If the pile didn't burn well, take the second cotton cloth and put whatever remains of the original pile into that.
Gather the edges of the cloth and tie them together using both the black and lavender strings to create a sort of pouch
The first chance you get, get rid of it, whether in a bonfire, burying it, etc.
