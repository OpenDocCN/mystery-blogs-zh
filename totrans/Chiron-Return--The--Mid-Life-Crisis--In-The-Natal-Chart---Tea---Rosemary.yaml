- en: In astrological communities, the Chiron return is known as the classic “mid-life”
    crisis, occurring around the ages of 46-53\. However, the Chiron return can *also*
    be a time of intense healing.

    from our past that we don’t understand, providing us with an opportunity to release
    this pain and reclaim our power.

    profound manner. As we search for answers, our true purpose and calling become
    more apparent, yet this can also be a time of immense confusion and pain. It’s
    often the case that these periods coincide with the Chiron return in the astrological
    chart.

    wholeness and individuation, you will experience this differently than someone
    who has *not* done the work. In addition, Chiron’s return will be affected by
    any other transits to your chart at the time.

- en: Our long-standing wounds and unresolved issues can be reopened by the Chiron
    Return. If we are unable to address the tortured calls arising from our fragmented
    consciousness, we fall into crisis, or if we retreat even deeper, engaging in
    fight or flight to escape the pain of Chiron. But if we’ve done some work then
    we can use the Chiron return to transform our lives.

    out what *is* important long-term versus what is not.

    sign/house/aspects will become apparent. This is a time of intense transformation
    that can be good *or* bad for your evolution, depending on what you choose to
    do with your Chiron return.

    past decisions. So if you’ve made decisions in the past that didn’t serve you,
    that was made from a place of woundedness, to protect yourself, you will now have
    to look out at the fallout of these decisions. That’s why the Chiron return is
    often called the midlife crisis: people who made the decision to marry, work,
    have children, etc. because they felt inadequate or insecure are now faced with
    the fact that those decisions never really healed their wounds.'

- en: Another possibility is that you could feel fulfilled, like you’ve found yourself
    or your true calling. Usually, this can occur during the Chiron return if you’ve
    already done a lot of work on your Chiron. This period will indicate that you’re
    at the ultimate stage of Chiron healing, letting go of the *fear* and *inadequacy*
    of your shadow self and embracing who you are, becoming one integrated being.
    If this fits, then your Chiron return will also be a time where your own power
    grows immensely because you become who you truly *are.*

    response indicates that you’re living in a victim mentality and don’t see the
    *power* you have to create your own reality. You’re still blaming others for your
    failures and for your own decisions. After all, your Chiron return is just the
    culmination of the reality that you have manifested over the last 50 years.

    that you must *change* something. And this isn’t necessarily something drastic,
    as many people try to do during the Chiron return, but is often a change that
    comes from *within*.

    This is a time when you’re forced to see your reality clearly, to see where you
    still feel inadequate, insecure, hurt, and wounded, and this makes you want to
    make extreme changes.

    a new part of the world, or quitting their jobs. And I’m not saying these changes
    are wrong. But I *am* saying that these changes are often born out of extreme
    reactions to try and *escape* the pain.
  prefs: []

    These changes might make you feel better temporarily, but the Chironic wound will
    always exist underneath. And if the Chiron return is your chance to deal with
    this pain once and for all, why not take it?

    a future free from the burdens of the past. Additionally, you may have to allow
    your hopes and dreams to change, or let them morph into something else that reflects
    who you are now. The only way to come out of the Chiron return is to go *through* it.

    of what to do next. It is imperative that you get out of your own way so the path
    can unfold in its own time. You are being guided by the planet Chiron to slow
    down and go within so you can listen to what your soul or higher self is telling
    you to do. **This is a time to surrender yourself to life and make peace with
    yourself.**

    won’t truly heal you. And if you’ve already gone through your Chiron return and
    made massive changes, don’t worry: it’s *never* too late to do the inner work.
    This is the way to truly manifest the life you want; your power comes from inside.'

    hybrids, we can see the significance of synchronicity and the sacred wounds we
    carry. Cronus (also known as Saturn) is said to be his father in one myth. As
    a result, he gained civilized skills and talents from Artemis and Apollo. His
    students included several Greek mythological heroes, including Heracles.

    attacked a pack of centaurs and killed some. Many of the arrows he shot during

    influence on our charts and the planets it aspects gives us a sense of being wounded
    and unable to heal the wound. While this is not true, it is the *feeling* that
    Chiron gives.

    Chiron. So Chiron indirectly wounds himself. This is, of course, a metaphor for
    Chiron in astrology: our Chironic wounds form because we *believe *the lies that
    live behind them. We attribute *meaning* to the events that form Chiron, meaning
    that tells us we’re inadequate or bad.'

    return is one of the most prominent times to do so. So remember that neither fight
    nor flight will truly heal Chiron. If the lie that created the wound comes from
    within, then healing must come from the same place.
