  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Brighid is an ancient [Celtic Goddess](https://craftofwicca.com/celtic-wicca-overview-of-irish-witches/).
    She is commonly associated with poetry, arts in general, and the arrival of spring.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As such, the most common time to perform Brighid invocations or offerings is
    during Imbolc (February 1, 2020), the festival for the beginning of Spring. Imbolc
    is even known as St. Brigid’s Day in some parts of the world.

- en: 'Brighid is a perfect goddess for Wicca because she has a triple aspect. She
    had two sisters, also named Brighid and she also represents three fundamental
    skills: poetry, healing, and crafting.'

    Hearth Goddess of Ireland or even Brigid, Bright Goddess of the Gael.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like most Irish Gaelic, there are multiple spellings of Brighid. This is because
    Irish went through many transformations like English (Old English looks like German).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may see Brighid spelled as Brigit, Brigid, or even Bríd/ Bríg. I’ll probably
    switch over to Brigit sometimes in this article depending on how it is usually
    spelled in a given context.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Goddess invocation can be used at a variety of times. Brigid is most often associated
    with creativity, so invoking Brigid helps with creative tasks and enhances magic
    about creativity. The invocation can also be used to start Imbolc festivities
    and rituals.

    rushes, but this isn’t strictly necessary. You can use any tall grass or even
    straw or hay if you have it.

    one, like a brass pendant. I will say that if you make this in preparation for
    the invocation, it can put you in a nice meditative state for better results.

    ceremony. This is the symbolic representation of the mind.
