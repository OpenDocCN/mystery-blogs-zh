does this bring u back as your current age or when u were alive

Can you like show me how to draw it or show me what it looks like

Can you make one that can pass time by more than just a day

You are not causing time to speed, you are tricking your brain. Magic does not speed or slow time.

How do you know? It's working for me! So, actually it does work and we are not tricking our brain. Magic can speed or slow time if you actually put effort into it and you are a very good witch!!

All you are doing is changing your perception of time. If you pick a time in the future, and then wait a while, that time didn't arrive because of a spell. The time came because you waited for it to arrive.

As Tadashi said, you're not changing how time is moving [like casting a spell and suddenly it's 2 hours later] but how you perceive time. You know the saying ''Time flies when you're having fun?'' Time isn't literally going by faster, you aren't noticing time and are in the moment. So 2 hours feels like 2 minutes. If this spell works, it would work by making you be more present and not notice the passage of time [I use these types of spells all the time to get through work]
