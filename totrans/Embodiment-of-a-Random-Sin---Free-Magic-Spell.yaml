- en: On the sixth day/night, you should notice that there is a ring of colour around
    your wrist and the symbols of a sin should be on your hand (small but big enough
    to read) in the same colour as that band on your wrist. That is the proof you
    are the human embodiment of that sin. You will be bound to a demon whom - if it
    wants, and if it deems the time is right - may talk to you, somehow.

    perished, will serve them in the next life... but that's just my opinion, others
    may view it differently.

    however, you will not gain any special powers, nor will symbols randomly appear
    on your body.

- en: Items in the spell or sins? Items depend on the spell. Items enhance spells
    and help by charging specific energy. You can technically charge energy and use
    no items, but it would be very difficult and run a higher risk of failing [especially
    if you want a big goal] If you mean sin, it's a human [Christian] construct not
    everyone believes in. Yes, it's wise to come to terms with your personal ''sin''
    and grow, but they aren't universal things everyone has. If memory serves, the
    concept of the seven deadly sins was created in the dark ages by chirstian monks.
