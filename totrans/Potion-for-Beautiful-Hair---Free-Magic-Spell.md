 When to do this ritual: On the Hag's Hare Moon, during the Venus hour.

The "hag's hare moon" is the full moon of March (the season of wildness, the moment of flowering, the time of renewal). If you don't want to wait until March, simply do the spell on a Friday, the day dedicated to Venus, during the waxing moon (closer to the full moon is better.)

Bend over at the waist and brush your hair upside down for one hundred strokes, making sure the scalp is stimulated and all residues of styling aids are gone. Anoint the candle with the oil. Light the candle and the incense. Place the lemon juice, flaxseed oil, egg, maidenhair and ginseng in the mortar, and grind with the pestle until the potion is gooey.

During the Venus hour (or on a Friday, the day dedicated to Venus), recite the incantation over the potion. Incantation:

"Potion of witches with beautiful hair,
Adorn my head beyond compare.
Rich and thick the potion goes,
Absorb the sunshine and the glow.
Maidens weave the gorgeous threads,
That creates the hair upon my head.
Combine the the egg, magick, and grain,
And rise me beautiful with iris rain.
So mote it be"

Work the potion into your hair until it is saturated. Place the plastic wrap over your hair and let it sit. Go outside and soak up the sun. Feel the potion tingling and revitalizing your hair. After a hour in the sun, shampoo and condition your hair, but before your final rinse of the conditioner thoroughly rinse your head in the rain water. Allow your hair to air dry naturally. You will see a improvement in your hair instantly.
