## Casting Instructions for 'Forgive Yourself Spell Jar'

 **Preface:** I had a horrible falling out with my ex girlfriend, and I thought of her every single day.  Everything reminded me of her somehow, and I found myself extremely depressed.  However, I wrote this spell to do when I was feeling down, and it helped me to forgive myself rather quickly.  This spell jar is small, but I found helps me when I need it.

**Spell:** This spell works best when performed under the new moon (see the ingredient meanings below).

*   Place all of your crystals in front of you (if you choose to use crystals) at your altar/workstation.
*   Light the candles* and sit in a chair/on your knees in front of your altar/workstation.
*   Think about the event.  It might be hard, but the best way to get over a hurdle is to jump over it.
*   Meditate into the flame of the white candle.  You can think about nothing or the event, but make sure you know your intent is clear: to forgive yourself.
*   When you are ready, chant once:

> Rhiannon, Cernunnos**, I hope you can hear my pleas.
> 
> I have forsaken myself and done something to somebody (something) that I cannot forgive myself for.
> 
> I know I was wrong, and I know I have wronged you.
> 
> Please help me overcome this obstacle in my life and settle this for not only myself, but the other person (people) involved*** in this situation.

*   Pick up your small trinket and hold it in your hands.  Meditate until you are ready.
*   Chant once:

> This object is one that brings back memories of the other person (people) involved.
> 
> It brings me great pain, but I bring it to you as my offering in hopes you will help me.
> 
> You are great to me. Thank you for accepting me, and thank you for helping me to resolve this.
> 
> So mote it be.

*   Place your herbs and the item into the jar and tie your light blue ribbon around it.
*   Place the jar on a shelf or somewhere it cannot be knocked down.  Whenever you feel like you need to, hold the jar in your hands.

I recommend writing this spell in a journal if it worked for you, as well as any other spell you may do, as well as how well it worked for **you**.  This is a great way not only to keep track of spells you can do in the future, but will also be a great learning experience.  Blessed be, and I wish you a safe journey whether you're still in or even out of the broom closet.

*Note: They should be in candle holders respectively!  **Always** be safe around an open flame.  To ensure safety around candles, please see the National Candle Association's website: https://candles.org/fire-safety-candles/read-the-label/

**Note: This god and goddess can be of your own.

***Note: You may state their name(s) in place of **the other person (people) involved**.

**Ingredient Meanings:**

*   **White Candle:** Represents purity, spirituality, and peace. In some cultures it is the color of death and mourning. In this spell particularly, the white candle will represent peace.
*   **Pink Candle:** Represents romantic love, affection, and friendship.  In this spell, it stands for the romance/friendship you have lost or strained.
*   **Brown Candle:** Used for feeling of self esteem.
*   **Royal Blue Candle:** Promotes laughter, happiness and loyalty, use whenever an influence needs to be increased.
*   **Small Trinket That Reminds You of the Person/Thing You Hurt:** Whenever you need the spell jar, this makes you face the situation.
*   **New Moon:** The dark of the moon, when the moon is invisible, is the most affective for casting spells concerning New Beginnings, and the launch of new projects. It is generally a time for taking new paths and making fresh plans established on the basis of past experiences.
*   **Agate (Optional):** Tones and strengthens both mind and body. Imparts a sense of strength and courage. Facilitates ability to discern truth and accept circumstances.
*   **Amazonite (Optional):** A variety of feldspar. Soothes nervous system. Strengthens heart and physical body. Aids alignment of mental and etheric body. Brings joy and upliftment. Creative expression. Facilitates clearer vision of one's own harmful tendencies, making them easier to release.
*   **Green Calcite (Optional): **In addition to generic attributes it is a great mental healer dissolving old programs and beliefs and restoring balance to the mind. Aids in letting go of the old and the transition from a stagnant to a positive situation.
*   **Light Blue Ribbon: **Light blue is associated with magic related to healing, patience, and understanding. Tie this ribbon around the jar when done.
*   **Jar:** Well, to put everything in.  It's a spell jar.

**Closing Note:** There are some amazing references for new witches both in and out of Spells of Magic.  I used these references while both learning and even now for when I need a recipe or two:
