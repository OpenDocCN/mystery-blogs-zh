**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   rose petals:some

*   water:1 cup

*   apple cider vinegar(optinal)

*   pot

*   something to heat the pot

*   something to drain it into, and with

First pore the water into the pot.
Next add the rest of the ingredients. (this is not necessary but I prefer to put a lid on it)
Once it has boiled down to half a cup, before you put it into anything, say this spell

''I intend for this to banish sadness and bring happiness, love, and light. So mote it be, Blessed be''

(I'm not to sure why I said ''so mote it be'' and ''blessed be'' but I did and it worked so)

After you've said the spell, drain it anyway you like,of course this isn't necessary but if you are going to put this in a bottle and save it for a lil while you might want to drain it and add a bit of apple cider vinegar to preserve and prevent mold

Side affects include: Becoming sexually aroused.
This has to do with the rose petals, if you'd like to leave them out go ahead, I'm not sure if this would prevent the side affects but its worth a try.
