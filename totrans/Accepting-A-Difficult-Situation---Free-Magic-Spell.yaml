    exact situation you wish to be able to move on from. Think of your emotions during
    that time and anything you felt physically, whether it be pain or pleasure related.
    Keep these memories in the front of your mind when saying the spell.

    travel to my memories of a harsher time. This event will no longer be the anchor
    attached to my life, nor the pain similar to which is caused by a knife. Acceptance
    is in my soul and let forgiveness take its toll. By the power of three times three,
    so mote it be."
