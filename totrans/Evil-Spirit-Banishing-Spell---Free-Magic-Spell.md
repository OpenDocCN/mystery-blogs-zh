Enchant this before you write it on a cloth:

''My power, I call to thee
All spirits should all flee

Spirits that rebound this spell
will be bind in the gates of hell.

By the power of this old oath
vanish that all who spoke.

In full moon's eve
all the spirits will be deceive.

By the power of water that flows
powers of the others will be caused low.

I bound my power unto this tree
This is my will, so mote it be.''

After you've done enchanting this and write this on a cloth.
Put the cloth under the tree (I suggest you must bury it besides or near the tree).
