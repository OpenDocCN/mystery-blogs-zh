- honey
- ground cinnamon
- flower petals (preferably rose)
- any or as many of the following: apple peel or apple seeds, barley, basil, catnip, chamomile, clover, cumin, dill, jasmine, juniper, lavender, lemon peel gratings, licorice, maple, marjoram, orange peel gratings, peppermint, poppy seeds, rosemary

Layer the items / ingredients as you wish while focusing on drawing love into your life. Think about the type of partner you would like to have (the traits you would most like them to have).

Charge it by a red, pink, or white candle for a few minutes to a half an hour, still meditating on the love youd like in your life.

Set the container somewhere you can see it everyday, or carry it with you if its in a small enough vial.
