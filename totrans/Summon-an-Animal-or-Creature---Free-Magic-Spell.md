# Summon an Animal or Creature

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This spell really works 99% and I know this because I summoned a water wolf and it worked.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Crayons/markers

*   Paper

*   A pen

## Casting Instructions for 'Summon an Animal or Creature'

 Read the following before you get started.

Draw what your animal will look like. Color your animal according to its element or just color your animal then find out its element by its color. Draw you next to your animal. The animal will be that much taller/ smaller than you.

Write down your height next to you. Color yourself (optional). Make lines to the top of your body according to your height. (example: five feet. Draw five equal lines.) Now continue to make your animal's height. The top of the animal' shoulders are its height. Not the head. Underline the heights of you and your animal.

Fold paper hamburger style. So you can't see your drawing. Fold it only once Now write its info with a pencil on either side. (Name, fur color, wings, tail, Accessories, strength, behavior, abilities, element, elements breed, eyes, what it eats, etc.)

Fold paper hamburger style again so you can't see the words. Now write this and say it as you write it allowed: "(its element) (creature) of mine, come to me, by egg of (its element again). I summon the newborn mythical creature. So mote it be. ("So mote it be" should be written as big as you can.)"

Now fold it hamburger style so you can't see the words. Make a pentagram on one side. Fold it once more. Now every night for three nights, before you sleep, chant: "God/ Goddesses, grant my dream (creature) in the real world from egg to end". Then, chant:" (its element) (creature) of mine, come to me, by egg of (its element again). I summon the newborn mythical creature. So mote it be."

Kiss the paper after you chanted and put it under your pillow. As you fall asleep, dream of you and your animal coming together. If you stop in the middle, just simply read what you have. You need actual belief in magic or else you will not get an egg.

Type of eggs:

*   Water= sitting in the pool (if you have one)/blue egg
*   Earth=rock egg
*   Fire= flaming egg/ red egg
*   Air/Wind= maybe invisible and strong wind comes/ white egg
*   Snow= comes in winter time/white-blue coloring
*   Metal= metal egg
*   Silver= silver egg
*   Copper= copper egg
*   Nature= colorful (I'm not sure)
*   Shadow/dark= black egg
*   Ghost= phasing egg
*   Lightning= sparks of lightning strike
*   Aurora= colorful egg

Hi, I am thinking about trying this spell but I didint see how to get the egg to hatch once you have it?

You can't summon physical animals.

What do you mean?

Magick cannot create a living being out of nothing, you won't be able to cast a spell and have a living breathing creature in an egg appear before you, that isn't how it works.

Magick is not something to give something a life. Magick cannot just make an egg appear then make something breathe and live a life.

If the animal is a mammal I dont think this spell would work cause Mammals dont come from eggs
