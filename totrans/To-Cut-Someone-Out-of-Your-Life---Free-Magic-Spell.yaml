    the arms, and the legs. On one shape, write your name (or the name of the person
    you're doing the spell for), and on the second shape, write the name of the person
    you want out of your life. Light the candle.

    Take the sheet with the toxic person's name on it and burn it, symbolizing the
    relationship disintegrating. Throw out the ashes, thank your deities/guides if
    that is a part of your practice, and close however your practice says to.
