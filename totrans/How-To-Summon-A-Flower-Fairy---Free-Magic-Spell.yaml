- en: '**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following
    items for this spell:** Finding a fairy glen in springtime or summer is quite
    easy. Just go into the county or a park and look for the place where the wild
    flowers grow. Fairies love flowers and they care for them the way a gardener looks
    after their garden. An ideal fairy glen will be lightly wooded with some shelter
    from the sun. A narrow valley with a tinkling silver stream is the very best place
    to seek the fairy folk. But look more with your heart than with your eyes.'

    singing to you. It is a soft, soft song of love. You will know the fairies are
    around when you feel that the fields, the birds, the trees and the flowers are
    all as one. Then you may see them. Dancing circles in the sunlit pastures as the
    buttercups bend in the gentle summer breeze.

    Be at peace with yourself and think joyful thoughts. Fairies like happy people
    and you are such a person. So tell them so. Here is a little verse that I know
    all fairies will like.

    not like liars. But if it is true then try it. You may not actually see a fairy
    but they will know about you and your happy thoughts. Just watch and see how many
    good things start to happen once you have introduced yourself the fairy folk.

    out of the way, spaces. Do not walk through their space, sit a foot away and meditate,
    leave an offering of honey, milk, saffron, or simple candies. If they wish to
    interact with you they will make themselves known, if you get a ''go away'' sign,
    do not argue, and leave. Above all, if you see a fairy ring NEVER step in it,
    avoid at all cost if you do not wish to anger the fae.
