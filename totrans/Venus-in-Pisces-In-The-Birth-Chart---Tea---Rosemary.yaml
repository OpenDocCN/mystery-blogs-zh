    and talented actors, musicians, and artists have this placement, but it also comes
    with a whole host of problems.
  prefs: []

    and uncertain. In the sign of Venus, this is especially hard. With Venus in Pisces,
    you may never know exactly what’s going on in your love life.

- en: At first, those with Venus in Pisces might have trouble understanding money
    because they live in an almost mythical realm inside their heads. Until they’re
    hit with the hard realities, they might focus on their dreams or pleasures more
    than on earning an income.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Venus in Pisces, you might believe that feelings and relationships are
    more important than money. This can manifest positively or negatively. You are
    probably *very* financially generous when you do care about someone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Venus in Pisces usually have *something* that feels gentle and dreamy
    about their looks. Many people with this placement have romantic eyes or a mysterious
    gaze, while others dress in sweet clothing (soft colors, flower patterns, etc.)
    or even just have a really soft energy.

    I personally know quite a few people with Venus in Pisces who work in scientific
    fields but still have a vibrant creative streak and appreciate the arts in some
    manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also be drawn to the occult, to gothic time periods, or to learning
    more about what’s “out there.” You like the big questions as well as anything
    mysterious or mystical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Venus in Pisces, you enjoy shows, movies, books, or other things that you
    can get lost in. Most people with this placement love learning about alternate
    worlds in fiction; they generally like having an escape from real life through
    fairy-tales. Often, these folks are nostalgic for another age or time period.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much of your pleasure comes from dreaming about and planning the future. You
    love to daydream and might yearn to skip ahead to the good part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    one day and hate it the next, but just as quickly pick up a new obsession. This
    placement is a bit changeable.
  prefs: []

    considerate towards others but you can quickly take on too many emotion burdens
    and get bogged down. This can cause difficulties both physically and emotionally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You care for others and simply want to be cherished by friends and family in
    return. You have a lot of room for error on the part of others, but if you feel
    like this care isn’t returned over time, you will eventually be emotionally drained.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

- en: If you have Venus in Pisces, you have a tendency to be attracted to someone
    who needs help or who comes with a few issues. You love the underdog! This can
    manifest as attraction to someone with past trauma or security issues, or can
    show up as interest in someone with alcohol or drug addictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Venus in Pisces like romance and tenderness. They’re attracted to
    the feelings that someone brings out in them, not just physical aspects of the
    other person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    at the same time. They’re a funny mix of odd and romantic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a sensitive, feminine aura. They have a soft and sensitive allure that energetically
    draws others in.

- en: For a Venus in Pisces person, love is a mystical experience. If you have this
    placement, you might feel like things are always changing in your relationships,
    even your own mind. The feeling of falling in love is unlike anything else for
    you. At the same time, nothing feels stable, so it can be difficult to discern
    the truth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You easily miss red flags and tend to fall in love at first sight, but often
    you’re holding onto the *idea* of love without really knowing the other person.
    It’s extremely easy for a Venus in Pisces to fall fast because they look through
    rose colored glasses; it’s also easy for them to get hurt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may tell little white lies when you first meet someone, but this is because
    you want them to like you. A deep desire within you is to be accepted, however
    this manifests. You might take on the energy of whatever you feel your partner
    wants instead of showing your true self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s easy for you to become addicted to intimacy and to go to any lengths to
    regain it in a relationship when it is lost. Sometimes, a person with Venus in
    Pisces holds onto a bad relationship too long, but there always needs to be mutual
    respect for it to last *forever*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have very high expectations for a relationship. You can be deeply hurt easily,
    but you can also forgive almost anything with enough time and effort. Your feelings
    (especially your gut instincts) are really important to you, so you can’t truly
    forgive until a situation *feels* resolved; your emotions may take more time to
    catch up to your thoughts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sexually, people with Venus in Pisces can get so caught up creating a passionate
    fantasy in their mind that it’s hard for them to enjoy anything physically when
    the moment comes. They tend to get stuck in their heads. They’re very sexual in
    their thoughts, but may have trouble acting out their fantasies (which are often
    grand and detailed).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Venus in Pisces can be difficult for their partners to understand
    because they’re so changeable. They want a specific kind of romance one day but
    the next day they’re onto a new idea or obsession and don’t have space for romance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a relationship, those with Venus in Pisces can sometimes discover that they
    don’t actually love the other person, but are in love with the *idea* of their
    partner. This is a selfish aspect of the placement, even though these folks can
    also be extremely unselfish with people they care for. There is almost no in-between.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be tough to understand a Venus in Pisces when they don’t completely understand
    themselves, but at the end of the day, they just want to *feel* understood and
    want a deep, spiritual connection. Someone with Venus in Pisces is always wanting
    to be *known and seen* by a partner.

    Venus shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it
    does for someone with more feminine energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I recommend reading the description of each energy for Venus in Pisces (below)
    and choosing what resonates with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, in a woman (or someone with feminine energy), Venus will show how
    the person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person
    is flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Venus in Pisces. These
    Piscean qualities will show up directly in the personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a man (or someone with masculine energy), Venus will show what kind of qualities
    they are *attracted to*. How this person will *act* depends on their Mars sign,
    but their Venus sign dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a
    partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we evolve and change and the gender lines blur, these distinctions become
    less absolute. For example, I find that *most* women will show a lot of the qualities
    of their Venus when they’re flirting, but a few of their Mars qualities will bleed
    through also.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to learn about both Venus and Mars. Each person has a unique
    combination of both qualities, although this combination may be swayed slightly
    depending on the person’s gender.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, a man who is ultra-comfortable with his sexuality will display many
    more of his Venus qualities, while a man who struggles with his sexuality probably
    won’t “own” these Venusian qualities, so he will instead look for them in a female
    partner.

    are fragile, delicate, gentle, and sensitive. Sometimes, the Venus in Pisces man
    is attracted to someone who needs him or relies on him. It can be easy for this
    guy to end up in slightly codependent relationships.
  prefs: []

    Hidden depth is appealing interesting to him and will make him want to get to
    know the person on a deeper level.
  prefs: []

    they prefer their partners gentle. They want someone a little mystical to appeal
    to those dreamy parts inside them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Venus in Pisces man is usually an initiator, at least at first, so he’s attracted
    to women who give him a chance to properly initiate instead of doing it themselves.
    He tends to get in very deep very quickly with a new partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The difficulty for a Venus in Pisces man comes after he has been in a relationship
    for a while. He tends dive in headfirst, but at some point, the mystery will disappear
    as he gets to know who his partner really is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too much turmoil can cause the Venus in Pisces man to withdraw from a relationship
    either emotionally, physically, or both. He can’t stand emotional turmoil. He
    picks up on his partner’s energy very easy and negative feelings influence him
    over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus in Pisces man can have difficulty with boundaries. Venus in Pisces
    is such a floaty, romantic sign that it’s very hard for him to find clarity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He may also have a fear of his partner leaving him once he has opened up. The
    Venus in Pisces man is sensitive and vulnerable inside, and once he shows this
    to someone it’s hard for him to come back from.
  prefs: []

    even if she doesn’t know the person well. In the beginning, she’s usually on your
    side right away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These women don’t usually make the first move. They yearn to be loved exclusively
    in a romantic way that feels almost vintage. The Venus in Pisces woman probably
    has millions of fantasies in her head that she is rarely brave enough to actually
    act out, but the desire is definitely in there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When she first meets someone, she will unconsciously conform to be what they
    want. Pisces is changeable, allowing her to do this, and it’s often lovely at
    first for her partner to have their *ideal* mate. This can cause problems later
    in the relationship when her true self is different from what she showed initially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    engaging and witty during conversation, and you can easily “hook” people without
    being super outgoing; your energy is enough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will go to great lengths to make your partner feel loved (with presents,
    gestures, dates, etc.) but you need someone who is willing to play along with
    your games, fantasies, and mood swings in return. You don’t mean to be moody,
    but your changeable nature makes it impossible to remain consistent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on the idea of love. Her romantic relationships might feel ever-changing or topsy-turvy
    no matter how stable the actual relationship is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She needs a clear, concrete declaration of love from a partner; she doesn’t
    like to read signs or guess, maybe because she already struggles to formulate
    her own objective theories about love.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus in Pisces woman falls in love quickly and may make grand plans with
    a partner right away, but she will often find that what she believes is love is
    actually just lust or attachment. She generally falls in love with the person
    she meets at first and doesn’t quite understand that there is a deeper soul inside
    the mask of the individual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Long-term, it’s hard for the Venus in Pisces woman to find a true soulmate.
    She might always feel like a piece of her is missing. She desires an intensely
    spiritual reunion that feels 100% right, but her lesson is to learn that life
    on earth takes *work.* Many of these women look for a relationship that isn’t
    grounded in reality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and *real.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    other placements. She has a dramatic flair and can be involved in really emotional
    fights if she feels hurt or wounded. This woman is usually very sensitive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s easy for the Venus in Pisces woman to become jealous, but this is usually
    based on her fear that her partner will leave her, which would wreck her emotionally.
    Unlike other placements, she can’t separate from her emotions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    emotions spiraling), she might enjoy seeing her partner feel jealous or possessive
    once in a while.

    love when she begins making realistic plans.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Turn-ons for this woman include deep, emotional bonding, as well as her partner
    noticing her idiosyncrasies. She might like her partner to be a bit dominant sexually
    while remaining emotionally attached; it’s hard for the Venus in Pisces woman
    to have *good* sex without feeling emotionally involved and loved.
  prefs: []

    may need someone else to give her direction.

    is that she desires. Her needs are ever-changing and it’s hard for her to discern
    what she wants versus what her partner wants.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    vocalize or act on them. An open and caring partner who is willing to listen and
    help the Venus in Pisces woman sort out her desires is necessary to achieve a
    satisfactory sex life.
