    the World always works in circles, and everything tries to be round . . . The
    sky is round and I have heard the earth is round like a ball, and so are all the
    stars. The wind in its greatest power whirls, birds make their nest in circles,
    for theirs is the same religion as ours. The sun comes forth and goes down again
    in a circle. The moon does the same and both are round. Even the seasons form
    a great circle in their changing, and always come back again to where they were.
    Our teepees were round like the nests of birds. And they were always set in a
    circle, the nation’s hoop.”

    in the shape of a circle. This shape represents many things including the wheel
    of time; the wheel of life, death, and rebirth. This is the sphere where we step
    out of the mundane into the metaphysical and spiritual. It is an energetic globe
    upon which all who stand are of equal importance in the greater scheme of things.
    The sacred circle acts as a protective boundary, keeping out negative energies
    and holding in magickal power until it’s ready to be released and guided to its
    destination.

    into pleasing and functional designs. The Monasteries in medieval Europe revealed
    in this idea. Persians made impeccable gardens that included food crops along
    with medicinal herbs, water features, topiary and border work that acted like
    the black and white outline for the whole design. While our Circle Gardens need
    not be quite so complex, using a form like a circle garden can decrease maintenance
    while also achieving the desired result.

    center of the area where your finished garden will reside using a hammer so it’s
    stable. Attach your string in a length suited to your finished goal. For comfort
    allow for 3′ per person who will be using this area. So if you have 6 people you
    will need a 9′ radius and an 18′ circle.'
