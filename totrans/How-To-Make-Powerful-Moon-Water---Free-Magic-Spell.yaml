    water will be more powerful. You can do anything with moon water. Hex, use it
    in spells, curse, and more.

    moonlight will shine on the water. Pray to Nyxe for 30 minutes, then leave and
    go to bed, but leave the bowl of water where it is. Overnight it will become moonwater.
    But YOU MUST take the bowl of water ( now moon water), and take it away before
    sunlight shines on it, or IT WILL NOT WORK, and then put a lid on the bowl and
    label it Moon Water. Glass cups work too.

- en: This is incorrect. IT takes all night to make, not thirty minutes. The specific
    type of full moon can also effect the type of energy of the water. If you do not
    work with Nyx, do not call on her. Also, she is not the Goddess of the moon, she
    is the Goddess of the night, there is a difference. You do not need to call on
    any deity to make moon water, you are charging the water with the moons energy.
    All you need is water, some say distilled, and something to hold it, like a bottle,
    and that is it. You are correct you need to retrieve it before the sun rises,
    but it does not mean the moon water will not work. The water will have lunar and
    solar energy. It can still be used, but it will not be as potent as pure moon
    water.

- en: Moon water is used for divination, purification, cleansing, and spells you wish
    to include the moons energy to. It is not traditionally used for hexes. It is
    used in hex breaking.
