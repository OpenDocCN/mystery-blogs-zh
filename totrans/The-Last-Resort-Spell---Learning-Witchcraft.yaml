- en: If none of the spells you have tried have worked, there is a last resort spell
    that you can try. This spell must be cast on a Friday which is the day most strongly
    associated with Venus as you will be drawing on her power. To add potency to the
    spell, you should cast this when Libra and Taurus are in ascent.

    Cardamom essential oil, a crystal of malachite and green leaves if you are casting
    during Taurus. Pink and royal blue flowers will be needed for casting during Libra
    and you will need a pair of scissors.

    your jaded lover. If you need to stimulate the sexual aspect of your relationship,
    you need to draw a square around the two names. If you are certain that you want
    to spend the rest of your life with the person, you need to draw a circle around
    them. You should then hold the paper in both of your hands, close your eyes and
    create a clear picture of the person in your mind while saying:'
