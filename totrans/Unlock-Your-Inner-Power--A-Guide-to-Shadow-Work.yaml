    unconscious patterns and beliefs that stop us from living our best lives. It is
    a process of introspection, self-reflection, and self-inquiry that can help us
    to gain insight into our behavior and identify any areas of our life that need
    improvement.*'

- en: Shadow Work is a term popularized by Carl Jung, which essentially means learning
    to accept all sides of your character and who you are, or "integrating your shadow."
    Observing who you are and even the parts of you that you don't necessarily want
    to look at, for whatever reason, due to past negative memories associated with
    it, and in order to gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of who you are or
    to overcome internal obstacles that you may have by recognizing them as something
    that's not truly a part of you. That it's ok and perfectly "normal" and, in some
    cases, they can even be turned into strengths or already are and you're just becoming
    more conscious of it.

    because it requires us to delve into our deepest parts, the parts of ourselves
    that we are often not aware of and don’t want to look at. However, it is also
    an opportunity to gain a better understanding of ourselves, to learn more about
    our motivations, and to make changes that will ultimately benefit us.

    of who you truly are, a big part of Shadow Work can also be discovering negative
    memories that may come up to the surface, more and more, once you start working
    with it.

    to the surface in your mind.

    sometimes unconsciously, and, in this case, it can create energetic darkness and
    internal obstacles that you can overcome. These can be **memories that you may
    be holding onto out of guilt or shame**, and it can all collectively create layer
    after layer of thick, energetic darkness that suppresses your energy and **prevents
    you from truly manifesting the full potential** of who you are.

- en: One way to do shadow work is to become aware of our reactions to situations
    and our emotions. We can ask ourselves questions such as “What am I feeling right
    now?” “What is causing this feeling?” “What does this emotion mean for me?” This
    can help us to identify any patterns of behavior or beliefs that may be standing
    in the way of our growth or happiness. Once we have identified these patterns,
    we can then start to work on transforming them.

    actual shadows are a part of light being obstructed in nature, the same can be
    true of your own nature and that the darkness within you is only natural. And
    having a dark side can mean having certain tendencies or personality traits that
    may work for you or help you live more effectively through such traits. However,
    letting go of memories, emotions, or desires that get in your way is a whole other
    thing. **It's a kind of self imposed darkness, even if it's been projected onto
    you by others.** There are probably many things that have been projected onto
    you in life that you were able to just let go of and not hold onto, and sometimes
    there are things that just seem to persist. It all teaches you a little bit more
    about yourself and how you handle things in life.

- en: Another way to do shadow work is to look at our relationships. We can ask ourselves
    questions such as “What patterns do I have in my relationships?” “What do I need
    to do to create healthier relationships?” “What do I need to learn about myself
    in order to create healthier relationships?” This can give us insight into our
    own motivations and needs and help us to make changes in our relationships.

    rid of, it may be helpful to take time to study why you held onto it, as there
    may be a connection with it and other things you may be holding onto. But, if
    it's something that really has to go, and not something you want to hold onto
    anymore, you can work to get rid of it.

    you didn't hold onto in a negative way. Go through your positive experiences in
    life, no matter how fleeting, and make a list if it helps you of all your positive
    experiences, and start realizing when your life has been good.

- en: With the negative memories, look for solutions. At first, **look for the problems,
    but then find an answer or a way to find closure**. Look for ways of moving on
    from situations of the past. If you reinforced these things for many years and
    have a lot of guilt and shame associated with them, it may vary as to how long
    it takes to overcome them, but essentially getting to the point where you realize
    that you're a good person and that what you did or **what happened to you doesn't
    need to be a life sentence**.

    "crimes" and "misdemeanors." Now, the key to unlocking yourself from the mental
    and emotional prison that you unintentionally kept yourself in is to walk out
    of it by stopping the behavior that kept you there, and to leave it behind and
    never return to it again. Imagine the thoughts and emotions of guilt and shame
    as a prison cell of your own making and walking away from it forever.

- en: Finally, we can do shadow work by **looking at our thoughts and beliefs**. We
    can ask ourselves questions such as **“What are my core beliefs?”** “What do I
    need to do to challenge these beliefs and create new ones?” “What do I need to
    learn in order to create new beliefs?” This can help us to become aware of any
    limiting beliefs we may have, and to work on transforming them.

    very personal journey and what works for one person may not work for another.
    However, by taking the time to do this work, we can gain valuable insight into
    ourselves and make changes that will lead to a more fulfilling life.
