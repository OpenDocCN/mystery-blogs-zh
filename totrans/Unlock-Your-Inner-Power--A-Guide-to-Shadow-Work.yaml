    unconscious patterns and beliefs that stop us from living our best lives. It is
    a process of introspection, self-reflection, and self-inquiry that can help us
    to gain insight into our behavior and identify any areas of our life that need
    improvement.*'

  zh: '*影子工作是揭示、理解和转变无意识模式和信念的过程，这些模式和信念阻止我们过上最好的生活。这是一个自省、自我反思和自我探询的过程，可以帮助我们洞察自己的行为，并识别需要改进的生活领域。*'
- en: Shadow Work is a term popularized by Carl Jung, which essentially means learning
    to accept all sides of your character and who you are, or "integrating your shadow."
    Observing who you are and even the parts of you that you don't necessarily want
    to look at, for whatever reason, due to past negative memories associated with
    it, and in order to gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of who you are or
    to overcome internal obstacles that you may have by recognizing them as something
    that's not truly a part of you. That it's ok and perfectly "normal" and, in some
    cases, they can even be turned into strengths or already are and you're just becoming
    more conscious of it.

  zh: 影子工作是卡尔·荣格（Carl Jung）推广的一个术语，基本上意味着学会接受你性格的所有方面以及你自己，或者“整合你的阴影”。观察你是谁，甚至是你并不一定想要因为任何原因（由于过去与之相关联的消极记忆）而看到的部分，以便更深入地理解和了解你是谁或者通过识别它们作为不真正属于你的东西来克服你可能存在的内部障碍。这很好，完全是“正常的”，在某些情况下，它们甚至可以变成优势或已经是优势，只是你更加意识到它而已。
- en: Shadow work can be both a challenge and a great opportunity. It is challenging
    because it requires us to delve into our deepest parts, the parts of ourselves
    that we are often not aware of and don’t want to look at. However, it is also
    an opportunity to gain a better understanding of ourselves, to learn more about
    our motivations, and to make changes that will ultimately benefit us.

  zh: 影子工作既是挑战，也是一个巨大的机会。挑战在于它要求我们深入探索自己最深层的部分，这些是我们通常不自知、不愿面对的自我部分。然而，这也是一个了解自己、了解我们动机的机会，可以进行改变，最终使我们受益的机会。
- en: Aside from the positive side of Shadow Work, which comes with **self-acceptance**
    of who you truly are, a big part of Shadow Work can also be discovering negative
    memories that may come up to the surface, more and more, once you start working
    with it.

  zh: 除了影子工作的积极方面，它与**自我接受**你真正的自我有关，影子工作的一大部分也可能是发现那些可能会浮出水面的负面记忆，一旦你开始与之工作，它们会越来越多。

- en: You may begin realizing that you've been unnecessarily holding onto things,
    sometimes unconsciously, and, in this case, it can create energetic darkness and
    internal obstacles that you can overcome. These can be **memories that you may
    be holding onto out of guilt or shame**, and it can all collectively create layer
    after layer of thick, energetic darkness that suppresses your energy and **prevents
    you from truly manifesting the full potential** of who you are.

  zh: 你可能开始意识到，你一直在不必要地保持某些东西，有时是无意识地，而在这种情况下，它会产生能量上的黑暗和内部障碍，你可以克服这些障碍。这些可能是因为**你因为内疚或羞愧而保持的记忆**，这一切都会形成一层又一层的浓厚、能量上的黑暗，压制你的能量，**阻碍你真正地显现出你的全部潜力**。
- en: One way to do shadow work is to become aware of our reactions to situations
    and our emotions. We can ask ourselves questions such as “What am I feeling right
    now?” “What is causing this feeling?” “What does this emotion mean for me?” This
    can help us to identify any patterns of behavior or beliefs that may be standing
    in the way of our growth or happiness. Once we have identified these patterns,
    we can then start to work on transforming them.

  zh: 进行影子工作的一种方式是意识到我们对情况和情感的反应。我们可以问自己诸如“我现在感觉到什么？”“是什么导致了这种感觉？”“这种情绪对我意味着什么？”这可以帮助我们识别可能阻碍我们成长或幸福的行为模式或信念。一旦我们识别出这些模式，我们就可以开始转变它们。
- en: Now, again, nothing is inherently wrong with your shadow, by itself, just as
    actual shadows are a part of light being obstructed in nature, the same can be
    true of your own nature and that the darkness within you is only natural. And
    having a dark side can mean having certain tendencies or personality traits that
    may work for you or help you live more effectively through such traits. However,
    letting go of memories, emotions, or desires that get in your way is a whole other
    thing. **It's a kind of self imposed darkness, even if it's been projected onto
    you by others.** There are probably many things that have been projected onto
    you in life that you were able to just let go of and not hold onto, and sometimes
    there are things that just seem to persist. It all teaches you a little bit more
    about yourself and how you handle things in life.

  zh: 现在，再次强调，你的影子本身并没有什么错，就像实际的影子是自然中被光阻挡的一部分一样，同样也可能是你本性的一部分，你内在的黑暗是自然的。拥有一个阴暗面意味着拥有某些倾向或个性特征，这些可能对你有利，或者帮助你通过这些特征更有效地生活。然而，放下妨碍你前进的记忆、情感或欲望是另一回事。**这是一种自我施加的黑暗，即使它是由他人投射到你身上的。**在生活中，可能有许多事情被投射到你身上，你可以轻易放下而不坚持，有时候有些事情似乎一直存在。这一切都让你更多地了解自己以及你如何处理生活中的事情。
- en: Another way to do shadow work is to look at our relationships. We can ask ourselves
    questions such as “What patterns do I have in my relationships?” “What do I need
    to do to create healthier relationships?” “What do I need to learn about myself
    in order to create healthier relationships?” This can give us insight into our
    own motivations and needs and help us to make changes in our relationships.

  zh: 做影子工作的另一种方式是审视我们的关系。我们可以问自己诸如“我在我的关系中有什么模式？”“我需要做些什么来建立更健康的关系？”“我需要了解自己的什么方面才能建立更健康的关系？”这可以让我们了解自己的动机和需求，并帮助我们在关系中进行改变。
- en: If you consider it a part of you that you don't like or that you want to get
    rid of, it may be helpful to take time to study why you held onto it, as there
    may be a connection with it and other things you may be holding onto. But, if
    it's something that really has to go, and not something you want to hold onto
    anymore, you can work to get rid of it.

  zh: 那么，你如何摆脱它呢？
- en: Look at your successes, at the situations and things that happened to you that
    you didn't hold onto in a negative way. Go through your positive experiences in
    life, no matter how fleeting, and make a list if it helps you of all your positive
    experiences, and start realizing when your life has been good.

  zh: 回顾你的成功，回顾那些你没有以负面方式坚持的情况和事情。回顾你生活中的积极经历，无论它们有多短暂，如果有助于你，可以列出所有你的积极经历，并开始意识到你的生活何时是美好的。
- en: With the negative memories, look for solutions. At first, **look for the problems,
    but then find an answer or a way to find closure**. Look for ways of moving on
    from situations of the past. If you reinforced these things for many years and
    have a lot of guilt and shame associated with them, it may vary as to how long
    it takes to overcome them, but essentially getting to the point where you realize
    that you're a good person and that what you did or **what happened to you doesn't
    need to be a life sentence**.

  zh: 对于负面记忆，寻找解决方案。起初，**寻找问题，然后找到答案或寻找解决方案**。寻找摆脱过去情况的方法。如果你多年来一直强化这些事情，并且对它们感到很有罪恶感和羞耻感，那么要克服它们需要多长时间可能因人而异，但是基本上要意识到你是一个好人，你所做的事情或者**发生在你身上的事情不需要成为终身刑**。

- en: Be the judge and let yourself off the hook for once when it comes to all your
    "crimes" and "misdemeanors." Now, the key to unlocking yourself from the mental
    and emotional prison that you unintentionally kept yourself in is to walk out
    of it by stopping the behavior that kept you there, and to leave it behind and
    never return to it again. Imagine the thoughts and emotions of guilt and shame
    as a prison cell of your own making and walking away from it forever.

- en: Finally, we can do shadow work by **looking at our thoughts and beliefs**. We
    can ask ourselves questions such as **“What are my core beliefs?”** “What do I
    need to do to challenge these beliefs and create new ones?” “What do I need to
    learn in order to create new beliefs?” This can help us to become aware of any
    limiting beliefs we may have, and to work on transforming them.

  zh: 最后，我们可以通过**审视我们的思想和信念**来进行阴影工作。我们可以问自己诸如**“我的核心信念是什么？”**“我需要做什么来挑战这些信念并创造新的信念？”“我需要学什么来创造新的信念？”这可以帮助我们意识到可能存在的任何限制性信念，并努力进行转化。
- en: These are just a few examples of how to do shadow work. Ultimately, it is a
    very personal journey and what works for one person may not work for another.
    However, by taking the time to do this work, we can gain valuable insight into
    ourselves and make changes that will lead to a more fulfilling life.
