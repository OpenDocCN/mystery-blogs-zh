- en: When one partner’s Sun aspects the other’s Nodes, it tends to shine a light
    on their soul’s purpose and illuminate both the past and the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The North Node represents what the soul is working towards, while the South
    Node shows the past self, or who one were in a past life. Because the Nodes are
    incredibly important in someone’s chart, another person’s Sun aspecting their
    partner’s nodes can have a very strong aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These aspects are sometimes “soulmate” aspects because they indicate that you
    recognize each other from a past life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aspects to the South Node will feel comfortable immediately, but they can also
    hold you back from growing. North Node aspects to the Sun in synastry are more
    uncomfortable at first, but are ultimately more beneficial if you’re ready to
    change and evolve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These aspects can make you feel like you’re meant to be with each other. However,
    you must be careful to keep your own identity separate and to remain an individual.
    Your path is always your own, but your partner *can* help you evolve and learn
    with these aspects.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have the Sun conjunct North Node synastry aspect, you will experience
    a relationship that is filled with growth and change. You both help to develop
    the talents and qualities of the other person, though this can be a bit much over
    time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your immediate attraction may be very powerful, whether this is a romantic or
    friendship aspect. Your bond transcends just typical romance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Sun person will express many of the qualities that the North Node person
    is trying to emulate. Although some of these qualities may feel uncomfortable
    to the North Node person, this is because it can be scary to grow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Sun conjunct North Node synastry aspect tends to be more uncomfortable or
    scary for the North Node person, while it feels natural to the Sun person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this relationship is attractive to both people because it feels like
    it’s really “going somewhere.” If you’re in a Sun conjunct North Node synastry
    relationship, you may be quite active, always learning new things or trying new
    activities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will be especially apparent in the sign that the Sun conjunct North Node
    synastry aspect sits in. For example, water signs make you want to grow emotionally,
    while fire signs are more physically or mentally active.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, this aspect can indicate that you’re new to each other in this lifetime,
    that your souls haven’t met in a past lifetime. Look to see if there are other
    aspects (mainly to the South Node) that indicate a *past* life connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, even fi you do have a past life connection, this Sun conjunct North
    Node synastry aspect will feel like brand new energy. You haven’t encountered
    these qualities in your partner before, regardless of whether or not you met in
    the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This relationship will truly focus on developing each other’s strengths. Look
    to the house that the aspect is in to see exactly *where* in your life these qualities
    will develop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The North Node person will feel that they’re out of their comfort zone from
    time to time. If they’re ready to grow and change then they’ll embrace this readily,
    otherwise they may try to shun the relationship at some point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nevertheless, both people are drawn towards each other by very powerful and
    attractive energy. This relationship simply *feels* right, even if it’s scary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the Sun conjunct North Node synastry relationship is often quite beneficial,
    this isn’t always the case. Even when the Sun person hurts the Node Node individual,
    this can lead to change, so sometimes this aspect manifests in a toxic way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The outcome will depend on how much growing the Sun person has done. If they’re
    egotistical, then they’re likely to teach unconsciously through pain, while an
    evolved Sun would be much better at showing the North Node person the light.

    in a past life, whether your relationship was romantic, familial, or friendly.
    You are simply picking up where you left off.

    to try.

    beneficial to use this aspect by digging deep into your emotions, healing old
    wounds, and pushing each other to grow towards your North Nodes.

    deep relationship that may have been romantic, but could also have been a sibling
    or parent-child bond. You were very influential on each other in your past life.

    you left off. At first, this is a really easy aspect and the relationship feels
    effortless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, the Sun person will feel safe and secure to their partner, but will
    also pull them back into the past life. The North Node may find that they avoid
    their issues and working towards growth when they’re around the Sun person because
    it’s easier to stay comfortable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Nodal person can start to feel suffocated if they *want* to grow, or they
    may start to sense that something about the relationship is simply *wrong*. At
    first, safety and security feel great, but the Nodal person will realize – even
    unconsciously – that they can’t grow without a bit of instability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the Nodal person does try to grow, their North Node qualities might trigger
    the Sun person. Our [Earth Signs](https://teaandrosemary.com/earth-sign-astrology-earth-signs/)
    sit exactly opposite our Sun Signs ([check out more about the Earth Sign here
    if you’ve never learned about this](https://teaandrosemary.com/earth-sign-astrology-earth-signs/)),
    and the Sun person is actively trying to get away from their Earth.
  prefs: []

    one person tries to expand and learn, it triggers their partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    necessarily need to grow together, but they *can* help each other find the *best*
    qualities in their past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    The problem is that each person embodied the most uncomfortable, or worst, qualities
    of these signs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Sun conjunct South Node synastry relationship can help you delve into your
    past and rewrite it, instead of simply ignoring it. However, this takes a lot
    of work from both people; each partner must be willing to contribute and face
    their darkest parts.

    from a past relationship. This square isn’t necessarily bad. In fact, it gives
    you an opportunity to heal this relationship.
