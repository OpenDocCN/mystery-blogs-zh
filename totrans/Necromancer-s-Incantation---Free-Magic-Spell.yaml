- en: It depends on how well you can sense spirits. If you have a limited ability,
    you should feel like someones in the room with you, you might feel them touch
    you if a spirit taps you on the shoulder or something, and you might see something
    out of the corner of your eye like a shadow figure [if you've seen The Conjuring,
    the scene where you see what Laurane sees is a shadow figure, that's what I typically
    see] If you have no clairvoyance [or are just starting to strengthen the ability]
    you might not see/feel anything [it is believed a random shiver is a spirit passing
    through you] as you practice, you might be able to see full manifestations. Not
    everyone can, however. I've worked with spirits my entire life, and while my ''sight''
    as weakened over time, I've always been able to hear them [it's distinctly different
    from thoughts. it would sound like someone's in the room with you] others can't
    see or hear spirits, but they can smell them, or get a strong emotion. It depends
    on your talents.

    It's totally legal since they only take bones humanely or from dead bodies and
    clean them very thoroughly, so no health hazards either. If real bones aren't
    your thing, you can also take casts which are fake bones of a sort. There's also
    another website (can't remember the name) which sells pieces of amber with something
    inside of it (insects, beetles, stuff like that).
