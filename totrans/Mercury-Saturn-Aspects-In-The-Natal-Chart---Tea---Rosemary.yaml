    preferred the company of books to other children. You may have excelled in your
    interests and found it easier to relate to people who are older than you. With
    a strong Saturnian influence in your birth chart, you tend to be serious and mature
    for your age. Developing social skills may take a bit more time, but despite this
    weakness, the conjunction indicates a powerful mind. You may possess talents in
    mathematics, science, and writing, and are typically self-motivated to learn.
    You may enjoy exploring topics such as psychology and philosophy.

    urge to communicate. You might frequently find yourself double-checking what you’re
    about to say, weighing the implications, and sometimes choosing to withhold your
    thoughts altogether. This self-censorship isn’t necessarily about avoiding truth,
    but more about an acute awareness of the potential consequences and repercussions
    of your words. You’re often hyper-aware of how your words could be perceived,
