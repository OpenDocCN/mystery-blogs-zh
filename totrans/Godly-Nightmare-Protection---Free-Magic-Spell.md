**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Picture or symbol of poppy

 Before you go to sleep say this incantation once then put the picture of the poppy flower (symbol of Morpheus) under your pillow:

"Morpheus,God of dreams
When I am asleep I see very bad things
Protect me from any nightmares
So I will have no reason to be scared
So mote it be."

Since you are asking the Greek god Morpheus for protection while you sleep, it will help if you make a sacrifice to Morpheus like burning some food (this is optional but it does help.)
