    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [aventurine ‘the crystal of venus](https://wiccanow.com/aventurine/)‘.
    Today I thought we’d focus on a specific crystal, or more specifically a group
    of crystals, namely beryl.

    and aquamarine. Beryl crystals such as emerald and aquamarine are generally called
    ‘precious beryls’ whilst more cloudy opaque beryls are called ‘common beryls’.

    travels. This spell requires no ingredients other than a small piece of beryl
    and a stick of incense and a small pouch. The best time to work this spell is
    shortly before you are due to leave on your trip as this will ensure that its
    magick is at its most potent.

    piece of beryl into your hands and allow it to warm up. Now place it in front
    of you and light the stick of incense. Use the incense to write in the air above
    the crystal any specific needs or goals related to your planned trip. For example,
    you might like to work with an affirmation such as ‘I am safe and protected at
    all times’. Say the words as you write them, either out loud or in your mind.
    This imprints the words into the ether, the energetic dimension in which wishes
    are transformed into reality.

    and when touching it, say the affirmation again in your mind. This will release
    its powers into your life.

    for its help and guidance and place it on a window sill or ledge to recharge with
    moonlight. When you crystals have been cleansed and [charged](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-charge-your-crystals-15-fantastic-tips/),
    always be sure to store them in a safe quiet space, ready for their next use.
