- en: This is a spell that can change time to the time you desire. Ive tested this
    one with a friend. it works very good so if you need to pass the time quick of
    a boring class, or just to get time to go faster, go on this one.

    speed or slow time.

    tricking our brain. Magic can speed or slow time if you actually put effort into
    it and you are a very good witch!!

- en: All you are doing is changing your perception of time. If you pick a time in
    the future, and then wait a while, that time didn't arrive because of a spell.
    The time came because you waited for it to arrive.

- en: As Tadashi said, you're not changing how time is moving [like casting a spell
    and suddenly it's 2 hours later] but how you perceive time. You know the saying
    ''Time flies when you're having fun?'' Time isn't literally going by faster, you
    aren't noticing time and are in the moment. So 2 hours feels like 2 minutes. If
    this spell works, it would work by making you be more present and not notice the
    passage of time [I use these types of spells all the time to get through work]
