- en: Telekinesis is something that everyone wants, but most people say it is impossible.
    Telekinesis is the art of moving things without your hands. You simply use your
    mental state to manipulate the anergy surrounding the thing you want to use. This
    info is for beginners.

    say we use a pen) and imagine that it is alive.'

    together. Press them on each other. Now, keep your eyes open! Imagine that energy
    is flowing from your core to your hands. Now gather that energy into a ball, and
    slowly seperate your hands until it is like the energy is in between, and you
    are holding it, or making it hover. Concentrate on taking energy from the sun,
    the wind, the earth, anything around you. Focus until you fell like it''s real.
    Psi balls can be used to manipulate objects around you. Try throwing it at something
    tall, like a lamp or tree, and see what happens. Usually nothing will happen unless
    you practice for a while.'

    shield. Imagine making a tunnel from your mind and sight straight to the pen.
    Block everything else out. Take energy from the sun, the wind, the earth (just
    like psi balls) and transfer it to the pen. Make it clear where you want the pen
    to move. Up, down, left right. Make sure you are concentrating and focusing. Practice
    amy take a while, even years, but most people have more mental capacity than that.
    Don''t Overwork yourself. Stop if you feel mentally or physically tired.'

- en: It is quicker to post ''this does not work'' and explain when someone asks than
    to type out a winded explanation repeatedly. The quickest answer is simply telekinesis
    is not real. Magik is a natural force that is ruled by nature and does not defy
    it. On the physical plane, nature has a rather rigid structure. If it is not within
    human nature, a spell will not change this fact. Humans do not have the natural
    ability to move objects with their mind, ergo a spell will not give you this ability.
    There are psychic abilities you can improve with practice, but not moving objects,
    mind control, or mind reading. You can influence people, hypnosis is plausible
    depending on the person. You can even influence people and manipulate them into
    thinking you are reading their mind, but you will not become Charles Xavier with
    Magik. Research clairvoyance and other ''clairs'' as well as exercises to improve
    your psychic abilities.
