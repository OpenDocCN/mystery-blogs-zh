**Intentions Jar Spell**

This Jar spell is for manifesting your intentions.

People set “intentions” all the time, often not realizing that they are setting themselves up for failure. Your wording is very important. If you’ve already read about the Law of Attraction or done any manifestation work, you should be familiar with the concept of “living as if”. The basic idea here is that if you speak and act as though you already have what you want, it’s easier for you to actually attain that thing.

Applying this to intention statements, you will benefit from using words like “am”, “can” and “feel”, avoiding words like “will”. Using the future tense makes your goal seem far away, rather than obtainable. And be sure to write with feeling! FEEL it. Don’t just jot it down and toss it in the jar. FEEL every word your write.

*Gather any herbs, crystals, essential oils, symbols or other items that will align with and attract your intention.*

**You will also need:**

Jar

Red Candle & Matches or Lighter

Sage, Palo Santo or Cedar Incense

Paper & Pen

**Inside my jar is**

*   Rose Quartz: love, harmony in relationships, and self-love
*   Rosemary: home blessing, purification, cleansing
*   Cinnamon: healing, protection, speeds up spells, love
*   Bay leaf: healing, protection, wishes
*   Lavender: happiness, purification
*   Salt: protection, purification

***I wanted to attract love, protection & good health.***

Begin by cleansing your materials with sage, cedar incense or palo santo.

Write your intentions on pieces of paper and fold them three times (three represents growth, inspiration, guidance and manifestation)

Meditate on your intentions for a few moments.

As you add each item to your spell jar speak your intention out loud.

Remember you always want to word things like they are happening right now.

“I am healthy and happy”

“My life is filled with love”

“I am worthy of love”

“Every cell in my body radiates energy”

“I am safe”

Once you are done adding all your items, close your bottle and seal it with your red candle wax. Red can be used for love, protection, grounding, courage, strength, lust, passion, inspiration and new beginnings.

Once your spell bottle is closed, do not open it again until your intention has come to fruition. Place your spell bottle where it makes the most sense to you. If it is a spell bottle for deflecting negative energy at the workplace, keep it near your workspace. If your spell bottle is for creating love and passion with your spouse, keep it near your bed on a nightstand.

Once you feel this spell has come to fruition. You can dump out the earth safe contents and bury them, Ask Mother Earth to accept your items and thank her. If you reuse your jar be sure to cleanse it before the next spell.
