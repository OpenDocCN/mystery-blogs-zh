- en: This spell is done best at the time of the Waning Moon or New Moon. It is not
    done to get rid of a former partner, but to exorcize your bad feelings about them.
    It is sensible to finish the spell by sending loving thoughts to them. Woody nightshade
    is poisonous and you may not care to use it, in which case you can use a bulb
    of garlic.
