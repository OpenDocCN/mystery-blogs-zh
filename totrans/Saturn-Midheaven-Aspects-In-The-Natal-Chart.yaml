- en: Saturn-Midheaven aspects will show how serious, restricted, reserved, pragmatic,
    or focused you appear. The Midheaven often refers to public image, so Saturn tends
    to *restrict* the public image when it aspects the Midheaven.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, Saturn is also the planet associated with Capricorn, a sign that indicates
    business and career success. Capricorn can be quite image-driven, so Saturn-Midheaven
    aspects don’t always mean that your appearance will be stunted or muted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These aspects can be both beneficial and difficult, depending on the angle,
    but they tend to show up in charts when the native is quite serious about their
    career or image.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Saturn conjuncts the Midheaven, your public appearance is inherently karmic.
    You will need to work through your image and come to terms with it. This doesn’t
    mean that you can’t be successful, it just indicates that you will never *appear*
    the way you want to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may experience insecurity from a young age. Even when you do well and are
    successful by society’s standards, you can never get rid of that inner turmoil.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn conjunct Midheaven doesn’t actually indicate *how* successful you will
    be. There are many natives with this aspect who are *extremely* wealthy or famous,
    and there’s just as many people who experience a lot of disappointment in their
    career.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What Saturn conjunct Midheaven *does* indicate is that you will always feel
    criticized, even when you achieve the ultimate level of success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of these difficult feelings, including your insecurity, stems from childhood
    and past lives. As a child, you probably felt that one of your parents (either
    the dominant parent or the father figure) never saw your true potential and failed
    to realize or to articulate your importance in the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may have experienced the absence of your father figure as well. The way
    that this absence manifested will depend on the sign that Saturn conjunct Midheaven
    is in. For example, Midheaven in Capricorn can indicate a father who didn’t provide
    for you monetarily, while Midheaven in water signs will point to emotional absence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This lack of a father figure created a drive to seek recognition. You look to
    other people to tell you when you’ve done a good job. However, you run into a
    blank wall and tend to feel those same negative feelings again, because you don’t
    get the validation you want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, Saturn conjunct Midheaven brings up these feelings again in your career.
    Others may brush you off, even if your achievements are worth recognition. You
    may been seen as too private, reserved, odd, boring, or cold. Often, the way that
    others see you will be influenced by the sing that Saturn conjunct Midheaven sits
    in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may feel criticized no matter what you do. This judgment can come from your
    parents, from larger groups, or from the public eye in general. Unlike other people,
    any critique wounds you in a strong and deep way due to your early interactions
    with this type of judgment as a child.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you probably have a natural urge to do something big or important with
    Saturn conjunct Midheaven. At first, this is usually because you want to prove
    yourself, but over time you will realize that it’s simply because *you* want to
    contribute or to be successful for yourself, not for others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably have a strong sense of inner competition and a drive to master
    your field. You tend to be very hard on yourself with Saturn conjunct Midheaven,
    and this can be helpful when you want to reach a goal, but it can go too far and
    turn into self-defeatism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you can learn how to follow your intuition in your career instead of your
    ego, you can be very successful. Saturn in this position forces you to go within
    and to reevaluate what is truly important to you, then to follow that path.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that Saturn also rewards hard work. You can certainly be successful
    monetarily or career-wise with Saturn conjunct Midheaven, but this won’t happen
    until you transform your beliefs about image and success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, the Saturn conjunct Midheaven aspect can indicate delays in career.
    Just keep trying and know that all things will come with time. Saturn is the strong
    and steady teacher, but this karma rarely lasts for an entire lifetime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn conjunct Midheaven can also indicate that you tend to feel responsible
    for others when it comes to career. You may have a strong sense of guilt when
    you can’t get things done or take care of other people. Remember that you need
    to take care of yourself before you can help others. These feelings should lessen
    after your first Saturn return, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learn to forgive yourself when you fail. In fact, you will learn over time that
    failure is the only way to gain new knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This placement can indicate that you have a karmic duty in the career world.
    Look to the sign that Saturn conjunct Midheaven is in for help determining career
    choices. However, when you get into the career that links to your karma, you’ll
    know it’s *right* because you will simply feel it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must also figure out how to trust your own judgment over that of others.
    People may see you as too ambitious, harsh, entrepreneurial, or odd. It’s important
    to remember that this is *exactly* what you’re here to do, whether or not other
    people realize this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn conjunct Midheaven means that you have a lot of wonderful qualities.
    You probably *never* stop trying when you want to succeed in something. You’re
    hard on yourself, but you will continue pushing, working, and mastering your skills
    until you move through the barrier in front of you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also tend to see the bigger picture. You will sacrifice something now to
    achieve success in the long-term, and you know how to accomplish even the biggest
    of your goals. You’ll always go the inner mile to finish what you started.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you find yourself surrounded by people who judge you or tell you that you
    can’t do something, remember that this is just your Saturn conjunct Midheaven
    aspect in action. Look at the motivation that comes from *within* you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though you may need to overcome adversity and learn how to build a sustainable
    foundation in your business or career, if you’re willing to put in the time and
    effort, you can be extremely successful over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal with Saturn conjunct Midheaven is to follow your path. Build something
    real and lasting, no matter what other people say. Focus on your own destiny and
    follow the careers that feel right, instead of listening to what other people
    tell you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, you feel disrespected by the world, but this will force you to respect
    yourself first. Saturn conjunct Midheaven is the biggest teacher in career. While
    these lessons can be painful and difficult, you can come out on the other side
    as a confident and accomplished individual.

    necessary, but you might prefer to pursue your goals on your own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are probably very specific and careful in your work, and you don’t like
    being around others who are less exacting. Your high standards make it hard for
    you to work in a group without giving up on the things you want and need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn trine Midheaven means that you are naturally ambitious. You probably
    feel the most normal or comfortable when you’re working hard towards something
    you want. You want not only a successful career, but you specifically desire the *image*
    of success and of seriousness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of what you actually do for work, others will see you as serious,
    knowledgable, and disciplined in the workplace with Saturn trine Midheaven. You
    have a lot of self-assurance but you can also back up your words.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, you can even be a bit intimidating to people who don’t feel as smart
    or as accomplished as you appear. Your image just screams proficiency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t take this naturally serious image for granted. With Saturn trine Midheaven,
    you can *appear* impressive, even if you haven’t actually done the work and don’t
    have the skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I have a good friend who is consistently out of work. Her parents
    funded her education, so she’s very knowledgable, but she fails to actually put
    her skills into practice and has spent 10+ years figuring out what she wants to
    do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in order to reap the benefits of your karma.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn sextile Midheaven gives you the *opportunity* to develop a public image
    of seriousness and competence. Although you probably have a large presence in
    the business/career world of your choosing, you can expound upon this image during
    your life, if you choose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You tend to work patiently at tasks until you complete them and real your goals.
    You also take on responsibility if necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, Saturn sextile Midheaven means that as you continue to work hard, others
    will start to recognize these qualities in you. This probably won’t happen right
    away and takes a bit of effort on your part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the trine, Saturn sextile Midheaven doesn’t make you seem automatically
    knowledgable and competent. You must actually do the *work* to be successful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you only try to *appear* successful, people will see right through your facade.
    Real knowledge and skill will be easy to see with Saturn sextile Midheaven. This
    may take many years but will be worth it in the long run.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the world of career. You may sense that your public image is blocked or that people
    just don’t see you as someone important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is often a fear of failure with this placement. You may avoid risks because
    you’re afraid to fail or to look bad.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, Saturn opposition Midheaven develops because one of your parents was
    strict or distant. Either you were restricted by your family/culture, or you were
    simply ignored and had to take on responsibility for yourself at a young age.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may have sensed that you only received praise, admiration, or affection
    when you met certain criteria or followed the rules. In some way, affection was
    conditional in your childhood home.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn opposition Midheaven means that these childhood issues hold you back
    from really pursuing a successful career. Though you will try to escape this karma
    and negative conditioning by turning *to* your career, you will still feel judged
    for your roots.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Even though the trauma is from childhood, it gets brought up in your career and
    through your public image, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may try to cultivate a new image for yourself as someone who is the *opposite*
    of your childhood self. This is a way to escape those negative feelings that you
    had about yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, this tactic will not bring you success with Saturn opposition
    Midheaven. You’re only running from your negative self-image instead of dealing
    with the events that cased your lack of self-esteem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will continue to have a hard time meeting the expectations of other people
    *and* your own expectations until you deal with your inner pain. Saturn opposition
    Midheaven will literally force you to look at your childhood issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Only then will you be able to cultivate the public image that you desire. This
    is because you will tackle career issues from a place of competence instead of
    using your career to compensate for your childhood self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn opposition Midheaven forces you to stop running from your childhood.
    Ultimately, you can be very successful because you’ll truly know what you want
    to do in life, but you need to first go backwards in order to go forwards.

    in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your parents fought or divorced. One of your parents may have been absent, abusive,
    or resentful of you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many ways that Saturn square Midheaven can play out. The key here
    is that your childhood experiences created a deep feeling of insecurity. Things
    in your life were never constant and you didn’t know what you *could* count on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that you could create your own security. This was probably a positive experience
    for you with the Saturn square Midheaven aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    career and your public image. This is what gives you the sense of security you
    were seeking.

    different career in order to achieve this sense of stability.
  prefs: []

    your career. Your image feels disjointed because you don’t have a clear direction.

    having a public image of success feels blocked completely.
  prefs: []

    you aren’t likely to feel content. You may even feel disillusioned with the fame
    or success that you have been chasing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    achieve the type of status that *you *believe is successful. This is a karmic
    aspect.
  prefs: []

    You’ll never find peace if you’re running away from negative feelings. In fact,

    trauma at every turn.
  prefs: []

    or will have fame and fortune but will end up hating all of the things you thought
    you wanted.

    feelings. Figure out what security really means to you and what you truly believe.

    peaceful and *right* intuitively.
