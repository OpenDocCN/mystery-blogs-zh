- en: If life hasn’t been treating you or your loved ones well lately, it may be time
    to learn and perform a potent banishing ritual. Banishing can be performed towards
    people, spiritual beings, and even situations and circumstances that stand on
    the way of personal growth and peace. Basically, you can attempt to banish any
    sort of dark energy, no matter where it comes from.

- en: It is important, however, to note your intentions and focus on them before,
    during and after performing a ritual. Otherwise, if emotions are on the way or
    you’re not focused enough, the process of banishing can backfire, causing unintentional
    harm and attracting negative energies.

- en: One of the most powerful banishing rituals is the New moon banishing spell.
    During this phase of the Lunar cycle, the power or your spell is going to be amplified,
    and there will be minimal negative consequences should you accidentally do something
    wrong.

    won’t be interrupted. Cast your circle if you wish to do so, light your candle
    and slightly burn the charcoal tablet (be careful).

- en: Place the charcoal and the object in a bowl. Crush the charcoal with a mortar
    and smear over the object, focusing your banishing energy on the process. Then,
    when the charcoal is crushed, destroy the object in any way you like (if it’s
    unsafe to destroy, deface or bury it).
