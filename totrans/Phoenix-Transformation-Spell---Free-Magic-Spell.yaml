- en: We understand magick because we've studied it [Tadashi, Lark, myself, and anyone
    else you see telling you certain spells don't work] Magick on the physical plane
    is a source of nature. It's ruled by nature and doesn't contradict nature. Humans
    by nature cannot go ''I want to be a phoenix'' then will themself to be one, which
    is why a spell will not make you one either. It isn't in our nature to do so.
    That said, you can work with phoenix energy, and other planes of existence have
    different laws surrounding magick. If you still don't believe those who wish to
    help pass on their knowledge to new members, that's fine. We're simply trying
    to help you avoid fake spells. [also, Tadashi doesn't doubt every spell, he's
    posted plenty of ''this spell works'' and ''if you change this point, the spell
    works'' comments too. People seem to focus on his comments on fake spells]
