- en: People set “intentions” all the time, often not realizing that they are setting
    themselves up for failure. Your wording is very important. If you’ve already read
    about the Law of Attraction or done any manifestation work, you should be familiar
    with the concept of “living as if”. The basic idea here is that if you speak and
    act as though you already have what you want, it’s easier for you to actually
    attain that thing.

- en: Applying this to intention statements, you will benefit from using words like
    “am”, “can” and “feel”, avoiding words like “will”. Using the future tense makes
    your goal seem far away, rather than obtainable. And be sure to write with feeling!
    FEEL it. Don’t just jot it down and toss it in the jar. FEEL every word your write.

    has come to fruition. Place your spell bottle where it makes the most sense to
    you. If it is a spell bottle for deflecting negative energy at the workplace,
    keep it near your workspace. If your spell bottle is for creating love and passion
    with your spouse, keep it near your bed on a nightstand.
