# Ritual for Finding Your Witch's Familiar - Wise Witches and Witchcraft

> “A ritual is the enactment of a myth. And, by participating in the ritual, you are participating in the myth. And since myth is a projection of the depth wisdom of the psyche, by participating in a ritual, participating in the myth, you are being, as it were, put in accord with that wisdom, which is the wisdom that is inherent within you anyhow. Your consciousness is being reminded of the wisdom of your own life. I think ritual is terribly important.”
> **– Joseph Campbell**

# It all seems so Familiar

A Witch’s familiar is a living animal that becomes a spiritual ally for the practitioner. Common familiars include cats, dogs, birds, lizards, and fish. If you do not have a familiar and wish to establish this kind of close relationship with an animal, this ritual sends out a request for one.

This invitation should not be made without thought. A familiar isn’t merely a “pet”. The animal becomes an intimate part of your heart and soul, and works with you in magickal processes. Be ready for a real investment of time and effort when making the initial connection and also also for nurturing that relationship over time.

## Preparations

Look through some nature magazines that include all kinds of animals. What you get as a familiar can prove surprising, so try to release yourself from expectations. Just because you’re a “dog person” doesn’t mean your familiar will be a dog. When the call goes out, it goes to all elements, and when the right creature receives your message, it will appear.

Next, to prepare for the ritual, place small tokens that somehow honor the elemental energy represented. For example, before Fire put some burning incense; before Earth, some rich soil; before Water, a cup of spring water; and before Air, a feather. In the center of your space have one white candle burning to represent Spirit.

## The Invocation

**East**:

*“Winds of communication, I call to you
Across all space and time
To join me in this sacred rite.
Hail and be welcome.”*

**South:**

*“Fire of illumination, I call to you
From the fire in spirit
To join me in this sacred rite.
Hail and be welcome.”*

**West**:

*“Waters that touch on every shore,
I call to you across the water that is my blood
To join me in this sacred rite.
Hail and be welcome.”*

**North**:

*“Soils of Earth, I call to you
From the land that is my home
To join me in this sacred rite.
Hail and be welcome.”*

**Spirit:**

*“Breath of magick, Ancient One
Bind together these watchtowers in harmony
Of purpose. Come and bless my rite and guide
My energy.
Hail and be welcome.”*

## Body of the Ritual

Stand before your altar. Using your own words, express your desire for a familiar and why this is your wish. When you’re finished, move to the eastern quarter and pick up the feather saying.

*“If my familiar lives in the winds, bring to it my words and wishes.”*

Next, move to the South and pick up the incense burner.

*“If my familiar is a creature of fire and heat, light its way to my home.”*

Move to the western quarter holding the bowl of water saying

*“If my familiar is a creature of water, let these drops guide its way to me.”*

Move to the north, pick up the soil and say:

*“If my familiar is a creature of the forest or trees, carry my wish throughout the land so it can safely find its way.”*

When you’re finished, sit quietly in your sacred space envisioning your home in as much detail as possible. See the doorway, the neighborhood, and anything that could be considered a nearby landmark. This is especially important if your familiar turns out to be a stray creature-this will help it find your doorway.

## Closing the Circle

Walk to the center of the Circle, saying:

*“To the four corners of creation, I send my thanks and gratitude
When the time is right, bring to me my familiar
And help me bond with it in love and trust
Stay if you will, go if you must.
So mote it be.”*

Make notes after the ritual of any impressions or feelings you received. Keep your eyes and ears open for that animal friend to make itself known in the days, weeks, and months ahead. If a long time (over six months) goes by without seeing manifestation, redo this ritual and send out a second call. Your familiar will appear when the time is right.
