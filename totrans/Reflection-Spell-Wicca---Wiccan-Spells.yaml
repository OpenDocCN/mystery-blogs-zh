  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A reflection spell in Wicca is a ritualistic practice aimed at redirecting negative
    energy or influences back to their original source. This type of spell is performed
    with the intention of protecting oneself from harm or negativity by reflecting
    it back to its sender. Reflection spells are based on the principle of the Law
    of Threefold Return, which states that whatever energy is sent out, whether positive
    or negative, will return to the sender threefold.
