**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 Picture of the person (optional)

*   Concentration

*   Focus

*   Voice

*   Empty Room

*   Buddy or person that got hurt

 You can either think and concentrate on the name of the person, or have their picture and concentrate on that. Go into an empty room, close your eyes (if you are thinking of the name) or stare at the picture while chanting this:

> **"You hurt me, but that is fine, but now you have hurt (name/s of friend/s or family member/s) and that is not fine, you must pay for what you have done, so here is your punishment (Give them a punishment like you will be mute, or something like that) What I give you will not be light, but it will not be heavy, instead it will be the same weight as what you have done. So mote it be."**

If this doesn't work the first time, maybe try it a second time, or if it does work and you want the punishment to stay the same be have a harder effect, then repeat it as many times as you think necessary.
But you do need concentration and focus!
You can do this with a buddy or a friend, or the one that got hurt.
