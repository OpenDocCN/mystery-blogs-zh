- en: All three candles are going to be lit and put in front of you. This is when
    you are going to turn off the remaining lights (if necessary). You are going to
    sit in front of the mirror as you do this. You are going to begin to imagine a
    rose-colored light that is grasping onto you. This is when you are going to use
    your mind’s eye and watch as the light starts to pour over you to fulfill your
    desires.
