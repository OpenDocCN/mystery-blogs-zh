    Then Open your eyes after placing each hand over the tape and visualizing you
    flying anywhere you please. Light the candles and say, ''Oh Fire, Earth, Air,
    Water/And Spirit, I call to you in my crescent. I hold a wish I cherish higher
    than the moon. I wish to fly above ye Earth; I wish to soar in your Air; I wish
    to spread my wings and fly above Fire; and I wish to flutter above ye water. I
    wish more than Spirit flight.''

    own wings. It should come to the end if you run out of salt, or in the hurry (I
    did that so Mom would not yell at me for witchcraft, even though I'm the adult)
    Then dowse each candle with rain water and flush them out saying, ''Earth I release
    you from my ( ) in hopes you will spell me high into the hair like the bird. Air
    I release you from my ( ) In hopes you will catch me and hold me close to you.
    Fire I release you from my ( )in hopes you will use your heat to bring me aid
    in my goal and not pain. Water I release you from my ( ) in hopes you will cleanse
    my soul to make it light enough to fly. Spirit I release you from () in hopes
    you will make your being physical so I can fly in mind and body with wings of
    (color). You should have some rain water that you saved from the rain fall. What
    you do now is to mix the rain water with some salt mixed with shower water and
    boil it with the down feathers (if real) or if paper, cut off some downy part
    of the feather and boil it until it is weird soupy thing. (Just don't chow down
    on it but smear it on between your shoulder blades). Then wait 29.5 hours before
    washing it off in the shower. Place the rest in the small bottle on the necklance
    (fairy dust necklaces make good substitute) and string the feather on the necklace.
    Take the potion bottle necklace off when your wings grow but not the feather.
    My people used to wear feathers all of the time even in Western clothes (even
    if they were kicked out of Georgia and Tennessee and went to Oklahoma) If you
    find it weird, remember that Nathienel Boone once wore feathers in his clothes.

    you''re Native American (AKA Pawnee, Cherokee, Apache, etc.) Other than that,
    have fun dying eagle feathers for the spell and having special color feathers
    from the turkey or goose wings. I know some people wet their pants about using
    feathers from birds, but some birds are protected by law for apparent reason.'
