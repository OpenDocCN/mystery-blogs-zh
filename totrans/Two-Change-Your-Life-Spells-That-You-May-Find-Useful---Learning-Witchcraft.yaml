- en: I’m not going to sit here and tell you that magic and lighting candles will
    change your whole world. That would be ridiculous. While there are plenty of websites
    that sell that idea, the simple truth is that change your life spells are approached
    in a far too general way and often do not focus on the actual issue you are trying
    to solve.

  zh: 我不会坐在这里告诉你，魔法和点燃蜡烛会改变你的整个世界。那太荒谬了。虽然有很多网站在销售这个理念，但简单的事实是，改变你生活的咒语往往过于泛泛而不真正关注你试图解决的实际问题。
- en: If that’s the case, then what are they good for? Focusing and opening your mind
    to different possibilities. The idea is that as you build and focus on your spell,
    you’ll also be solidifying your goals in your mind. Once you have a solid grasp
    of your goal, you’re much more likely to notice opportunities. At that point,
    things fall into place quite naturally.

  zh: 如果是这样的话，那它们有什么用呢？聚焦并打开你的思维，去考虑不同的可能性。理念是，当你建立并专注于你的咒语时，你也会在头脑中巩固你的目标。一旦你对目标有了牢固的把握，你就更有可能注意到机会。在那一刻，事情自然而然地就会成形。
- en: So does that mean there’s no point to spells? Not at all! It can be quite calming
    to perform a ritual tied to a spiritual belief. The knowledge of being part of
    a community, a shared history of humanity, can lend a certain feeling of intent
    and power. It’s like the clothing a person wears; the right clothes can put you
    in the right mindset.

  zh: 那么这意味着咒语就毫无意义了吗？完全不是！执行与精神信仰相关的仪式可以让人感到相当平静。作为社区的一部分，人类共享的历史知识可以赋予一种意图和力量感。这就像人们穿的衣服一样；合适的衣服可以让你进入正确的心态。
- en: So here are some spells to change your life.

  zh: 所以这里有一些可以改变你生活的咒语。

  id: totrans-10

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 除去物品的咒语
- en: For this spell, you’re going to want to be certain you no longer want the item.
    Because afterward, you’re genuinely unlikely to find it ever again.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 对于这个咒语，你必须确信你真的不再需要这个物品。因为之后，你真的很难再找到它了。
- en: So find the item, and then hold it in your hand. Look at it, think of ways it
    might be genuinely useful. This works best if you convince yourself that you have
    a special occasion you know you want it for. It makes the next step more meaningful.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以找到这个物品，然后拿在手里。仔细看看它，想象它可能真正有用的方式。如果你说服自己，你有一个特别的场合需要它，那么这个方法会更有效。这样做会让下一步更有意义。
- en: Place the item in a place where you’re absolutely certain you will be able to
    find it again when you need it. Again, the more you believe this, the more the
    spell works.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 把物品放在一个你确信将来需要时一定能找到的地方。再次强调，你越相信，咒语的效果就越好。
- en: And that’s it! Once you’ve walked away from where ever you’ve placed the item,
    you won’t find it ever again!
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 就是这样！一旦你离开了放置物品的地方，你将再也找不到它了！
- en: Circle of Clarity
  id: totrans-15
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Circle of Clarity
- en: Okay, that last spell to change your life was (mostly) a joke. Here’s a slightly
    more serious one. This is a spell you cast when you have a problem and you can’t
    find a solution. The principles behind this ritual involve the idea of expanding
    your consideration and perspective of the problem to ever larger context. If you
    perform it correctly, it will give you the clarity to help identify more of the
    factors that feed into the issue, hopefully giving you the opportunity to fix
    them.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 好的，那最后一个改变你生活的咒语是（大部分）一个玩笑。这里有一个稍微严肃一点的。当你遇到问题而找不到解决方案时，可以使用这个咒语。这个仪式背后的原理是扩展你对问题的考虑和视角，从而更好地识别影响问题的因素，希望给你解决问题的机会。
- en: Create a casting circle. Setting candles at the four corners of the Earth (or
    four directions, or four Watchtowers, or whatever feels right to you) is a common
    way to do so, but it should be in a way meaningful to you. This is your problem
    as it affects the world and life in general. The whole of human life. It’s the
    greatest possible perspective one can have. Casting circles are common in change
    your life spells since change your life spells often need something to symbolize
    the whole of a person’s life. There’s no better metaphysical symbol for that sort
    of thing than a circle!
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 创建一个施法圈。在地球的四个角（或者四个方向，或者四个守护神塔，或者您认为合适的任何地方）设置蜡烛是一种常见的做法，但它应该是对您有意义的方式。这是您的问题如何影响世界和生活。人类生活的整体。这是一个人可以拥有的最大可能的视角。变革您的生活咒语通常需要一些东西来象征一个人生活的整体。对于这种事情没有比圆圈更好的形而上符号！
- en: Then hold an item that represents the problem. It can be a memo, a printout
    of an e-mail, it hardly matters. As long as you look at it and it’s a symbol of
    the issue you’re having. Hold it in your hand, and stand in the center of the
    casting circle. Face Northward, and consider how the problem was immediately birthed.
    That is, the specific, exact actions that caused it in an immediate sense. This
    could be as small as “my partner turned on the light and it startled me”. As long
    as it was the action that triggered the problem.
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后拿一个代表问题的物品。它可以是备忘录，一封电子邮件的打印，几乎无关紧要。只要您看着它，并且它是您正在经历的问题的象征。拿在手里，站在铸造圆圈的中心。面向北方，考虑问题是如何立即产生的。也就是说，导致问题的具体，确切的行动。这可能只是“我的伴侣打开了灯，吓到了我”。只要是触发问题的行动。
- en: Once you’ve clearly and explicitly identified the action, turn deosil (clockwise)
    to the East. The East represents air, and so you should be considering what problems
    the immediate action led to. This should be the immediate problem. Not the problems
    that spiraled, but the upsetting situation directly caused by the action. In keeping
    with the previous example, this could be “the fact that I was scared triggered
    my anxiety”. It should be that specific.
  id: totrans-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一旦您清楚明确地确定了行动，顺时针向东转动。东方代表着空气，因此您应该考虑立即行动导致的问题。这应该是即时问题。不是螺旋上升的问题，而是直接由行动引起的令人沮丧的情况。按照前面的例子，这可能是“我害怕触发了我的焦虑”的事实。应该非常具体。
- en: Once you’ve clarified that in your mind, turn again to the South. The South
    represents fire, and so you should consider the actions and situations that most
    immediately caused the problem to become larger and more destructive. To continue
    with our example, “I wound up having a panic attack, which has multiple long-term
    repercussions for me”. It doesn’t have to be as direct and immediate as the previous
    two because if a fire does anything, it spreads and destroys at an ever larger
    pace.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一旦您在脑海中澄清了这一点，再次面向南方。南方代表火，因此您应该考虑最直接导致问题变得更大并更具破坏性的行动和情况。继续我们的例子，“我最终发作了一场恐慌，对我有多个长期影响”。它不必像前两个那样直接和即时，因为如果火做任何事情，它会传播并以更快的速度破坏。
- en: Turn again towards the West, or Water. This is where the problem has been cooled.
    Not solved. Cooled. At this point, you should consider what’s left after those
    immediate actions. “I am now feeling like my partner did not respect my mental
    illnesses”. You should not consider why, that’s part of the next step. At this
    point, you simply restate the problem, but in the context of the previous truths,
    you’ve found.
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 再次面向西方，或者水。这是问题被冷却的地方。不是解决。冷却。此时，您应该考虑在那些即时行动之后剩下了什么。“我现在感觉我的伴侣没有尊重我的精神疾病”。您不应该考虑为什么，那是下一步的一部分。此时，您只需重申问题，但在您发现的先前真相的背景下。
- en: You then do the same thing but stepping in a small circle. Each time you make
    the rounds, you step the problem outwards. “My partner turned on the lights because
    they had come home from work and the room was dark” might be a good next step.
    You want to avoid judging the actions. In the above example, it doesn’t suggest
    whether or not they knew something, such as that you were napping on the couch.
    It simply states what is true, the room was dark when they got home from work
    and that caused them to turn on the light.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后你做同样的事情，但踏进一个小圆圈。每次你走一圈，你把问题逐渐扩大。“我的伴侣打开灯是因为他们下班回家，房间很暗”可能是一个很好的下一步。你要避免评判行动。在上面的例子中，并没有明确他们是否知道什么，比如你正在沙发上小睡。它只是陈述真实情况，当他们下班回家时房间很暗，这迫使他们打开灯。
- en: You keep doing this, expanding the problem as you walk. Hopefully, as you continue
    to expand the context, you’ll get to a point where the problem will be clarified.
    In our relationship example, it would be reasonable to get to “my partner knows
    my anxiety triggers”, but since that’s a judgment you have to stop and question.
    Is that true? It may not be. If it’s not true, then you’ve found a solution!
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 你要不断这样做，边走边扩大问题范围。希望随着你不断扩展上下文，你会到达一个问题清晰的地步。在我们的关系例子中，可能会得到“我的伴侣知道我的焦虑触发点”，但因为那是个判断，你得停下来质疑一下。这是真的吗？可能不是。如果不是真的，那你就找到了解决方案！
- en: '**Change your life spells** are all similar. The idea is to get you to consider
    your life and your problems. Hopefully, the more you consider and widen your understanding,
    the more likely you are to find a way to change your life. Keep in mind that you
    need to focus on the actual issues rather than a broad term such as changing your
    life with a spell.  Try spells for each issue, and then your life will truly change.'
