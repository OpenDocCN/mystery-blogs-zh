- en: For hundreds of years between the 1400s and 1700s, a craze gripped Europe. Thousands
    of people were accused of practicing magic, and were executed. What could have
    caused so many people to go into a fearful hysteria of witches and their crafts?
    Why would innocent people be targeted in such a way. The history of witches and
    the resultant fear is an interesting and surprising one.

- en: Throughout human history, the idea of witches and magic surfaces again and again.
    In modern times, this concept of witches is used in fairy tales and fantasy literature,
    but in Europe hundreds of years ago, witches were believed to be a heretical threat
    to society. As a result of this belief, about one hundred thousand people were
    accused of witchcraft, forty or fifty thousand of whom were executed, between
    the years of 1482 and 1782.[fsbProduct asin=’B01GAIV342′ size=’300′ align=’right’]

- en: While men could be accused of witchcraft; about 20-30 percent of accused witches
    were male; most witches were female. In some areas, this ratio changed. For example,
    in Moscow, more than twice as many men were accused of witchcraft than women.
    In Normandy, the ratio was three times as many men accused as women.

    for witchcraft. It was believed at the time that, because of the fable of Eve,
    women were weaker spiritually than men. Because of this spiritual weakness, it
    was said, women were more open to being seduced by satanic influences and give
    themselves over to witchcraft.

    old crone in her tattered robes is not far off the true appearance of many supposed
    witches. Old widows were disproportionately represented among the accused.

- en: Being accused of witchcraft for a woman was terrifying, because there is no
    good way to prove a negative, especially in the eyes of a frenzied and paranoid
    culture afraid of the other. Women and men not properly integrated into the local
    culture would quickly have stories invented about them, and these stories would
    grow into dark tales of rituals, magic, and the occult.

    society turn on them. An old widow who prefers to keep to herself with her cat
    turns into a sorceress with her familiar, working dark magic to cause a sickness
    that kills a child. A quiet man who lives in a hut outside of town hunting food
    becomes an occultist performing sacrificial blood rituals to cause a bad harvest.

    between 1482 and 1782 in Europe. Today, of course, witches and magic are perceived,
    in civilized circles, completely differently then back in those days. However,
    the idea of the cruel old woman brewing potions and turning people into toads
    remains in the public consciousness in the form of our stories, passed down from
    when they were believed to be quite real.

- en: Hopefully, the history of witches will change as the years pass and we will
    begin to realize that although a religion, or belief system, is not a reason for
    persecution.  While we see many other examples of this across the world today,
    and in some places there are still people persecuting people for witchcraft, we
    can only work together to create an understanding of one another with the hope
    that one day, the stupidity of this type of persecution will be stamped out. Until
    that day does arrive though, we all need to keep an eye on the evolution of the
    **history of witches.**
