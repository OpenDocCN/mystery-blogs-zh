**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   2 Black Candles

*   Altar

*   Voodoo doll

*   Picture of your victim

*   Something from your victim

*   Pins

 Light two black candles on the altar you have worked up the negative energy and your anger has built.Take the voodoo doll and visualize with intensity that it is your enemy before you. You may even cut out the face on a picture of your victim and glue it to the head of the voodoo doll. If you have any nail clippings or hair follicles or any small item that has the victims vibration on it, you can place it inside the voodoo doll. That will make it a much stronger connection and all the more powerful.

Once you have worked up the negative energy and your anger has drawn near its boiling point, slam it to the altar and stab one time at the doll in the place where you wish to afflict pain. Then take another pin if you so desire and prick the doll once again in a place where you wish to afflict more pain. Each time you stab at the voodoo doll make sure you are visualizing that you are actually inflicting pain on your enemy.

Do not touch the pins after you have placed them. While doing this, recite the following incantation. "Smitten, battered, beaten, and torn: I prick at thee as if a thorn. Suffer now I will not wait. With this pin I seal your fate. Pins so sharp and made of steel: I strike at thee, these pins you'll feel. Smitten, battered, beaten, and torn: I curse you now, your pain is born!"

You may repeat this again for a few days if you wish, adding more pins and leaving the pins that are already there alone. Do not touch the pins after you have placed them. Once again, if you touch any of the pins after they have been placed, the curse will come back on you.
