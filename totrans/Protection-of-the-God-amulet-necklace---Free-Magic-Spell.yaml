    outside. The sun represents male energy (god), as the moon and the earth represent
    female energy (goddess). When you are outside, kneel before the sun with pendant
    in hands. Of course, don't look straight up into the sun, but hold the sword pendant
    to the sun, and say ''almighty father god, consort of the great mother, powerful,
    loving one, with your rays who give life, warmth, and protection upon the earth.
    I ask for your protection. I ask you now, bring forth your powers upon this sword.
    May it offer me mighty protection from negative energies and evil spirits. May
    it cut away negative thoughts and intentions from myself and others around me.
    May this sword ward off physical harm as well, and only allow good into my life.
    Lord of the sun, this sword is powered by your energy. I give you many thanks
    for your protection''
