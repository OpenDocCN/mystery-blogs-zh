- en: The most important thing to do in a dream is to gain consciousness. This is
    not as easy as it sounds, but it is possible to wake up and remain in the dream.
    All it means is that you gain command over your dream-self. I do this automatically
    anyway as an automatic reflex but in a much lesser extent to what you need - I
    begin chanting for protection. Anyway, once you have woken up, DO NOT open your
    eyes. That will obliterate the dream. Once you have woken up, you can do anything
    you want, but I recommend going into a deep meditative state beforehand and creating
    dream-weapons, for when you just can't escape. To create a dream weapon, you must
    be able to at least guess how each section would look or feel, and create it bit
    by bit. Anyway, once your weapon is created you can summon it at any time - just
    imagine that you are holding it.

- en: Summon as much power as you can, and psychically grab the material of the dream,
    hence the need for a strong will. Then, imagine that you are pulling the material
    of the dream away, and see the passage of dream-time go backwards to the last
    part of the dream you found acceptable. At that point you use you will and power
    to ground the dream there. It tires you out though, but at this point you can
    use the previous technique to alter your dream.
