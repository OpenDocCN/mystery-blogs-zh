- en: Place two of the bigger acacia planks side by side, making an 8''x12''x1'' platform.
    Then, place the three bigger silver birch planks on top of that platform, making
    the three walls that are adjacent to the door. Now, put the two 1.4''x2''x1''
    silver birch planks facing inwards on the ends of the bigger sliver birch planks.
    After that, place the two small acacia planks on the ends of those, making sure
    that the silver birch planks are centered on the acacia. You have ow made the
    fourth wall and doorframe. You're almost finished, just two more steps to go.
    Now, place the last two silver birch planks in between the acacia doorframe. Finish
    it all off by placing the last two acacia planks on top of the four walls. Be
    sure to put 20$ inside the ''fort'' before you use the applicants, or it won't
    work.

    birch, the outer ends of the rest of the silver birch, and the acacia doorframe.
