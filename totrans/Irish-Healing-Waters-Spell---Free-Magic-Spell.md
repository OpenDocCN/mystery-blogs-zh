**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Lavender

*   Violet

*   Rosemary

*   Anointing oil

 Take equal parts of lavender, violet, and rosemary. Empower them and then boil them in a pot with about a quart of water over medium heat. When the water is richly colored and the herbs are scenting your kitchen, drain the water off into a jar. A plain coffee filter works great for this. Place the jar in sunlight for an entire day to absorb the radiant energies of the sun. (You can do this on a Wednesday to add the healing powers of mercury to the spell). Occasionally look at the jar and add your own energies to it. Just before sundown fetch the jar and hold it firmly between your hands just below your naval. Feel your desire to be well filling the jar and with your minds eye see it glowing brightly as the sun. Chant these words until you have filled the jar with as much energy as it will hold.

By the herb and by the sun wellness and I are now as one strengthening energies now are merged. Baneful energies now be purged.

Anoint spots where illness lurks or on your belly if you are unsure where the source of discomfort lies. Or pour contents into bath water.
