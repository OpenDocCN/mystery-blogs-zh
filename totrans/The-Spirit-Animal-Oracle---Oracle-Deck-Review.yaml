    who is also behind other popular decks like the Wisdom of the Hidden realms or
    The Good Tarot. This is my first deck from her so I was really excited to try
    it out.*'

    is a mix between the usual suspects (wolf, owl, eagle, dolphin) with some more
    surprising choices like Porcupine, Bobcat or Wombat. I personally enjoy that,
    it give it a bit more of a character, this may especially be interesting for advanced
    deck collectors who are getting tired of all of the wolfs everywhere.

    it goes beyond the industry standard, the booklet is thick and very well written,
    card stock is robust yet easy to shuffle and print quality is very detailed. One
    of the first things I noticed and was personally please with is the number of
    cards: 68\.'

- en: Most Oracle decks have somewhere between 42-50 cards and I am finding it usually
    not enough to provide some really in depth reading and variety outside of a single
    card ‚Äì advice of the day spread. So that is how I am using most oracle decks and
    for more complex situations I am reaching for a tarot.

    card readings, in a way I rarely see in oracle decks.

    guide and those sentences come together as almost a poem in multiple card readings.

    Fish Spirit** : *There is always enough* and **Ant Spirit**: *Time to collaborate*.
    Makes perfect sense right? I know! Colette give examples of multiple card spreads
    in her booklet so I do assume this was her plan all along. Overall, I am finding
    this oracle deck precise, easy to understand and easy to work with even for a
    complete beginner. It gives very useful advice and clarity.'
