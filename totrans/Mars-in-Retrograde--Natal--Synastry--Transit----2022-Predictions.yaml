- en: Most students of astrology are a little scared of retrograde planets. They’re
    super hard to read and there’s a lot of conflicting information out there about
    the retrograde cycle. What do retrograde planets actually do in the birth chart?
    What does Mars retrograde really mean?

    inward. While this is true, it will work differently for each planet and depend
    on the sign that the planet is in.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A planet is considered “retrograde” when it appears to move backward in the
    sky. This only happens from our perspective here on earth, since planets don’t
    actually move backward in their orbits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Retrogrades are basically just illusions due to all of the planets moving at
    different speeds, but they’re very important in astrology. Retrogrades usually
    mean that the energy is turned inward, and this is true for Mars, but there are
    many more specifics involved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mars goes retrograde every 26 months for 58-81 days, so it’s one of the more
    “rare” retrogrades. This means that the effects of Mars retrograde may be stronger
    on a personal level, but that this transit could also have an intense worldwide
    impact.

    is turned inward. There might be a lot of inward rage that is expressed in small
    bursts instead of the more typical anger that is shown at appropriate times.
  prefs: []

    For example, someone with Mars retrograde natal might struggle to tell others
    when they *are* angry, then act out passive-aggressively in order to relieve this
    tension.

    influenced by serious karmic connections to the past. This can include past lives,
    childhood, or both.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the Mars retrograde placement, you might find that you have trouble asserting
    yourself due to a prior lifetime (or multiple lifetimes) where aggression was
    misused in some form. This could mean that you were unnecessarily aggressive towards
    others and/or that you experienced this aggression towards yourself from others.

    is “bad” and that it’s always better to be passive.**'

    aggressor but you were later shunned by society or placed in jail due to your
    destructive nature.

    your childhood. Most commonly, I see those with Mars in retrograde as having parents
    (usually the father or the more dominant parent) or caregivers who were abusive
    *or* who were extremely strict and unaffectionate. In both cases, they were probably
    intolerant of outbursts, anger, and any form of self-assertion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to the way you were raised with Mars retrograde in the natal chart, you
    learned not to express healthy anger. Instead, you figured out that it’s better
    to bottle this anger up inside so that no one can see it. You may even feel ashamed
    or guilty when you experience anger, regardless of whether or not you express
    it.
  prefs: []

- en: With Mars retrograde in the natal chart, you might struggle to stand up for
    yourself due to fear. You could have “implosive anger,” which means that your
    anger builds up until you have an internal breakdown. You may also build resentments,
    as you avoid speaking up for yourself, until you burst.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    retrograde energy is especially difficult and painful to face. However, there
    is usually no mistaking these qualities as they turn their anger inwards.

    father/dominant parental figure) might have had a difficult time moderating his
    own “drive.”

    “drive,” or that he didn’t understand how to effectively use his Martian energy
    to make forward progress in some way.

    own Mars sits. This can show up in work, in friendships, within the family, in
    religion, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, one client of mine grew up in a home where his father was always
    doing favors for other people. His father was an extremely angry man at home (so
    the boy could never show his own healthy anger due to the risk of making his father
    mad) but out in the world, he gave away his work for free to acquaintances and
    people he barely knew. The family was very poor, so this drive was clearly misplaced,
    since he could not always afford food for his family but continued to do free
    work for others. He did not have a clear sense of motivation to work, make money,
    and provide in a typical way. It’s possible that he tried but just couldn’t express
    these Martian qualities.
  prefs: []

- en: With Mars retrograde natal, you may have learned confusing lessons about drive
    as a child. This doesn’t mean that you personally don’t have a drive (some people
    with Mars in retrograde are extremely driven!) but it does mean that those confusing
    messages exist in your subconscious mind.
  prefs: []

    from your fear of being punished should you try to assert yourself. Subconsciously,

    that you want it, so you act in a counter-intuitive manner.

    always off. You could easily come on too strong, then come off as flightly – it
    might be hard for others to pinpoint exactly what you’re feeling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably express your anger in sharp bursts that seem to come out of nowhere,
    then you feel guilty and bad for showing your anger at all. You hold your feelings
    and desires in until you quite literally explode. Most of the time, you probably
    have a pretty peaceful nature until you can no longer bottle up your feelings.
    After the explosion, the cycle begins again.
  prefs: []

    are afraid to) properly express your anger in a direct manner. This will be especially
    apparent in the house and sign where your Mars falls.

    especially when Mars is in the 7th house or has a strong aspect to relationship
    planets (Venus, the Moon, Saturn, Juno, etc.). They can’t stand up for themselves
    in relationships so it’s easy to walk all over them, but that rage is always building
    internally.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sheer force will not work for you with Mars in retrograde. Typically Martian
    energy will feel blocked (and actually is blocked due to your karma) so you will
    need to use your inner guidance instead of sheer will.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first lesson here is to learn to listen to your intuition. In a past life,
    you ignored your intuition and acted aggressively, which led to your current fear
    of aggression. This scared you, but you now have an opportunity to move past this
    fear by developing your own inner voice instead of repeating the cycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your inner voice will always tell you when and how to stand up for yourself.
    When you let others step on you, AND when you boil over and rage out at others,
    you are ignoring your inner voice. This will never lead to true peace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, you will want to learn how to express your emotions in a healthy way.
    There are a variety of books, courses, and therapists that can help with this.
    A good place to start is looking into implosive anger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important that you learn the difference between *aggression* and *assertion*
    with Mars retrograde in the natal chart. *Assertion* is beneficial and should
    be practiced on a daily basis. Over time, you will find that asserting yourself
    more actually leads to less aggressive outburts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It takes quite a bit of practice to be able to 1) read your inner voice correctly
    and 2) express what you’re feeling in a healthy, non-explosive way, but this is
    the lesson for those who have Mars retrograde. If handled properly, Mars retrograde
    in a birth chart can help you learn to be tolerant, expressive, kind, and persistent.

    Any residual anger that’s festering in your subconscious will suddenly feel much

    management and resolve issues that have been buried deep in your mind.

    or getting things done, but that is because this is a time of reflection. It’s

    before we can move forward.

    the Mars retrograde transit. This is often a sign that we’re moving in the wrong
    direction and need to reexamine something about our path. Mars retrograde in transit

    steps forward and really heal any deep-seated trauma or anger within your body.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the synastry chart, Mars shows how each partner asserts themselves (in regular
    life or romantically) and how they *act*. It also shows how they fight or deal
    with conflict. While Venus shows the things that an individual appreciates, the
    things that make them feel loved, Mars shows the active role that the individual
    takes in the relationship. It’s about what someone *does* versus how they feel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Mars retrograde in the synastry chart, the individual may struggle to assert
    themselves, especially in any areas that Mars touches. For example, if person
    A has Mars in retrograde square person B’s moon, then person A will have difficulty
    dealing with their partner’s emotions and meeting them head-on. They may either
    pacify their partner when they get over-emotional or shut down.

    to assert themselves in the relationship, specifically in the house that Mars
    retrograde lies in. For example, if person A’s Mars retrograde sits in person
    B’s 3rd house, then the Mars retrograde individual (person A) will have trouble
    with communication, specifically in this relationship.

    opinions causing this conflict.

    is a *great* planning time if you take advantage of these few months.
