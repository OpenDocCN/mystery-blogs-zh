# Cleansing/Recharging Ritual

Here is a very simple cleansing ritual I like to use when recharging my crystals.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Cleansing/Recharging Ritual'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 clear container, preferably clear glass

*   3 tablespoons of non-iodized salt (sea salt is fine as well)

*   clean water

*   Time of day: Start from night of the full moon and continuing throughout the day until sunset.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 clear container, preferably clear glass

*   3 tablespoons of non-iodized salt (sea salt is fine as well)

*   clean water

*   Time of day: Start from night of the full moon and continuing throughout the day until sunset.

 With a clear container filled with clean water, mix it with non-iodized salt or sea salt. Place your crystals in the container. Next, put the container outside on a balcony or on a window sill. Let the full moon recharged the crystal with its energy. Let the container sit there throughout the night, then throughout the day so the crystals may be recharged with the solar energy as well. Balance is key: recharging from the feminine moon and masculine sun energies. After completing the cleansing, crystals are fully charged and ready to be used. You may also use this method to cleanse your amulets or other possessions. No words are needed, but if you like, you may meditate a little or say a few words of your own. Feel free to revise the spell to your own comfortability.
