  prefs: []

- en: A familiar is an animal you have a spiritual connection with [and some don't
    believe they're physical animals but spirits] you may have a connection with a
    wild animal but those are usually seen more as a type of animal guide or a passing
    hint from the universe you might need something [like if you keep seeing chipmunks
    just hanging around you, it could be saying you need more fun carefree energy
    in your life and not this chipmunk is your familiar] that said, most familiars
    are your pet because they are domesticated, calmer around humans, and you can
    observe and connect with them [again, some believe you can train a pet to help
    you in ritual like a familiar] as for the effectiveness of this spell specifically
    I cannot say since I've never cast any spell to find my familiar

- en: 'Pets aren''t actually able to become familiars, this is a misconception. Familiars
    are a sort of spirit, not a living, breathing animal. Refer to below link for
    more information: https://www.spellsofmagic.com/read_post.html?post=857694'

- en: This is not how you get a familiar. Historically, familiars were demonic creatures
    which took the form of an animal so they could spy on villagers and report back
    to the witch they served. Today, familiars are seen as pets you have a special
    bond with and the pet is able to sense Magik. While some claim you can train pets
    to be like familiars, a spell will not turn a regular pet into one you have a
    spiritual link with. I would also like to warn that having a familiar because
    it sounds cool is the wrong reason. This is a spiritual link. When the pet dies,
    a part of you is lost with it. It is a worse grief than the normal loss of a pet.
    You can sense when the animal is in destress and vice versa.
