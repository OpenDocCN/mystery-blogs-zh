# Dragon Transformation Spell by Paraselene

I recommend this spell, I did it and it worked. You wont become immortal, but you wouldnt want that because the world's gonna end someday and you'll be stuck in it...

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Dragon Transformation Spell by Paraselene'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Night Time

*   Alone

*   1 Piece of paper

*   1 pencil

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Night Time

*   Alone

*   1 Piece of paper

*   1 pencil

Make sure you are alone

Draw what you want to look like as a dragon. (Or print one out of your OC - Original Character, if you have one)

Then fold the paper hamburger style

Write all the information about your dragon self, such as height, gender, powers, scale color, eye color, strength level, element, etc.

Fold it once more, hamburger style.

Draw a pentagram. (If you are unfamiliar, it's basically a start with a circle surrounding it, connecting all the star's points.)

Spell: Say 3x
Oh great and powerful beast become a part of me so I can go in and out of you.

Now every night for 3 nights you need to repeat the spell before you go to sleep. After you are done chanting, put the paper underneath your pillow and you should have a lucid dream about you being your dragon. If not, a regular dream. If you don't have a dream at all, you may day dream being your dragon.

Once you are done completing the spell, all you have to say is ''Dragons rule the sky'' to transform.
To turn back, claw the ground 3-5x and roar as loud as you can.

Optional: (What I did)
I had three white candles that I lit and put them in a triangular position with the paper folded with the pentagram on it in the middle. Then I whispered ''So mote it be'' ten times, I then prayed and meditated.

There are no side effects, but sometimes there are and these are common:
Head aches
Body aches
and improved vision and hearing.

Hopefully the spell works for you, and let me know if you have a question about the spell.
