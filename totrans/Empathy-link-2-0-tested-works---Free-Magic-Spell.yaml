    ( insert name of desired person here) the link will be in affect unless we are
    both face to face and wish to get rid  of it and if one of us dies then the other
    person will most likely die as well this Empathy link will be exactly like the
    one that Percy Jackson and Grover Underwood have in the books and we will have
    the link as soon as I finish this spell so mote it be."

    they probably didn't have another example
