You cannot summon an imaginary creature. Pokemon are not real.

Indeed you can try. I merely wanted to save people time and energy. If you still wish to try it, despite knowing it will not work, nobody is going to stop you.

This is one where I think it could work, just not physically, but you could model a servitor after a pokemon and summon that.

You are correct. You could redesign this spell to create an energy shaped and programmed to be like a pokemon. Servitors need a purpose, however. So, if you want it to bring you joy, model it after a cute Pokemon. If it is meant to be a protection, a powerful Pokemon. Servitors vanish after they fulfil their purpose, but you can resummon them. There are other types of energy creatures, so a different type might work better for your intentions. Research them and try it out.

It's a very good thing that this won't work. Haha.
