# Violet's Moon Water Recipe

Moon Water can be an incredibly versatile ingredient. Whether it's cleansing your tools, giving your body a refresh, or just a simple enhancement to your magick, having the energy of the moon in liquid form proves quite beneficial to an opportunistic witch. This tutorial is for straight moon water, the optional ingredients are for powering up a specific intention.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A bowl or clear container

*   Water (Clean and safe drinking water if you plan on ingesting)

*   An undisturbed area with access to moonlight

*   Paper and Pen (Optional)

*   Crystals (Optional)

## Casting Instructions for 'Violet's Moon Water Recipe'

 Before beginning, decide what moon phase you will leave the water under. In the most simplified terms, full moons are good for letting go and getting a fresh slate. The water made from a full moon will serve best in cleansing your home, tools, and body. On the other hand, the water made under a new moon will serve you well in beginning anew with focused intentions and manifestations. If you have a very specific intention you with to instill on the water, consider looking into the zodiac of the moon you're performing under to see if it fits. 

1.  Wait until after moonrise on your chosen night
2.  Pour the water into your container
3.  Place the container outside or on a window sill with access to moonlight.
4.  Choose crystals that reflect your intention and put them in or around your water container (Optional)
5.  Draw a sigil or write your intention and place that under or on the side of your container (Optional)
6.  Think or preferably say aloud an affirmation. This is arguably the most important step as magick does not work without intent. Only you can know your intention and thus customize your affirmation. A simple short one size fits all affirmation would be:

                "Let the moonlight soak into this water so that it may too run deep with this moon's abundant energies. So Mote It Be"

            repeated several times. You may say your affirmations passionately while looking up at the moon like a prayer. This works              best if you work with moon deities who may call on by name. You may also whisper your affirmations into the water itself. 

        7\. Leave the water in its undisturbed location overnight.

        8\. Collect the water in the morning. I strongly suggest before sunrise as sunlight can overpower the newly formed moon                    water.

        9\. Store your moon water in a safe dark place preferably away from artificial lighting and specifically sunlight.

       10\. Enjoy your moon water! Cleanse your space, cleanse your tools, use it to amplify your magick, or perhaps add it to a                     bath or make a tea to cleanse yourself.
