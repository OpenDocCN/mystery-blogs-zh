    protection spell that blocks almost all magic-based attacks. First off, you going
    to want to either be holding the item that is enchanted or wearing it. Then, for
    the first layer, you have to write with your finger (on your skin) your magic
    symbol. Then, you must say

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '''''Protect me, and mote be it!'''' (Simple, i Know) You must imagine your
    energies flowing into the mark. You should feel a heady feeling come over you
    and a warm wave pass through your body. Hopefully your energy is doing ok at this
    point, but everyone is different. Next, cast Aura Shield with at least 3 layers.
    Then, imagine both the aura shield and the Protection spell (CAN BE CAST ON ANYTHING,
    BUT THIS SPELL REQUIRES IT TO BE CAST ON YOU!) gradually draining from you into
    the item. You''ll have to do this every time you deactivate the shields. Then,
    imagine a lock sealing the spell shut so that it only can be opened when the user
    says a word you specify (I use ''''Protect'''') Whenever you wish to activate
    the protection, say the word and the shield will spread across your body and be
    maintained by the enchanted object. With practice, the shield will slide on an
    off faster and you''ll enventually only have to think the word.'
