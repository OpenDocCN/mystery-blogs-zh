# Calling your spirit guide

  Rated 5/5 Stars

A formalized ritual to make a declaration to invite and meet with a spirit or entity. This spell was Primarily designed to create an opportunity to meet with your spirit guide/guardian, or other positive entity.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1- tools to draw and empower a personal circle. If you are not familiar with circles there are many examples on the site. Or you can go with my previous entry; http://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/Love+Spells/At traction+Spells/24431/page.html

*   2- Four candles, one per basic element. They can be colored or non, depending on personal preference. It can be as simple as four tea lights.

*   3- Something to light the tea lights with.

*   4- Though designed for calling your guide, this spell can be used for summoning other entities as well. If they are known to favor offerings, having one with you would be helpful.

## Casting Instructions for 'Calling your spirit guide'

*As a brief note, this spell is written as a formal, ritual-based casting. However portions can naturally be adapted to visualizations. Just as any verbal statements are what worked for me and best seen as guidelines. You can adapt the wording to suit your preferred language, cadence, or of course rhyme. Just be sure the words convey the calling in a form of request, and that they are in line with your desired intent.

1- Prepare by contemplating what you are wanting to summon and why. What is the goal of what you are calling to you. not just what you are wanting to summon, but why you are summoning it. Use this to choose your wording when you declare what you are calling for later, during the spell. For example there is a subtle difference between saying ''I search for my Spirit guide.'' and ''I search for my spirit guardian.''

2-gather what you need/use to cast a circle and call your corners. Also have four candles. votives/tea lights are fine, or colored candles if you have them- one for each basic element.

3- choose your place and lay your circle. Ideally this should be in a natural setting, but anywhere you have room to draw and close a circle will do. Just be sure it is private enough to avoid being disturbed. Draw and close your circle and call on your corners however you usually do, and seat yourself in your circle comfortably. Or of course see the example in the spell components section.

4- Set the four candles down in a row a short reach out in front of you. Take the first candle and move it directly in front of you. Light the candle, and declare this intent.
''I light this lamp of spirit. May its light reach across to the plain of air. May it make contact and illuminate the passage between our worlds. I search for [the being you want to contact], may this light lead you to my presence.''

5- repeat with the second light, making the same plea in the same wording except to the plain of fire. (''May its light reach across to the plain of fire.'') and again for earth and water, lighting each candle in turn. When finished this stage, all four candles should be burning, close together, and directly in front of you. You can arrange them however you want. I had them in a tight diamond, each element towards its respective corner.

6- you can close your eyes, or look intently into the middle of the four flames so that when your eyes go out of focus their light starts to blend together. Either way visualize four bridges coming towards your location, each one lit by the corresponding candle.

7- Make the next declaration with honesty, intention, and confidence.
''May these lamps dispel the darkness, and light the way. May the light reach to the planes of the elements and to the realms of spirit that [the entity you are trying to call on] may come to me. I invite you before me. I ask for your presence to [state your intent and goal.IE; to become aware of your spirit guide, or call the presence of your guardian, or to gain specific knowledge/insight from or about a specific entity, etc]

The called entity may make itself known to you then and there, it may remain silent, to make itself known later. Or it may not come at all. Like any magic this depends on many things. The purpose of this spell is to declare your intent, and your goals, and to extend an invitation for an entity to come to you to help you meat that goal. If you are using this working to invite a specific known entity, this would be the time to do so by placing it outside the circle in front of you.

Do your best to keep expectations curbed. Especially with an open ended request like 'my spirit guide' as it will come in the image it is meant to, not in the image you want or guess or hope for. And if that form does not match your expectations you may skip over the sign of presence and miss entirely that you were successful. Instead do your best to be empty of assumption and be silent and still.

8- After a time of silence and contemplation, or, if you are fortunate enough to gain some form of interaction and it is concluded, take a moment to return to your position of authority and magical thought and intent. When returned to focus, state; ''As the lantern fades, the paths shall close.'' then in one breath, blow out the four candles.

If this is being used to gain a connection to your guide or guardian, there is no need to dismiss the entity. If it was a specific entity like a god/goddess, then be thankful for its presence even if you felt nothing or had no inkling to it being there, and include a statement of asking the spirit to return to its rightful realm in peace before blowing out the candles. Then end the ritual by opening your circle and clearing it. If you included an offering you will want to take it to a natural place or setting if it isn't there already, and leave it behind. It is no longer yours.

Just a quick correction. In section 7 I accidentally deleted a couple details while editing some typo's. Where it says ''If you are using this working to invite a specific known entity, this would be the time to do so by placing it outside the circle in front of you. '' It should read ''If you are using this working to invite a specific known entity, and you have an offering to give, this would be the time to do so by placing it outside the circle in front of you.''
