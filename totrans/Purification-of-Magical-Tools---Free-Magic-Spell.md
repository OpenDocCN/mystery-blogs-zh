Purification Ceremony

To cleanse your altar tools of negative energy.

Place your instruments on your altar. Light a plain white candle (unscented), this represents purity, and recite the following ritual;

O Instruments, I Conjure Thee By The Power Of The Heavenly Host, And By The Elements Of Fire, Wind, Earth And Rain, That Thou Shalt Be Clean Of Foul Creatures And Obtain Every Virtue Unto Thyselves, And Work In All Manners Directed From This Time On. By The Splendor Of The Planets And The Divine Miracle Of Creation Mote It Be!

Sprinkle your instruments with the consecrated salt and cover them with a piece of clean linen (do not use any other fabric). All your equipment is now charged with positive energy and is ready to be used. If you add any new products please repeat the ceremony for these items...you do not want any outside, negative influences affecting your magick!
