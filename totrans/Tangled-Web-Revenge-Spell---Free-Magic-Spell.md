 PROCEDURE

1\. Place link to target at center of the spider web and say:

''Little spider, Queen/King of Lies,

Pulling the wool over peoples eyes.

Oh what a tangled web you weave

When you practice to deceive.''

2\. Envision the web as the targets web of lies, and all the people who have been pulled into it, whether as knowing accomplices or innocent victims (you need not know who these people actually are). Say:

''Other spiders that came to your aid

With you this sordid web have made.

So many caught like helpless flies,

Victim to your vicious lies.''

3\. Anoint candle however you prefer.

4\. Light candle and say:

''As this light shines thought your deceit,

Your lies the Truth will now defeat.

No matter how hard you all strive,

Your treachery will not survive.''

5\. Take a few moments to charge the candle with energy. 6\. When ready, take the candle and carefully drip wax around the spiral of the web (not the ''anchor lines''), starting at the center. Say:

''With this wax your lies are stayed.

Confessions of truth will be made.

The light of Truth sets your victims free.

This is my desire, so it will be.''

7\. Let candle burn down.

8\. Once candle is burned down, dispose of web.
