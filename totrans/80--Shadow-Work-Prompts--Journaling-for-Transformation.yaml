    guilt, or shame – and take a few moments to sit with those feelings

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ask yourself why you feel this way, and if there is something you can learn
    from your emotions. Once you have identified the source of your feelings, take
    steps to address it. This can involve talking to a friend, journaling, or engaging
    in creative activities. Through this process, you can process and heal your shadows,
    ultimately leading to greater self-awareness and personal growth.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Journaling is an effective tool for shadow work. It helps to identify and process
    any negative emotions, thoughts or beliefs we may have about ourselves that are
    holding us back. **To begin, start by writing down your feelings and thoughts
    in a stream of consciousness style.** This will help to identify any underlying
    patterns or beliefs that you may have. Once these have been identified, you can
    use your journal to explore these topics further and challenge any negative beliefs
    you have. Through regular journaling and reflection, you can **begin to transform
    these negative beliefs into positive ones**. It is also important to be compassionate
    and understanding as you go through this process. Shadow work can be difficult
    and challenging, so it is important to be gentle with yourself as you go through
    it.

    and embrace our shadows. It enables us to become aware of our inner darkness and
    heal our wounds so that we can move forward on our journey of self-growth. To
    start the process of Shadow work, it is useful to have a list of prompts to help
    you uncover the aspects of yourself that have been hidden away. Some prompts that
    you can use for your Shadow work include: *What parts of yourself are you rejecting?
    What are some of your biggest fears? What are your hidden motivations and desires?
    What are some of your most shameful thoughts? What beliefs do you have that limit
    you? What aspects of yourself do you want to accept and heal?*'
