- en: The first step needs to be done during a waning moon phase and finish before
    the night the new moon appears. You are using the power of the dark moon to banish
    and purge the problems that are holding you back from getting the job you want.

- en: The second part of the spell is aimed at a new beginning should be started on
    the first night of the new moon. Theoretically it can be cast at any time of day,
    but it is most effect when done at 9 PM in the evening or at midnight.

- en: Inscribe the things that are holding you back, such as your nerves, your lack
    of experience, anything, and write those same things on one of the pieces of parchment. From
    there, the candle should be dressed in banishing oil and lit up every night for
    nine nights, timing it so that by the ninth night, the candle will be burned out. Focus
    on the flame, visualizing and focusing on the things you are certain are holding
    you back disappearing.

    the ashes have cooled down, take them outdoors and scatter them to the wind watching
    the last shackles on your ambition drift away.

    yield for you. Inscribe these on the green candle and write them on the second
    piece of parchment, after which you should anoint the candle with a drawing oil.

    and gaze into the flames the things you want to come your way and how peaceful
    and prosperous your life will be when you achieve them. On the fourth night, burn
    the second piece of parchment and extinguish the candle via a snuffer or between
    your finger and thumb.

    candle to give thanks to your favored deities as a gesture of gratitude for their
    assistance with your sorcery, following up with the words *“And let it be done,
    that it harm no one.”*
