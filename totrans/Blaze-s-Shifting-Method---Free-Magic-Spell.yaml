- en: I will describe the method for all forms of shifting. By popular request I will
    include not only rapid shift, but my general concept of long term shifting. If
    you know an animal form eligible for the rapid shift, then substitute the word
    "wolf" with "_whatever your animal is_"

- en: There are 2 classes of shift, M and P. As you might already know, M-shift is
    Mental shift, and P-shift is Physical shift. The M-shift is where you induce instinct,
    thought pattern, and the base around which the P-shift is built. The P-shift is
    the actual change of the form of the body. There are 3 different subclasses of
    P-shift. They are Practice, On-Spot, and Long-Term. Before any of these, you must
    achieve an M-shift, and then, the first subclasses available are practice and
    long term. After practice, comes On-Spot, which is the true mastery of the P-shift.
    Long term is not a mastery, but a commitment. If you long term shift, you will
    never again be human, and once you have unlocked it, there is not turning back.
    Now that I have covered the basics, we are ready to proceed to the instructions,
    starting with the M-shift.

    Certain parts and consequences are irreversible. Do not attempt unless you are
    absolutely sure of what you are about to do. I reserve no responsibility for any
    action that you might take. Be aware of my warning. This REALLY WORKS when performed
    as instructed!**'

- en: 'To M-Shift, there is a thing I like to call the 3IA of M-Shifting. Inspiration,
    Investigation, Imagination, Application. Those are all the steps to a successful
    M-Shift. Inspiration: You need to inspire yourself. Keep some pictures or other
    representation of a wolf nearby or with you at all times, and try to keep yourself
    thinking of wolves nonstop. At around the same time, you need to Investigate.
    Investigation: You need to find as much information about wolves as you can, and
    quiz yourself. Make yourself as much of a wolf expert as you can. After you are
    an "expert" you need to use all that knowledge you gathered and imagine it. Imagination:
    You need to draw on the behavior, minds, and instincts of wolves, and simply imagine
    yourself (to the point that you believe it) as a wolf, but not physically, mentally.
    Continue doing this until you are not only a wolf enthusiast and expert, but also
    a wolf at mind, so much that you feel that you are one at points, this means that
    the wolf side has taken over your mind. This is not a switch on and off thing.
    The M-shift is permanent, but it can be controlled so that you can fit in in human
    society. Once you M-shift, your mind is set on a permanent course becoming a wolf
    mind. It is irreversible, and can be set off involuntarily. This will definitely
    change you forever.'

- en: The next stage I will talk about is the Practice P-Shift stage. The alternate
    stage that opts-in here is the Long-Term Shift, which is 2 paragraphs down. The
    starting point of the practice P-shift is completion of the M-shift. Once that
    is complete, you must once again draw on the expert knowledge that you obtained
    in the Investigation part of the M-shift. You need to be able to picture the physical
    aspects of a wolf, AS MUCH AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET, and bring it to mind again.
    You must then use the skill gained in the Imagination part of the M-shift. You
    need to first fire up that wolf mind and relieve all restraints and "release your
    inner wolf" in a sanctuary (somewhere that you can be alone, relaxed, and free
    of all distractions.) Then you need to get relaxed as deeply as possible, and
    gather as much focus as you can on what it would look like and feel like to be
    a wolf for a second, now, fire up that wolf mind all the way until you feel you
    are a wolf again. Now, imagine your human body as "what I would look like IF I
    was a human" and work from that, and how it would feel as a human, and what it
    would look like, then work on to what it would feel and look like to shift into
    a wolf. Imagine it as VIVIDLY as possible using all senses. Keep practicing, it
    might not work the first time, I also recommend focusing on one body part at a
    time as you practice it, because you will get individual parts easier. Eyes, teeth,
    ears, paws, those are the easiest few. The tail comes in just after these. Work
    towards your end goal with PATIENCE. If you are impatient, you will not get any
    results. Usually a full shift takes 2 weeks to 4 months to achieve. It depends
    on the concentration of wolf blood in you, the more you practice, the more concentrated
    it becomes. You definitely don't want 100% though (that only happens after PNR,
    and 3rd degree possession). Once you achieve a shift, I call the point at which
    you shift, the barrier. The barrier is also called the "sneeze" by some, because
    the nature of the barrier is exactly like a sneeze. It begins with a strange sensation
    that rushes across you, and becomes a burst that you cannot control. When you
    reach it, you will feel a sensation like a cozy warm feeling, then a feeling of
    energy surging through you (not painful), that soon becomes a feeling of clenching
    and flexing all over your body, and a strange feeling that everything your body
    is made of is changing. During this, your body involuntarily moved as if you are
    being controlled, and it leaves you helpless to control your own body, this barrier
    lasts anywhere between 5 and 50 seconds. It is important that once you reach the
    barrier, you do not panic, or you will terminate the shift, and nothing will happen.
    You need to just be relaxed as a rock and let the shift take it's course. Once
    you do, you will become a wolf. So at this point it is important to know how to
    shift back. In the first few shifts, falling asleep is usually enough to end it,
    but if you aren't tired, remember that staying a wolf on the first few shifts
    for longer than an hour can result in PNR passing, and being "stuck" forever.
    So the other method is to P-shift back, imagine yourself returning, you might
    need to use more strength and focus the longer you stay. Be aware of that. It
    is a more simple reverse method of P-shifting to turn yourself back.

- en: After the Practice shift, you are ready to work on the On-Spot P-Shift. Take
    note that this one is the one with the highest danger factor for those with possession.
    In this one, you just need to practice fully flaring your m-shift, and focusing
    hard enough to induce a full shift while you are not in controlled circumstances.
    Best methods of training involve doing this while standing up. Practice avoiding
    distractions, flaring your focus, flaring your M-shift, and quickly P-shifting.
    It is important to emphasize focus, and dropping your humanity to the point you
    know you are a wolf on a moments notice. String everything together and practice
    to P-shift on a moments notice in a distracting and stressful environment. That
    is the On-Spot shift.

- en: '***This is long term shifting, it is the shift that you can never return to
    human form, which you can use to become almost any animal, it is not recommended.
    DO NOT EVER ATTEMPT UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO GIVE UP YOUR ENTIRE HUMAN LIFE FOREVER.
    Now that you have been warned, this is just a concept, I cannot guarantee it works,
    because anybody who used it is no longer a human. The data I compiled is well
    passed in archives. It is not a common one, but under study, I find that it could
    work if performed properly. The Long-Term shift is long term in 2 ways. It lasts
    until you die, and it takes a relatively long time to be complete. First, you
    need to have some form of that animal''s genes in you somewhere, and they must
    be in an active cell. You just repeat the actions in the M-shift, and Practice
    P-shift, but in the practice P-shift, you must focus day after day, and expect
    very tiny results. Eventually it will set you on a frictionless course to permanently
    becoming that animal. This one can work for animals of different masses, because
    the time frame allows you to gain or lose significant amounts of mass. This one
    is absolutely irreversible and inevitably results in possession.'
