- en: The most useful method of exorcism against demons is reciting an incantation
    which is detailed and long, it is full of energy, not from the min but form the
    glory given by the gods. This type of incantation is typically used in various
    religions, for example Christianity, this is due to the fact that there is no
    need for possession of magical gifts in order to use the energy which the gods
    provide.

    it uses is so pure that when a demon releases the victim’s body, it will be so
    completely immersed in this energy, it will be obliterated. And secondly, this
    incantation does not need to be adapted to fit the strength or identity of the
    evil spirit, this is because the power of the gods will always exceed that of
    the demon´s.

- en: The magnitude of the incantation is the most obvious disadvantage or this method
    of exorcism; this long formula is not easy to memorize and know by heart. Even
    though each word will over time enrage and weaken the demon, until the end of
    the prayer is reached, the exorcism will not be over. That being said, as soon
    as the first words are uttered, the demon will immediately recognize the incantation,
    it will then do whatever it can to silence whoever is reciting this formula. If
    this is a form of exorcism you want to use, it is important to know the incantation
    by heart, you must have strong resolve and avoid, at all cost being interrupted
    before every last word has been uttered.
