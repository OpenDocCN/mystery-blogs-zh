2.  Burn the dried orange peels in a steel basin to cleanse the room for the ritual.
3.  Mix the orange peel ashes with the above herbs,the rodent ashes and seedless fresh orange juice.
4.  Write the persons name in the paper and tie the ribbon around it.
5.  Spill a little of your blood with the atheme and mix with your magic mixture. Smear a little blood on the paper also(you can't draw enough magic for this spell from yourself without dying so you'll use a demon as a battery).
6.  Draw a magic circle anti-clockwise with the magic mix and brush,adorn the insides with protective runes.
7.  position the candles four sides around the circle.
8.  Light the candle and more orange peels,keep the basin with the dry orange peels in the center.
9.  Stand in the circle and summon the demon by chanting ''shokan oni'' ten times. You will feel its presence. Say the trigger word ''kuro itamio'' and toss the paper into the fire while visualizing the persons face.
