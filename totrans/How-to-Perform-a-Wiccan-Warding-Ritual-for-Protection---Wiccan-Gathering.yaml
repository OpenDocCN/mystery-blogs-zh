    one of the most effective forms of magick, but it can be quite confusing to do
    if you’re a new practitioner. Wiccans have plenty of methods for warding, so which
    method should you go for, and how can you perform that warding ritual?

    will be reflective, offensive, or defensive. Observe your space and decide whether
    to use an energy ward, or a physical ward using enchanted objects. When performing

    You’ll best benefit from warding your home or certain parts of your space if the
    said place gives off uneasy energies. (Think chaos, disorganization, [anxiousness](https://www.wiccangathering.com/wiccan-meditation-for-anxiety/),
    or stress.)

    it. It also means to shoo away something. Hence, it’s not a surprise that a warded
    place gives off feelings of peace, protection, and serenity.

    from going further into your area if they do manage to get in. These wards can
    drain people and lure them into staying away from your spot or completely stop
    forces from attempting to delve deeper into your area.

    usually the last line of defense within warded places. If somebody or some force
    manages to find your spot, and enters it deeply, the defensive wards will do their
    best to keep people away from your space’s core area.
