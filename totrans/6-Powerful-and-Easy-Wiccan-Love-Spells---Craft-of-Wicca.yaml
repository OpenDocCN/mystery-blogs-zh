- en: When it comes to love spells, there are a few different schools of thought.
    Some people believe that you should never cast a spell with the intent to control
    someone’s free will, while others think that any love spell cast with positive
    intent is okay.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I believe in the latter. More love in the world is a net positive and so this
    does not violate the [Wiccan rede](https://craftofwicca.com/what-is-wiccan-law-the-wiccan-rede-explained/).

- en: In this article, we’ll teach you six simple but powerful Wiccan love spells.
    These spells can be used to attract someone new or to re-energize a relationship
    that’s lost its spark.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these spells use ingredients that are easy to find and relatively inexpensive.
    So, whether you’re a seasoned witch or a beginner, you’ll be able to cast them
    successfully.

    that goes into them. Following a spell without understanding these basics will
