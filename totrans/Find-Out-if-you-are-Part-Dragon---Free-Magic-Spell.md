What does it mean if all you see is a volcano floating on the clouds of a hurricane

Nobody is physically part dragon. You could look into otherkin if you feel your spirit is draconic, however. Either way, this spell doesn't seem like it would help. I'd disregard it. If you want to identify as otherkin, you can, but imagining volcanoes isn't going to tell you that.

You are not Dragon! Dragons are astral beings and you are human. No spell will change this fact of reality.

what does it mean if you see a house in the woods with poring rain.

It means nothing other than you have an active imagination and ability to visualise. We cannot be part anything: dragon, werewolf, or anything else. We are all human and will always be so.

You are human, this spell is superfluous.

With this I've tried it and the only thing I see is a campfire with a super blood moon/ lunar eclipse. And I giant red and black wolf staring at me like its trying to tell Me something and I can't figure out what.
