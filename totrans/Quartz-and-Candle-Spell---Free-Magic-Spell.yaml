- en: For this spell you will need a quartz crystal and a candle associated with your
    intent. It is also helpful to perform this spell on a day who's properties are
    associated with your intent, though you don't necessarily have to(I have provided
    a list of candle colors to help you pick one associated with your intent. I have
    also provided a list of the days of the week and their correspondences. Both lists
    are located below.)

- en: Once you have picked the candle best suited to your intent, use the tip of the
    crystal to either write a sentence explaining what you desire or draw a symbol
    associated with your intent into the side of the candle.

- en: Once this is done, light the candle and visualize it glowing with the power
    of your intent. As the candle burns down visualize it releasing your wish and
    sending it out to be fulfilled.

- en: For example, if you were casting this spell for protection, you could wait until
    a Tuesday. Use the crystal to carve a symbol of a shield into the side of the
    candle. Light it and then visualize the candle being filled with protective energies.
    As the candle burns down, visualize it sending out protective energy to either
    protect you or a loved one.
