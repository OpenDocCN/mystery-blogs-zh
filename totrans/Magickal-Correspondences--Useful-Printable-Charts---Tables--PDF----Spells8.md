> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://spells8.com/magical-correspondences-chart/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/magical-correspondences-chart/#0001-01-01)

**Magickal correspondences** are a fundamental concept in many occult practices, serving as a system of symbolic associations that connect different elements of the universe.

They are based on the idea of ‚Äúas above, so below,‚Äù which suggests that there are **meaningful connections between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual).**

Correspondences are used to establish relationships between various elements such as planets, elements, colors, symbols, and more, and are believed to influence and enhance magickal workings, rituals, and spells.

## Magickal Correspondences in Different Traditions

Correspondences are a foundational concept in many magickal systems and traditions.

*   For example, in **Hermeticism**, correspondences are central to the philosophy of ‚ÄúHermeticism,‚Äù which teaches that the universe is a reflection of the divine mind and that there are corresponding links between different levels of reality.
*   In **Wicca**, correspondences are used to align with the cycles of nature and the elements, and to enhance the effectiveness of spells and rituals.
*   In **Kabbalah**, correspondences are intricately woven into the structure of the Tree of Life, a symbolic representation of the universe, and are used in divination and meditation practices.

## History of Correspondences

Many early civilizations, including the Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese, believed in the concept of ‚Äúsympathy‚Äù or ‚Äúsympathetic magic,‚Äù which posited that objects and symbols could affect or influence each other through unseen connections or associations.

In the Western occult tradition, the concept of correspondences was further developed and popularized by influential occultists and philosophers such as **Hermes Trismegistus, Cornelius Agrippa**, and the **Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn** in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The use of correspondences in modern magickal practice, including [Wicca](https://spells8.com/topic/the-wiccan-way/), [Paganism](https://spells8.com/pagan-animism/), and other forms of contemporary witchcraft, has evolved from these historical influences.

Today, many practitioners use charts, tables, and lists of correspondences as reference tools to aid them in their spellwork, rituals, divination, and other magickal practices. These correspondences are often based on a combination of traditional beliefs, personal associations, and intuitive connections with the natural world.

Correspondences can provide valuable insights and guidance in divination practices, helping you to interpret messages and gain deeper insights into their readings.
