Thank you, this was very accurate, though it told me what i already knew

I did it with a big candle though, so i blew it out after a while. Also, help me out on something: the wax that melted beneath it was heart-shaped, could you mail me(no idea how the inbox works) and help interpret that?

heart-shaped wax, it's a positive sign someone feels love for you

Simple outline to candle flame divination. You can use this for anything. The size, colour, movement, even the smoke can be used to decipher an answer to any question.

May I ask what exactly a falling or rising flame looks like?

I suggest doing a google image search of specific candle flames. You should find guides to fire divination which would include more detail and photos. In answer to your question, a rising flame would be your average candle flame. It's steady, not too big or small but strong and bright. A falling flame is a tiny flame like when a candle is about to burn out.
