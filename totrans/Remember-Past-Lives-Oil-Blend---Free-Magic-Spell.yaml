    it is. However when I published the last one I didn't realise that the line-break
    command doesn't work here so the formatting made the instructions impossible to
    follow, and I couldn't edit it nor take it down, so here we are.

- en: Oil blends are useful in a lot of things, ranging from aiding meditation to
    spells and potions. This is here to provide a foundation to your oil blend, after
    that it's up to you to add other oils to suit your purpose. Especially because
    this guide has been made mainly to help otherkin and therian individuals, a one-size-fits-all
    approach doesn't work here.

    If you don''t have something, don''t worry: just find something else with the
    same correspondences, it''ll work just as well. The ingredients for a spell or
    potion are chosen because of what they correspond with, so very rarely will you
    actually need exactly what''s listed in the ingredients. That being said, I''ve
    tried to ensure that the base ingredients for these oils are easy to obtain. There
    are lots of digital herb grimoires online, a few websites I recommend are angelfire.com,
    thewhitegoddess.co.uk, pookapages.com, and themagickalcat.com.'

- en: '*I have the herbs but I don''t have the oil from them!* I''ve often found myself
    in this situation as well, I personally find that it''s hard to find oils for
    herbs often used in cooking, so here''s a quick how-to on making plant fragrant
    oils (this method also works with tea, just so you know). This guide uses fragrant
    oils. Fragrant oils consist of a base oil with little to no scent and an essential
    oil, which is the part that makes the fragrance. Common bases include almond oil,
    canola oil, sunflower oil and olive oil. What I do to get fragrant oils is I fill
    a small(ish) jar about 2/3s of the way with my base oil of choice and then fill
    the rest with whatever herb, flower, or resin I want for my fragrance, close the
    lid, and let it steep from a couple days to a week. After that time has passed,
    I strain out the plant matter, pasteurise* the oil if needed, and then bottle
    it. Voil, fragrant oil ready for all your witchy needs!'

    on your skin, make sure the plant/s it's made from aren't poisonous. If you're
    using other oil blends for this one, they usually list ingredients on the label
    of the bottle. Not sure about wether something is poisonous or not, try googling
    "is [plant] safe to eat?"

- en: Discount stores often sell fragrant oils very cheaply. For anyone in Australia,
    stacks discounts sells 16mL bottles of fragrant oils for $2.00AU, and 50 mL bottles
    for $4.00AU. Tumblr and Pinterest have a lot of information on where to get supplies
    cheaply, some good tags to look through are *budget witchcraft, witch on a budget,*
    and *frugal witch.* Another suggestion is to buy wholesale goods from places like
    eBay. For anyone who's unaware, Spells of Magic also has an online store that
    sells fragrant oils and blends fairly cheaply among other things. **End of General

- en: This guide is geared towards recovering kin memories, however, if you aren't
    otherkin or therian this should work just as well. That being said, I should warn
    you that not all memories will be pleasant, so keep that in mind when you put
    these to use. What you use in your blend will vary from person to person, but
    each of these requires a few essential ingredients, a foundation, if you will.
    However, what you need for your foundation will vary depending on what you intend
    to use your oil blend for, an oil for meditation will need a slightly different
    base than one to invite prophetic dreams, for example. The idea is you make up
    your base and then add oils that are relevant to the life (or aspects of) that
    you want to recall. The measurements specified are just recommendations, feel
    free to tweak them as you will.

    hard to find plants that correspond with certain animals and other creatures,
    and partly because there's too many different kin-types to just make a list of
    suggestions based in each kin-type. That being said, if you don't already have
    a selection of oils in mind, you'll need a jumping-off point, so here we go.
  prefs: []

- en: The most obvious thing that comes to mind is plants that have a pre-existing
    correspondence with your kin or therian type, such as catnip for a cat-therian
    or dragons blood for dragonkin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That last thing isn't always easy nor always an option, so the next step would
    be to find oils that *you* associate with your kin-type. I mean this on the most
    basic level, like a ghostkin person may associate roses with their kin-type, possibly
    because people lay roses on peoples' graves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You want to tailor your blend to be as specific to the life you're trying to
    recall as possible. In this case even vague memories of that life could come in
    handy. Another suggestion along this vein would be to include oils that you associate
    not just with that kin-type but that life. Remember certain colours, try plants
    of that colour. Remember certain plants, try those plants. A particular climate,
    plants that can grow in those conditions. Plants that grow in the types of places
    you remember. Remember a country, try their national flower. Something that might
    be useful is that fragrance blends are often used to refresh potpourri, so you
    might be able to find blends that you associate with certain places, such as an
    ocean-themed blend for oceanic kin-types, etcetera.
