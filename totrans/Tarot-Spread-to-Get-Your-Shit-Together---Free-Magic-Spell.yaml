    where you can perform the spread. Make sure it's comfy enough for you and that
    the surface is flat enough that it won't make the cards slip around as you place
    them down.

    the cards. Focus on the general state of the situation you are in or are dealing
    with. When you shuffle, note that there is no right way other than that the faces
    of the cards should not be showing and that you'll know you're done when it feels
    right for you.
