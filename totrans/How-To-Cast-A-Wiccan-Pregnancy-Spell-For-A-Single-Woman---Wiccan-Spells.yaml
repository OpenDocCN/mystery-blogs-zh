    and fertility, with the goal of aiding a single woman in conceiving a child. These
    spells draw upon the principles of Wicca, a neo-pagan religion that embraces the
    belief in nature’s inherent power and the interconnection of all things. While
    these spells cannot guarantee pregnancy, they can serve as a spiritual tool to
    enhance your intention and manifest your desire for motherhood.
