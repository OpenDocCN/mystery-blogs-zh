You can use cleansing herbs like sage smoke to cleanse your home while calling on Dragons for further assistance, but the ''chant'' is just gibberish. Write your own chant calling on Dragons and this will work.

I think that is easy to tell

Be careful with sage. White sage, especially sage smudging, is exclusive to indigenous culture and should not be used by non-natives. And being 1/18 Cherokee princess does not count. There are other cleansing herbs and bundles you can use, but sage smudge is different from a smoke cleanse. As for the chant, it is fake. As Neko suggested above, find a chant that works for you and use that. Heck, you could omit this entire spell, bless your lemon scented floor cleaner, and chant as you are washing your floors. It might surprise some, but that can count as a cleansing too. Not as potent, but good for washing away your daily negative gunk.
