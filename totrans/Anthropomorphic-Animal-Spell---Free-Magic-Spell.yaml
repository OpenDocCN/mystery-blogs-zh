    far left of the silver candle, and the brown to the far right, so it makes an

    to it; you can't just stop shifting. Now focus on every feature of it. Imagine
    the changes appearing on you. Imagine being this anthropomorphic animal. Keep
    focusing until you are sure. It's good if you feel, either beforehand or as you
    concentrate, that you ARE this anthro. That it is you, and you are it.

- en: Now focus on the energy of you melding with the anthro's energy. Imagine changing
    rapidly, fur or feathers growing in as you change to match the picture, then shifting
    back to human. Imagine orbs or pools of energy filling you, and as they do, you
    turn into the anthro wherever they touch. Concentrate on this for a while, then
    carve pentagrams into the candles in the same order you lit them, then cut your
    finger and drip your blood onto the candles in the same order. Now take the silver
    pen and draw a pentagram on the back of the picture, before dividing it into approximate
    fifths, as equal as you can get. Burn a piece on each candle, then snuff them
    out with the ashes.
