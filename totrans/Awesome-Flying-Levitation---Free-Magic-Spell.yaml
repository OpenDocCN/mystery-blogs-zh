    me to the stars, fly me to the moon, I shall float up there, but bring me down
    when I say, ( )".

    care about what other people say, I do have a fairy friend and say I'm delirious
    but i am not. They can't be photographed and the king has banished them from coming
    into human contact as unfortunately an incident happened many moons ago. Leave
    these creators alone, thank you.

    which you simply can not do unless you get in a plane or other flying invention.

- en: I would only state things I am absolutely sure of such as this, you cannot fly
    with Magic. You probably watched a stage magician use an illusion to trick the
    observer into seeing levitation/flight when in reality they did not. That is how
    stage magic works, it is called misdirection. You cannot physically fly. If it
    was possible in any way, I would have said so, but it is not, hence why I said
    it with 100% conviction it is not possible. If you saw someone fly, I suggest
    getting your eyes checked, Magic is an energy, it gives the energy around us a
    specific charge to bring a desired change into our lives. It works with nature.
    It does not change the physical in such an unnatural way.

- en: This has absolutely nothing to do with the Fae. This is a spell claiming you
    can fly by holding a dandelion and saying you want to fly. I have worked with
    the Fae for most of my life, many of them live around my home, nobody is denying
    the existences of fairys and other nature spirits of their kind. They are not
    physical beings, nor can you become one, but you certainly can work with them.
