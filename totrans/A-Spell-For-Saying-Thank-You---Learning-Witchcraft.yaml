- en: It is best to cast a spell that expresses gratitude on a Monday when the moon
    is full or waxing during Pisces. Wear white clothes to reinforce the thanks that
    you are offering. Even if the spell is cast without any apparent effect, casting
    these types of spells is still the right thing to do, since you always need to
    remember that it takes time for magic to work.

    for all of the gifts that you have been given. Then light your silver candle,
    stand up to your complete height, and bring your hands over your head high and
