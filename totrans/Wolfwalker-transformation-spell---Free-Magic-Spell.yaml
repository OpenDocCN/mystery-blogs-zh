    explain it, please.

- en: The user who made this isn't around anymore [they deleted their account] but
    I assume they're referring to the belief you should memorize spells. Many witches
    believe it's better to memorize the spell/chants before casting so you don't keep
    pausing to find your place. Personally, you should read over the spell a few times
    so you know what it says, but if you still read it off a piece of paper, that's
    fine. So long as you're not reading it for the first time and go ''All I have
    is... In... Incom... *googles word*'' you should know what the chant means. Otherwise,
    there's no conviction behind your words, the energy is weak, and there will be
    gaps in the magick.

    a dreamscape type transformation, it still does not work. The chant makes no sense,
    and there is no Magik behind the chant.
