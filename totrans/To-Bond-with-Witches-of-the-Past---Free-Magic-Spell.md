*   13 t-light candles

*   Incense (of your own choice)

*   Bread/Roll/Bun

## Casting Instructions for 'To Bond with Witches of the Past'

 Set up your altar as you wish in a room where there is a window looking at the Full moon as it rises (Or perform this outside if the weather permits. Your altar should be simple enough to have room for the offerings. Set up any meditative music you think may help. Infront of the altar start forming a circle with the 13 candles. the diameter should be wide enough so that in the center of the circle you can sit with your meditation pillow.

When ready, Light the altar candles and invoke the gods you associate with the arts of witchcraft, such as Apollon, Herne, Vainimoinen, Bast, Cerridwyn or Hekate. Follow this up with the following:

"God/dess _______, To you I pray. Here I am. On this holy night I ask of thee. Bless this circle and myself with your powers and your grace. And at the same time, bring to me the wisdom and understanding of those witches that lived before me. Help open my mind and with the guiding power of the full moon bless me." Follow this up by lighting the incense and offer it to the god/s. Then follow this us by offering the bread, salt and libation. By this time you should feel divine presence near you.

After a short pause of divine thanks start lighting the candles about you, one at a time. With each candle you light speak the following: "Guiding light, witch's sight. Bring me the wisdom of ancient witches this night."

When done, sit down in the circle on your pillow or seat. Take a few deep breaths and speak the following: "Divine ______, god/dess of the mystic and magical arts. Guardian of witches past and present, to you I pray. On the bright full moon night I ask you to help me understand the arts of those witches that have come before me. And if you so deem, help me in the quest to be the best witch I can be. Not powerful but wise. Grant me this I ask, on this full moon night."

Pause

"Priests of Shamans of the most earliest of times, Astrologers of Assyrian night skies, priests and priestesses of ancient Aegyptiam sands, Oracles of the temples of Hellas, Witches and Wizards of times gone by. I ask of these, send me any powerful words of wisdom, any gifts of understanding, any powers that you may wish to lend me. So that I can carry on the proud and noble arts of Magic and witchcraft from your time to my time. Give me the understanding of what it means to be a witch. This I ask humbly of thee."

Now slip into a meditative state. Think back, project the mind to times gone past, to the inner temples and caves of the past. See and wonder as you see these shamans and witches perform their rites of magic and paganism. Hear their words and watch their arts. Remember them if you can. Do not rush this meditative process. Stay with it as long as possible. At least till the t-lights burn out (which is about 2 hours) The images you see should look not like a movie but like you are actually there. Refrain from inducing images from TV shows and movies, as these are not real and only confuse you. Let the images come to you. You should not only be able to see whats being shown but feel the ground and smell the air.

When done thanks the gods most respectfully. You may now wish to record any visions you had and wish to remember in a journal book. When done recording what need be, blow out the candles. Never snuff them out with your fingers as this is disrespectful. As you blow out each candle speak "With loves sweet kiss."

The rite is now done. You may wish to perform this each full moon as you feel you are in training. Each time you perform this, you should gain new insight and at the same time feel the witch inside you grow stronger.
