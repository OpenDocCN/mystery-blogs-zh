    Add your 1 tbsp of dirt to represent the north. Heat up the bottom of your red
    candle to stick it to the bottom of your next shot glass to represent the south.
    Leave your last shot glass empty to represent air. And you don't need a shot glass
    for spirit. Simply use your own energy to fill for this.

    can use this. Starting at the east: "I call upon thee oh glorious air that fills
    my lungs and flows through the trees" Light your red candle and say: "I call upon
    thee element of fire that shines so bright and warms my soul" Water: "I call upon
    thee element of water who''s beauty created the oceans" Earth: "I call upon thee
    element of earth who''s strong force teaches us and provides to us". Spirit: "I
    call upon thee spirit acne manifest you here so I may give thanks to you for making
    me whole"'

- en: If you're using an offering, offer whatever it is to each element. Once you're
    no longer in need of your circle, release each element starting from spirit to
    air saying "I release thee (element) go if you must, stay if you like" then end
    it however you wish.
