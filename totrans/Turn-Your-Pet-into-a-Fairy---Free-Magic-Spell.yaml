    items for this spell:** Take one treat out and set it down on some surface. Kiss
    two fingers on your hand like a "peace" sign, and put your fingers on the treat.
    Then, pet your pet three times. After that, say, "Listen here, listen here, fairies
    are for real. Good boy/girl, good boy/girl, now eat this fairy treat", and give
    them the treat.'

    to complete and the wings to fully grow. Simple, right? To teach your pet to fly,
    I recommend holding a toy or treat above them so they jump to get it. (S)he will
    probably be a bit nervous to fly at first, but once they get used to fluttering
    about, they most likely won't be able to stop!

    are real. I have worked with them for many years, however, they are spirits; Astral
    beings. You can work with them, befriend them, but you cannot transform yourself
    or other physical beings into them. Furthermore, I am not attacking you. You stated
    your opinion, I am explaining my comment. Whether or not you choose to accept
    the reality of Magic is entirely up to you. Nobody, myself included, is about
    to demand you conform. We post these, as people claim, ''negative'' comments,
    not to bully or hurt people, but to educate and inform. Real Magic is not the
    same as Hollywood fantasy magic. Research and discover this for yourself.

    is a dog they should stay a dog not a fairy or mermaid or vampire etc, if it worked
    anyways same goes for all animals they were born that way and should stay that
    way sure if they went up to you and said ''I want to be a fairy make me one''
    then sure try and make timmy the turtle a fairy but i doubt that happened so please
    dont do that.
