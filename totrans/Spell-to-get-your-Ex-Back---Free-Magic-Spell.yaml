    with the salt. Place the five candles around you, placing them on each point on
    the circle as if putting them on the points of a pentagram. Put the photo of your
    ex in the middle of the circle, and place the white candle next to it. Focus hard
    on the picture of your ex, and imagine a white light pouring down through the
    top of your head, through your body, exiting your body through your heart and
    entering the photo of your ex. See this light cleansing and healing the bond between
    you. Repeat the following incantation three times: **“I invoke thee, Aphrodite,
    goddess of love,'

    every night of the week after a new moon.

    for a reason. Why would someone want back together when at least one party in
    the relationship was miserable, angry, cheating, who knows what? If the spell
    works, it traps the two back together -- against the will of one, and resulting
    in their mental anguish. That seems extremely selfish to me.
