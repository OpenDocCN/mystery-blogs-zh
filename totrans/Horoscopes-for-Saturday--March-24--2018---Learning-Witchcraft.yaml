- en: The Sun links with your ruling planet Mars on your birthday this year, which
    means your energy levels will be high and your ambitions even higher. What you
    need to remember though is that life is not a war. Make friends and allies, not
    enemies.

- en: It may seem as if fate is conspiring to frustrate your desires but it isn’t
    true. More likely you are sabotaging yourself by sending out negative thought
    waves that attract negative results. You’ve got to be positive if you want to
    be lucky.

- en: It will pay you to find out what other people think about your plans this weekend
    – their input could be invaluable. If you push ahead regardless you may find there
    is something you have overlooked – and you will look pretty silly as well!

- en: A setback of some kind will make you realize that you have been taking too much
    for granted, especially on the work front where you seem to believe that your
    natural brilliance will attract big rewards with not much effort. Time to get
    real.

    that are not at least partially backed up by the facts you could end up losing
    friends and maybe losing money too. Think before you speak and act.

- en: You will be in the spotlight over the next 48 hours and while it may not be
    a pleasant experience it will at least push you to give more of yourself, emotionally
    and intellectually. Don’t hide in the shadows. Let your natural light shine.

    own ends, but don’t make too big a deal of it. If anything you should feel flattered
    that they rate you so highly they want to make use of your name.

    it is and maybe it isn’t but you do need to be aware that there will be consequences
    further down the line. What goes around always comes around eventually.

    then you must speak up about it. You may in fact have no choice but to go over
    their head and appeal to those in positions of power. Don’t wait – act now.

    it. Cosmic activity in your opposite sign means you feel as if you are at the
    mercy of events, but you still have friends and some of them can assist you.

    that some of those people will annoy you. You’re smart enough to know that sometimes
    you have to bite your tongue and say nothing. This is one of those times.

    when dealing with people who have the power to upset your plans. Be dynamic this
    weekend but try to keep it low-key so you don’t draw too much attention to yourself.

    on the charm. You may be tempted to strong arm your way to success but that will
    create more problems than it solves. Try persuading others to work with you.
