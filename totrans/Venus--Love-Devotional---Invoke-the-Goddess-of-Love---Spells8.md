> 来源：[https://spells8.com/venus-devotional/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/venus-devotional/#0001-01-01)

Venus is the Roman goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, widely revered in ancient Rome for her influence over romantic and aesthetic domains. She is also celebrated as the mother of the Trojan hero Aeneas, linking her directly to the mythological origins of Rome itself.

Venus was also identified with the Etruscan goddess Turan, borrowing qualities from her and Aphrodite. Additionaly, she was equivalent to Summerian goddess Inanna, and Phoenician goddess Astarte, among others.

O Venus, beauty of the skies,

To whom a thousand temples rise,

Gaily shine in gentle smiles,

Full of love-perplexing wiles;

O goddess, from my heart remove

The wasting cares and pains of love.

If you ever have kindly heard

A song in soft distress preferred,

Propitious to my tuneful vow,

A gentle goddess, hear me now.

Descend, you bright immortal guest,

In all your radiant charms confessed.

Dear Venus, I beg you to light my path

and break the chains that isolate me,

so that no obstacle can get in the way.

I ask you to open my heart to love so that I can smile again.

Rid any negative thoughts that may be in my mind,

in my body or in my emotions.

Give me the chance to love and be loved.

To feel illusion and thrill inside of me.

Give me the blessing of a true love to share sorrow and joy.

A stable and serious, a real love.

A pure love that is reciprocated,

full of friendship and respect.

I ask you to help me in this, my most intimate desire.

Mother of love, Mother of light, please grant me clarity so that I know how to find

A twin flame who will give me all their love.

Who wishes to be my faithful partner and with whom I can have a long-lasting union.

What my heart most hopes will happen,

Make happen; join forces on my side!

Celestial visitant, once more

Your needful presence I implore.

In pity come, and ease my grief,

Bring my distempered soul relief,

Favour your suppliant’s hidden fires,

And give me all my heart desires.

Come then now, dear goddess, and release me

From my anguish. All my heart’s desiring

Grant me now. Now too again as aforetime,

Be my ally.

Come to me once more, and abate my torment;

Take the bitter care from my mind, and give me

All I long for; Lady, in all my battles

Fight as my comrade.

So it is now, so mote it be.
