    ask a Christian saint for help first. Perhaps you simply want to work with demons
    instead? It is possible, you just need to do your research first to be safe.

    by a demon, but demons are manipulators who will help you in exchange for what
    they want, I find it funny getting possessed by a demon would be the thing you
    need to put a spring in your step.

- en: If the pain you are feeling is a headache. That is actually self-induced. You
    are feeling the presence of the demon but you are subconsciously fighting yourself
    because of the newness of the feeling to you. Just relax.

    ritual. This is more of a means to introduce yourself to demons.

    can choose to work with Lucifer, but this sounds like the person does not understands
    Satanism.

- en: You chose to post a spell and I responded. I am not being mean towards you,
    I am simply stating facts to help new members. If you did not know about Satanism
    or work with Lucifer, why post a spell invoking him? If you are so new you do
    not know how to work with demons and certain deities, you should not have posted
    a spell. Other new members will see it and assume you posted a real spell. Again,
    I am being direct, not mean. If you wish to work with Lucifer or Satan, I suggest
    researching their mythology, as well as groups who work with them. The Satanic
    Temple uses the symbol but not does not deify either being. Spiritual Satanists
    would work with them as well as Luciferian witches.
