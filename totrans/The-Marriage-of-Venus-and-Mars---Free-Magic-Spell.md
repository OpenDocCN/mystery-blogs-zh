 Add one drop of your chosen essential oil to the carrier oil and place it on the altar with the other material you are going to use.

Kneel in front of the altar. Light the white candle and meditate quietly in front of it. Now take one of the pink candles and very carefully use the knife or burin to carve the symbol of Venus at the top of the candle. Put it back in it's holder, then rub some of the oil into your hands. Now dress the inscribed candle, drawing the oil towards you and visualizing that you are empowering the candle with your desire.

Once the candle has been annointed, and still visualizing, rub your hands together, keeping the candle between your palms. After a minute or two, when you feel that the candle is properly empowered, put it back in it's holder and take the second pink candle and carve the symbol of Mars at the top. Anoint it as you did the first one, rub it between the palms of your hands then put it back in the holder.

Now light both pink candles and say:
"Love to me I pray you bring
But the power of love so true
Fill my heart so it does sing,
Rejoice and let me love anew.
And it harm none, so be it"

Watch the pink candles burn down and when the flames flicker and die bring the ritual to an end in the usual way.
