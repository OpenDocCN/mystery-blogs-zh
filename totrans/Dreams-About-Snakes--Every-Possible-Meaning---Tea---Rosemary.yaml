    whether this is a person (your boss, your mother, your partner, etc.), or a situation
    (making a commitment, going on a trip, having to face something). If your dream
    about snakes was related to fear, then the message is that it’s time to turn around
    and face the situation.'

    are very common. The snake itself can represent your anxiety, or it can indicate
    that your emotions are out of whack and that you’re trying to pretend that your
    anxiety doesn’t exist. Again, the message is to dig deep and figure out what’s
    causing the anxiety instead of ignoring it.'

    to reach your goals.'
  prefs: []

    warning is that you should be cautious around people in your life. You may have
    a “snake” around you who you blindly trust, but you should dig deeper to see what
    their true intentions are. The second kind of warning is that you’re ignoring
    something in your subconscious mind and you must acknowledge the truth.'

    In this context, a dream about snakes can mean that you’re trying to find the
    answers to a problem or learn something new.'

    repressed desires. This dream is a sign to face your desires and deal with them
    instead of continuing to repress them. Reconsider what you think you want. Is
    there something you want that you’re scared to admit to yourself?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    trauma. The snake represents things that have been repressed in the unconscious
    mind and is a sign that you need to access your inner child/shadow self. Usually,
    the snake represents a *part* of you that you’re hiding.'

    an energy from the snake that correlates with someone you know? If so, look into
    the meaning of being chased by that person and why that would make you feel afraid.

    snake *did* represent. Is there a situation in your life that you’re avoiding?
    Is there something you need to turn around and face?

    but you have been avoiding this. If you are running away from something, your
    subconscious mind is sending you a message that this won’t continue to work.

    that you need to turn around and face your fear. It’s ideal if you’re able to
    do this in real life, once you figure out what the snake represents.

    the snake. You can also sleep with protection crystals or sigils for strength
    under your pillow to help you face the situation.

    The goal is to figure a way out of the situation, but you can’t do this unless
    you first face your fears.

    have overcome an obstacle in your life, or that you’re close to the conclusion
    of a difficult situation.

    if it feels impossible.

    about what it could represent. Did you see the snake as a person or as a part
    of your own consciousness? What are you afraid of losing?

    without hurting anyone, or it can mean that you’re trying to “kill” your repressed
    trauma/shadow self.

    It’s not only anxiety-producing but can also be straight up hard. Many of our
    dreams are filled with obscure metaphors.

    the emotions positive or negative? Were you afraid, angry, joyous, revengeful,
    or calm?
  prefs: []

- en: Negative feelings usually indicate that a threat is present in your life. This
    can be a person, a situation, or your own thoughts. If you encounter a deity or
    spirit in your dreams about snakes, then you may feel afraid or negative because
    the being is so powerful.

- en: Feeling fear in a dream is quite common. Most of the time, fear is an indication
    that you need to dig deeper and face your trauma. However, fear can also be a
    warning sign that you need to be careful of someone or something in real life.
    I recommend doing some divination to figure out which type of message you’re getting.
  prefs: []

- en: Positive feelings usually mean that you’re turning over a new leaf or are about
    to achieve a goal. Snakes represent change, so if you feel happy, joyous, or peaceful
    in your dream, know that transformation is either happening or is about to happen.

    especially before you had the dream. Sometimes, your subconscious mind or guides
    will send you a message based on your own preconceived notions.

    your own fear or something in your life that is creating fear.

    what your dream means (and for additional confirmation), but you should first
    begin by examining your gut instincts about the meaning. Remember that the answers
