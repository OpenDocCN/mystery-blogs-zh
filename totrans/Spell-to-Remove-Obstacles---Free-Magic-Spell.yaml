    \ you can move forward this is probably due to some unresolved issues in your\
    \ life. Working towards forgiveness, purpose, acceptance, responsibility, are\
    \ all difficult tasks. What we need to remember is that while we might not be\
    \ responsible for the outside things that affect us, or the things other people\
    \ do to us.. but we are responsible for how we react to the situation. This is\
    \ a powerful spell to combat these unresolved issues but you have to be ready\
    \ to move forward and move on. This spell\N is about release. You may cry, you\
    \ may yell, but you will also heal, release and move forward. Do this spell during\
    \ the full moon or the waning moon."

    this you will feel weak and emotionally drained. You may want to go to sleep after
    this process. If you still are battling with the pain of the past you may repeat
    this process as often as needed.
