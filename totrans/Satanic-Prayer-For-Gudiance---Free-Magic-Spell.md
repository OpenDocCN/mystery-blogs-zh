 ## Casting Instructions for 'Satanic Prayer For Gudiance'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** "Teach me, Lord Satan, the knowledge of the ages
Guide me in thy wisdom
Let me feel thy presence and experience what you have for me
Dont let me be bound by irrefutable doctrines
But lead me to true freedom

Give me the strength to leave my comfort zone
To explore that which is forbidden by those who believe they are wise
Take away the fear that binds me
Set me on my true path
But if you dont think I am ready, let it be as a sunrise

Allow me to see your light as well as your darkness
The fullness of who you are
Satan, Melek Taus, Lucifer, Azazel
If I could have anything, it would be to know your truth
To believe in what is real
Not in someone elses insanity

So as I walk down this narrow road
Dont let me be discouraged
As it is you who have placed me upon it"

I have a feeling this works after I tried I felt a presence and It felt comforting

I do not work with Satan or Lucifer, but this does seem like a genuine prayer and therefore should work if you work with him.
