    old or irrelevant. Books also serve as excellent guides for whatever your practice
    needs.

    than a sheet of paper with scribbled notes on it or my phone. *Shudder.* I hate
    technology being around when trying to connect with nature or the divine.

    but Amazon these days.

    for things like “pagan bookstore” “Wiccan store” or “occult shop” should bring
    up anything nearby.

    them if you have the money. They tend to carry a lot of supplies you can’t find

    different from mine. I guarantee it!
