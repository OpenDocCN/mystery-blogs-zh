Anny you desire, I'm guessing...

This spell doesn't work. While item enchantment is real, it doesn't work like it does in fiction. An enchanted book isn't going to blast people away from it.

You cannot enchant an object to blast someone away if they touch it. Blessing items are done because you plan to use them in your craft. You could bless a pen with love energy and use it to write petitions, sigils and spells associated with love. This would give it extra Magik. You can enchant a book with an invisibility spell so people overlook it on bookshelves thus protecting your secrets. You cannot enchant a book to do anything not naturally possible.
