- en: Mars is a popular planet that’s studied by beginner through advanced astrologists.
    It’s surprisingly complex, and represents much more than the initial keywords
    that we’re taught; “drive,” “anger,” and “passion” are only the beginning of the
    planet Mars.

- en: 'Mars in Libra is especially interesting, because it’s the exact opposite of
    what Mars should be. Aries is typically paired with Mars: they have similar qualities
    as we often think of both being outgoing, bold, and action-driven.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Libra is the exact opposite of Aries, so it is the opposite of Mars in many
    ways as well. While Mars is active and driven, Libra is passive; Mars is brash
    and blunt, Libra is diplomatic; Mars will pick a fight over anything, but Libra
    will always find a way to passively fight behind closed doors.

    the best of both, if they’re able to use the energy for good.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main characteristics that Mars shows are one’s drive and ambition, one’s
    temper, how one pushes through career and conducts themselves in the workplace,
    and the manner in which a person will be attracted to others and interact in romance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Mars in Libra have an extremely passive nature, which can often mean
    that their drive to get things done and achieve their goals is not as great as
    Mars in other signs. They tend to let things decide themselves instead of exerting
    their will.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest drive for Mars in Libra is usually to have others around them. While
    this will depend on the house and aspects, those with Mars in Libra typically
    feel that they need a partner, group, or family in order to put forward their
    best selves. They will generally have less drive in traditional areas (such as
    work, school, etc.) and will have a bigger drive for social interactions.
  prefs: []

    in any other area as long as they have sufficient social or material motivation.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Mars in Libra don’t have much of an outward temper. When they are
    angry (an emotion they definitely feel), they might become passive-aggressive.
    In some cases, Mars in Libra can be extremely polite and fair, even to their own
    detriment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These folks can be very world justice-oriented, and this is one of the few times
    that they’ll show outward anger. Only when standing up for a cause that both *looks
    good* and *is actually moral* are Mars in Libra willing to show rage!
  prefs: []

- en: Surprisingly, this placement makes for individuals who are great at managing
    conflict. This definitely isn’t the typical placement for Mars, as conflict is
    usually the name of the game with this planet,  but in the case of a typical Martian
    fight, you’ll actually want a Mars in Libra there to manage it. These people are
    extremely diplomatic and know how to handle a variety of personality types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Mars in Libra will strive for a life without turmoil, and with moderate-to-good
    aspects, they are often able to achieve that. When they do feel angry, it’s rare
    for them to actually show it, and only those closest to them will see it.

    I met a Mars in Libra person who didn’t resort to subterfuge at least some of
    the time.
  prefs: []

    has negative emotions, and in Mars in Libra people they have to go somewhere.
    Anger usually comes out sideways in the Mars in Libra placement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and have trouble expressing themselves on a consistent basis.

    the very least, you generally need another person to work with since Libra is
    a sign of duality.

    uninspired at work, you’ll feel more drained than usual. Mars in Libra picks up
    energy off of others, so the work atmosphere is really important.

    in my experience, I’ve seen that they tend towards consulting, philanthropy, hospitality,
    beauticians, and even receptionists. The opportunities really are endless, but
    most individuals with Mars in Libra like to use their combination of charm and
    beauty to their advantage.

    They love to champion the underdog and find motivation in the motive. This is
    true for both the Mars in Libra woman and the Mars in Libra man: I don’t find
    that gender plays much of a factor in drive, although the house and other aspects
    in one’s personal chart might.'

    people.

    Just as Mars in Libra might fight in a passive aggressive manner, with malefic
    aspects, they can quickly become manipulative towards their partner. It can be
    tough for these folks to get their point across, so it’s easy for them to feel
    trapped in a relationship, even if it’s their own doing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Mars in Libra probably enjoy sex, but might find that the expectation
    of intimacy and romance in their head is often grander than the real thing. They
    do want everything to be balanced, even in bed, so they’ll be sure to pay attention
    to their partner and aim to please as long as that is reciprocated. They can definitely
    be a little picky about *how* things happen and need the *perfect* atmosphere,
    build up, etc. in order to get in the mood.
  prefs: []

    consideration, a Mars in Libra individual will suddenly be super giving and attentive.

    in yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    right to voice their authentic opinions.

    and is often too blunt.
  prefs: []
