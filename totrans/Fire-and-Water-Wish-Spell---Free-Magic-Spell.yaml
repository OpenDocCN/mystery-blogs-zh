    higher/stronger.

    or a color associated with your wish. For example, if your wish is related to

- en: 1\. Make sure that you are still doing things to help with the spell. For example,
    if your wish is to have a job interview, apply to jobs! If your wish is for your
    crush to notice you, wear a nice outfit! If your wish is to get stronger physically,
    work out.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I did this spell about four nights in a row until I got a job interview at the
    company I wanted! At first, I kept getting job interviews after job interviews
    at places that turned out to be a wrong fit or farther than I expected. If you
    don't get your desired results, keep trying! For me, that meant I had to keep
    applying to jobs and keep spell-casting, even when I was REALLY tired of the smell
    of burned hair.

    words, "I have a job interview" quietly no matter where I was, throughout the
    day.
