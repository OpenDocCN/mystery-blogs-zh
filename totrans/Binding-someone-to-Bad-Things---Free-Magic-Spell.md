**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Black Candle

*   Black cord/rope (you HAVE to have this)

*   Picture of the person/ Name on piece of paper

 If you want to bind someone to just on thing like illnesses thatÂs cool, but if youÂd like to bind them to different things at the same time, get the rope and name what it is you want and tie a knot and keep going. Like ÂdeathÂ tie a knot, ÂaccidentsÂ tie a knot, Â Messed up relationshipsÂ tie a knot.

Alright, take a deep breath. Light the candle. Imagine the person in that ÂaccientÂ see them crying, bleeding etc or if you donÂt wanna do all that just see them sad, crying, depressed, saying Âmy life is hellÂ or something. Have fun with it. Hold that for a while then feel joy fill your soul, Âcause it already happened. Get the rope and bind the picture/Name and say Â I Bind you______, I bind you to (accidents, illnesses, financial problemsÂ after your done, IÂd burn the binding to ashes and bury them but if you canÂt bury itÂREAL DEEP!

* You could invoke spirits if youÂd like but personally I wouldnÂt cause I would want myself destroying them not me and a spirit.

* You could also, if it makes more sense to you, get a piece of paper and write the bad thing you want to bind the person too or get a symbol of that thing and bind them to it.
