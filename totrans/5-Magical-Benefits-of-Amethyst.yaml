    spells. Their energy is connecting whatever desire is behind your spell or ritual
    to the higher realms. They can work well in unconditional love spells or talismans,
    cleansing baths and soaks or manifestation candle magick.

    shades makes them a great companionship for meditation. During your next meditation,
    simply place one in front of you or hold one in the palms of your hands and let
    it help to bring clarity, focus, and inner peace. Amethyst is also beneficial
    for healing both energetic and emotional issues. Place it on the affected, or

    or as a part of magical wands. This can be a great option if you are bit more
    on the crafty side. (well, you can still buy them, if you are not) But using amethyst
    as a tool can be as simple as getting one shaped as a point and use it as a wand.
