    photo, First and Last name, date of birth if known (don''t have to know both),
    and that one loves the other using their names (e.g. John loves Jane and visa
    versa).  Lay the photos side by side face up and sprinkle the sugar over them
    while repeating the following:'

    "Spirits of the Earth, keep these two grounded that they may enjoy each others
    company in solitude."

    saying "Spirits of the Water, take these two into your cool embrace that they
    may flow with each others energy forever."
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take the photos and roll them into a half circle to cup the ingredients that
    spilled out during sprinkling and light the photos on fire (making sure you have
    a safe place to do this so as not to hurt yourself and to let them burn safely). 
    Say this while watching them burn "Spirits of Fire and Air, carry with you these
    intentions that this couple will be able to live out their passion without obstacle."

- en: 'Tips: With the sugar, sprinkle it lightly.  You don''t need to much and the
    more you use the less likely the photos are to stick to each other.  Same with
    the rose petals.  There is some debate in my circle as to whether a Red or Pink
    candle should be used, I personally prefer Red.  The wordings used are not necessarily
    written in stone, personalize each one if you feel it.  The more you change it
    to fit your style the more powerful the spell can become.  I just happened to
    like the phrasing from the original photo spell and just added the names before
    it for greater affect.  And lastly, this spell will work better if 1) The two
    people know each other, 2) If they were already together at one point / Still
    have feelings for each other, 3) If at least one of the people have requested
    the spell be done.'
