## Classical Hermit Card Tarot Interpretation

The classical meaning of The Hermit tarot card can be seen in the Rider-Waite deck.

 He carries a lantern in his right hand; it is the Seal of Solomon, a sign of knowledge. The lantern illuminates The Hermit’s route as he walks, but just for a few steps rather than the entire journey.

 He must take the first step forward, understanding that not everything will be disclosed at once. The Hermit has a lengthy staff (a symbol of his strength and authority), of the inner self, which he utilizes to direct and steady himself.

He also has a strong devotion to his aim and a clear understanding of the route he is on. A six-pointed star, popularly known as the Seal of Solomon, may be found inside the lantern. This sign is associated with knowledge. He wields a staff that denotes authority and strength.

 ### Upright Hermit Card Meaning

The upright Strength card has a straightforward meaning:

 **The upright Hermit card represents that you need to be alone for now. Take a break from your daily routine to focus your time and efforts within and locate the answers you’re looking for within your core self. The Hermit indicates a time to look within.**

You’re thinking about how much you ought to be alone right now. Never be hesitant to take advantage of this opportunity to reflect, as it may help you rid your mind of the baggage that accompanies with daily living.

The Hermit might also allude to your efforts to live a life that is genuine and true to yourself. Perhaps you’re looking to your true self for advice on what’s proper and what your next actions should be.

 It might also be a sign of celibacy or virginity. The Hermit upright might signify an older, wiser partner in a partnership. It might also indicate that you should put in more effort to bond with your partner. It might mean you and your lovers are more concerned with doing your own thing than making memories together.

 You may be realizing that wealth does not offer you satisfaction at the moment. This might be a moment when you put less emphasis on material things and instead try to figure out where you can actually find fulfillment.

The meaning is easy to remember by just reading some of the upright card keywords off of the symbols:

 *   Hermit = isolation, alone with yourself
*   Lantern = guidance coming from self
*   Staff = stability without the need for others
*   Bowed head = contemplation

Because The Hermit’s overarching subject is spiritual awakening, now is an excellent time to indulge in spiritual pursuits.

You are entering a period of amazing spiritual growth, whether it be through meditation, astral work, or intuitive development.

 You could find yourself desiring solitude or isolation in some way. However, you should devote this time to developing your mind and spirit and allowing yourself to follow your innate direction, as it will be extremely beneficial to you spiritually.

### Reversed Hermit Card Meaning

Reversed, the Hermit has the opposite meaning:

 **The Hermit card reversed signals that you’re going a little too far with your seclusion. Even if you’re on a spiritual path, don’t overlook the need of maintaining contact with people. At one point, isolation may have been essential or beneficial to you, but The Hermit reversed is alerting you that it is time to reconnect with the community around you.**

 In moderation, taking time for spirituality and consciousness can be beneficial, but too much can be harmful. You must move ahead at some point, and this reversed Major Arcana card implies that this is the moment.

It might also imply that you’re shy or nervous in social situations. Don’t be frightened to return to the field. In reversed form, The Hermit might imply that you are fully avoiding self-reflection because you are terrified of what you will find if you delve inside yourself.

 It might be a sign that you’ve become overly obsessed with someone or something, or that your viewpoints have become too rigid and limited.

 The reversed Hermit can sometimes indicate the end of a period of introspection. You could be ready to re-enter society, this time with a better idea of what you want to do with your profession. Whether it’s seeking a new career, mingling to locate mentors and colleagues, or many other socially linked areas of your professional development, you need to realign.

If you’re in a relationship, this might indicate that you’re being ignored or mistreated. It might also mean that you and your lover are both too preoccupied to connect. Even if you are in a relationship, this might be making you feel lonely. It might also mean that one person is retreating from a partnership while the other is clinging to it.

 ## Modern Interpretations

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, and so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation for the moment.

Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

We’ll use a different deck for every one of these. Today’s is Threads of Fate Tarot.

 This card emphasizes the lantern with the Seal of Solomon. This is perfect minimal imagery because this symbol classically represents the wisdom of God.

 This is the essence of the Hermit: it is all about coming to wisdom through contemplation.

The background has been changed to a path in a forest in winter. This also makes sense. Winter is a time of isolation and reflection, but we can’t just remain static.

 We should follow our own internal path, guided by this self-wisdom to get to enlightenment. Walking alone in winter is not easy, just as this journey will not be easy. But it will be worth the effort.

## The Hermit Tarot in Context

Context matters a lot when reading the cards. Here are some particularly strong things to look out for when the Hermit appears in these contexts.

*   Past: You’ve been isolated, but it is time to come out of your shell now.
*   Present: You spend too much time with others. Inner work will benefit you.
*   Future: The help of others is beneficial now, but look for a point in the future to retreat into extended me-time.

For other types of readings:

 *   Hobbies: Look for a solitary hobby like running or reading to recharge.
*   Love: Be cautious of signs that your lover is overbearing or controlling. It may be time to leave and be on your own.
*   Work: It may be time to change careers into something less busy and chaotic.
*   Finance: You’ve been putting too much money in the hands of others. It’s time to take control of your finances and put it toward something you feel is worthy deep within yourself.
