You’ve probably seen witch bells before, but you may not be sure what they are or what they’re used for. Witch bells (or Wiccan bells) are a type of altar tool that is used in Wiccan rituals to represent the elements of air, water, fire, and earth.

 In this guide, we’ll teach you everything you need to know about witch bells. We’ll discuss their history, how to use them in your rituals, and some of the symbolism and meanings behind them.

 ## What are witch bells?

Witch bells (sometimes called witch balls) are a type of gazing ball that was popular in the 1700s and 1800s. They were used to ward off witches and evil spirits.

 Witch bells are made of glass and are typically round or oval in shape. They have a hole in the center, which allows them to be hung from a string or wire.

 Today, witch bells are often used as decorative items. They can be found in homes, gardens, and other outdoor spaces.

## The true history of witch bells

You may read on other sites that witch bells have a long and fascinating history used by witches to protect themselves from harm, to call forth the elements, and to communicate with other witches.

 This isn’t true.

Witch bells, also known as “scold’s bridles,” are a type of iron muzzle that were historically used to punish and humiliate women who were accused of being witches or of being too talkative or quarrelsome.

 The bells were often used in the 16th and 17th centuries in England, Scotland, and Germany as a way to punish and control women who were considered to be disruptive or disruptive. The bell would be placed on the woman’s head, and she would be forced to wear it in public as a form of punishment.

 The bell was intended to shame the woman and to serve as a warning to other women to behave. Some witch bells had a small metal cage over the mouth to further restrict the woman’s speech.

The use of witch bells as a means of punishment declined in the 18th and 19th centuries, and they are now considered to be a historical curiosity.

### Reclaiming witch bells

Luckily, we’ve gotten through this difficult historical period and have reclaimed the term “witch bell” to mean something positive.

 In modern Wicca and other forms of modern witchcraft, bells are often used as a tool for spiritual protection and purification.

They may be rung at the start of a ritual to clear the space of negative energies, or they may be used to signal the end of a ritual. Bells are also sometimes used to call forth the spirit of a deity or to invoke the elements.

Bells are also commonly used in Wicca and witchcraft to mark the passage of time or to mark significant events or transitions. For example, a bell might be rung at the beginning of a new year or at the start of a new moon.

 Some Wiccans and witches also use bells as a way to focus the mind and to help with meditation and visualization. The sound of a bell can be very calming and soothing and can help to clear the mind and promote a sense of inner peace.

 In summary, bells are used in Wicca and witchcraft for a variety of purposes, including spiritual protection, purification, timekeeping, and meditation.

Witch bells are made from a variety of materials, including copper, silver, brass, and iron. They come in different shapes and sizes. Each of these properties has its associated purpose.

 There are many different ways to use witch bells, and each witch bell has its own special properties. If you’re interested in learning more about witch bells, then this is the guide for you!
