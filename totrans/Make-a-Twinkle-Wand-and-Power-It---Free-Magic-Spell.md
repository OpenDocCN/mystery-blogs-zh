# Make a Twinkle Wand and Power It

Want to make a Twinkle Wand, a wand that casts any spell when you (or someone else) say the spell with it in your hand? You can even make one for each of your friends!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Make a Twinkle Wand and Power It'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Pencil

*   2 2D shapes made of paper (both the same shape)

*   Glue

*   Clear nail polish

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Pencil

*   2 2D shapes made of paper (both the same shape)

*   Glue

*   Clear nail polish

To make the Wand:
Get your pencil and your 2D paper shapes. Put glue on and near the tip of the pencil. Lay one shape on the table, put the top of the pencil on it so that it's in the middle, and put the other shape on top. Stick them down so that it looks a bit like a lollipop :)
To Power it:
To make the wand work like I said in the description/summary, paint some clear nail polish all over the wand, to make it magical and shiny. Congratulations, now you have a Twinkle Wand :D
