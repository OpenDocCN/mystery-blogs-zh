- en: Why should we draw a pentagram? How about Hexagram and Flower of life maybe?
    This is about harmony, isn't it? Could you please explain why? (in a Simple way,
    so We can remember it more easily)

- en: This is my new account, a pentagram is considered stronger for magick, well
    in my experience however if you would like to do a hexagram and flower of life
    you can :). This was also when I first started writing spells,so even a pinnacle
    would work.
