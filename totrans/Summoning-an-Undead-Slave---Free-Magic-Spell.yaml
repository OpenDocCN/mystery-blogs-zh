- en: The undead (anything from a skeleton to a 1 hour old corpse) requires no direct
    link to the master after it is created. All you need is a quick but powerful burst
    of power directed by your words, and if you are powerful enough, you can raise
    several slaves. It is recommended that you have done several power gaining rituals
    if you plan to keep the slave long-term, as it will decay if you do not rejuvenate
    it's flesh (does not concern skeleton.)

    enough, it took my teacher over 300 years to gain such power.

- en: You cannot bring someone back from the dead to be your undead slave. Furthermore,
    the persons ''teacher'' cannot be 300 years old since humans are mortal and cannot
    live that long. This entire thing is ridiculous and pure fantasy.

  prefs: []

- en: In regards to this spell, no. Deities are not dead, and you cannot revive them
    with a spell. A deity can help you on your path, but that is not how you work
    with them. You do not summon them, revive them, or cast a spell on them.
