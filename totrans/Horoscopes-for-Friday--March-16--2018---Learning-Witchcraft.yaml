    thinking about all the things that should go right. The kind of experiences you
    have in the world “out there” depend so much on what goes on inside your head,
    so be positive.

- en: By all means splash out a bit today and over the weekend. You have worked hard
    in recent weeks and are entitled to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Just be careful
    that you don’t end up paying for other people too. Watch out for freeloaders.

- en: There is no point trying to get approval for what you are planning to do – nor
    do you need to. The highly positive influence of tomorrow’s new moon means you
    can pretty much do as you please now, so get on with it and enjoy every moment.

- en: You seem to be a bit quiet at the moment but in a way that’s good because you
    have a lot to think about before the Sun moves into your birth sign early next
    week. Distance yourself from people who make far too much unnecessary noise.

    you will do so quite happily. On some deep level you understand that what you
    do for others now will be done for you later on. That’s how the universe works.

    with challenges. Tomorrow’s new moon in the career area of your chart means you
    are determined to show the world that you have what it takes to succeed.

    or shut down your ability to speak had better watch out. You have no time for
    people who think that only their ideas deserve to be heard. Come down on them
    hard.

    only will you not be able to resolve them but you could end up turning both sides
    against you. Chances are your intervention will do more harm than good.

    but that will change soon enough. Today and tomorrow though you would be wise
    to do as they say, if only because arguing is such a waste of time and energy.

    means you need to pay extra attention to your health and to make sure you are
    not pushing yourself too hard. Stay safely within your physical and emotional
    limits.

    fellow Water sign of Pisces will give your energy levels an extra boost. Romantically,
    too, this is a very good time for you, so don’t be stingy with your affections.

    less than perfect but the planets indicate that some sort of transgression will
    lower your status in the eyes of certain people. Will that worry you? Not in the
    slightest!

    to experience and don’t give a moment’s consideration to what other people might
    think about it. If it feels good, do it. And if it feels really good, do it again!
