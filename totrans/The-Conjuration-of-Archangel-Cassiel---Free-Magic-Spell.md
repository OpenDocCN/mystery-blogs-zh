**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Day of Saturn or Saturday

*   Hour of Saturn (Optional)

*   Patchouli, leather, or musk scent

*   Agate, hematite, jasper, or pyrite

If you are unsure when the Day of Saturn is, a Saturday will work just as well. Though, it is optional. The conjuration will just have a higher success rate on these days.

Start by applying the patchouli, musk, or leather scents to yourself or the room you are working in (Incense or oils, though the real herb patchouli or a piece of leather will do)

Sit in a chair or on the ground comfortably with your eyes closed. Your offering (Agate, Hematite, Jasper, Pyrite, ect) should be within your palms. How you interact with Cassiel now, is up to your personal self. If you are clairvoyant, you will see him within your mind's eye. If clairaudient, you will hear his soothing voice. Clairsentient, you will feel his comforting energies.
