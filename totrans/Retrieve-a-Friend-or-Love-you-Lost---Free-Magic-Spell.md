# Retrieve a Friend or Love you Lost

Did it end badly? If you're ready to forgive and want them back in your life, here's a little white magic.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Retrieve a Friend or Love you Lost'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   2 Dandelions with a relatively long stem

*   2 Pieces of string/thread/ribbon of the appropriate colour

*   2 Feathers (preferably that you find outside, if possible)

If you don't have dandelions, you can substitute it with another flower. I chose dandelions because they're sunny, easy to find, and the stems twist together more easily.

Do this outside on a sunny day.

Repeat the following (and admittedly rather lame) poem, adjusting or removing lines that do not apply to your situation. I personally wrote this for a friend, but I added some lines for those who are looking toward fixing things with someone more ''special.'' Adjust as needed.

Dandelion, dressed in yellow
To me you will say hello
Dandelion, yellow and bright
You and I will never fight
Dandelion, bright and sweet
Speak with sugar when we meet
Dandelion, sweet and taking root
You will forget our dispute/ You will always think I'm cute
Dandelion, rooted and growing
Friendship/Love in your heart is finally showing
There's Growth in your heart
We will have a new start
You will return to me
This is my will, so mote it be

Twist the dandelions together once with each line. If you have excess stem when you're done, pluck it off. Hold the end with your toes (that's what I did) and tie it at the top under the flowers and at the end of the stems so that it doesn't fall apart.

Dig a shallow hole about as long as the flowers, and bury them with the petals peeking out of the hole. To represent freedom, tick the two feathers in the ground next to the flowers. While you're doing this, it would be a good idea to chant something along the lines of ''free to be.''

Then you're done. If you want, you can water the flowers. I always thought it was fun.
