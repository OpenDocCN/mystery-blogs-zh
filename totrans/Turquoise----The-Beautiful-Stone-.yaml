- en: Hi and welcome to Wicca Now. As you may already know, Wicca Now is a site where
    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [Angelite.](https://wiccanow.com/angelite/) Today I thought we’d
    focus on another beautiful crystal, namely turquoise.

- en: '**Turquoise gets its name from the Old French *turque*, meaning ‘Turkish’ in
    reference to the trade route that passed through Turkey. In Greek, the name for
    turquoise translates as ‘beautiful stone’ and indeed, turquoise is one of the
    oldest known gemstones. The stone has been mined since approximately 8000 BCE
    and was valued in ancient China, Mesopotamia, Greece, Egypt and Tibet where it
    was used to create a range of both sacred and secular objects. Turquoise was also
    valued by the Navajo and Aztec people who used it to fashion many different religious
    and everyday items.**'

    from blue-green to sky blue. It has a waxy or dull lustre and a weak fluorescence
    of light blue to greenish-yellow.
