    your hands in. I keep these washes handy and use them before doing spell work.
    This wash can also be used for your floor, home, or anything else that needs cleansing.'
  prefs: []

    protect your body and your energy. Make sure that you infuse the tea with your
    specific intention to activate the properties of the protection herb.'
  prefs: []

    to your skin. Once you are aware of the safety of the herb, drop some into your

    so I use bath cleansings quite often.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I had to choose, I would say that rosemary is one of my all-time top herbs
    for protection. Rosemary is *so* strong and requires very little activation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rosemary is specifically one of the best protection herbs for *purification*
    purposes. If you need to cleanse something, burn rosemary in the air, or keep
    a small satchel of rosemary around your home. You can also brew a potion (even
    just water and rosemary works well) to cleanse your hands before performing a
    ritual.

    of protection herbs because salt is simply one of the best substances *ever* if
    you’re in need of serious protection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A bowl of salt, left out, will automatically cleanse any room. I keep salt handy
    during all my rituals. You can also sprinkle salt in the corners of your home
    or across the doorway for strong physical wards, or you can cleanse your tools
    in it.
  prefs: []

    However, I find that it works especially well for spiritual/energetic cleansing.
  prefs: []

    Throw salt on the ritual or item that is causing problems and the energy will
    be forced to dissipate.

- en: Rose isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you’re looking for protection
    herbs, but it’s surprisingly effective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea is that, because the thorns on the rose protect the flower, the flower
    will then transfer this protection to you or your spell work. Therefore, roses
    can be used for *any* type of protection because the power of the rose is mainly
    metaphorical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    time to time or even use the thorns after I get a bouquet of roses.

    popular in the witchcraft community because it has so many uses, including strong
    protective powers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    attacks. You can burn dragon’s blood incense or put some of the resin in a protection
    pouch. It will also cleanse or clear any space.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though “thorns” aren’t actually an herb, you can source them on the stems of
    various flowers. I find that thorns are super useful in protection spells because
    of the metaphorical meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    use thorns in a spell, this power will be transferred to you or your spell.
  prefs: []

    type of flower that you source your thorns from.

    herbs to use when you’re in a pinch. I always have some dried rue hanging around.
  prefs: []

    need to banish. For example, I will sometimes incorporate rue into my [freezer
    spells](https://teaandrosemarycom.bigscoots-staging.com/how-to-cast-freezer-spell/).

    at bay. Negative entities, leeches, and energetic vampires can all be banished
    using dill.
  prefs: []

    as a *physical* protection herb if you’re heading to a crowded location.

    protection when you need to *physically* protect yourself or your home.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hang mistletoe over your door to ward off unwanted intruders or wear mistletoe
    on your person as a preventative measure. Mistletoe can also be used in ritual
    baths, though it *is* a poisonous herb, so you shouldn’t ingest it.

    strong and sturdy, so oak will provide the sort of protection that lasts over
    time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oak is one of my favorite protection herbs to use for bath/cleansing spells.
    It also works quite well in a jar spell or satchel. You can even use oak if you
    enjoy arts and crafts, because it’s easy to create an incognito piece that hangs
    on your wall for decor but also protects your home.
  prefs: []

    pepper. It’s one of my favorite protection herbs when I want to energetically
    protect my home or my body.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Black pepper is especially useful for warding against the evil eye. In fact,
    it will sometimes return the evil eye to the sender. I use black pepper in spell
    jars or satchels, but it can honestly be useful in just about any type of protection
    spell.

    spirits from harming you.

    want to consider using red pepper. After all, red pepper is super popular in the
    witchcraft community for a reason!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    peppers. In many cultures, a bundle of chili peppers is hung over the door to
    ward off intruders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    physical harm. It’s one of the strongest herbs for protection that works *extremely*
    quickly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    even physical force to the sender, so don’t use it on anyone you want to stay
    close to.

    protection herbs. However, garlic can be used against basically anyone, not just
    vampires.'

    of vampires (energetic or otherwise), and protection against negative magic.
  prefs: []

    disease, so it’s one of the best herbs for protection against illness.

    should be your #1 choice. Just sprinkling the herb around any area will instantly
    create a ward.'
  prefs: []

    or evil spirits. It’s easy enough to sprinkle some agrimony under my doormat.
    Agrimony provides an extra layer of warding that makes me feel more comfortable,
    plus it *really* works!

    plant the tree itself outside your front door or utilize birch as one of your
    go-to protection herbs, birch is extremely effective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I use birch for general protection. It’s both spiritual and physical. Birch
    is said to protect against lightening, storms, and the evil eye; I’ve found this
    to be true, but it also works in just about any protection spell or even in a
    bath.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    during spell work. However, make sure that you have good intentions when using
    angelica. Angels live by a strict moral code and won’t help you if you intend
    to curse or hurt anyone.

    on this list. It has been used in folk magic for centuries.

    used by the ancient Romans to protect a baby from evil spirits and negativity.
    However, it is sacred to the Fae, so be careful if you happen upon a patch of
    Hawthorne in nature – don’t disturb the plant unless you have permission.

    a means of protection. Even if you aren’t able to actually grow elder bushes around
    your house (though it’s a cool idea!), elder can still work as one of the protection
    herbs that you employ in your spells.
  prefs: []

    pine trees, but I never realized that the trees themselves are what gave me such
    a sense of security.

    that most floor wash recipes include pine!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you can brew a pine needle tea for good health. If you’d rather burn the needles,
    you can use the smoke to drive away evil spirits.

    protection herb, you’re essentially calling upon sun gods.

    herbs for protection. When you use eucalyptus, you’ll purify your space *and*
    heal your energy or body all at once.
  prefs: []

    example, a daily cleansing with eucalyptus will softly rid your aura of negative
    energy, but you won’t feel drained after. It’s also great for bath spells.
