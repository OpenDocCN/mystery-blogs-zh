    with someone''s life for fun. Yes, I completely get wanting to make someone you
    dislike to suffer [been there, done that, bought the t-shirt] but unless they''re
    actively attacking you, take the high road and live your best life [Nothing upsets
    your enemies more than seeing you succeed] If you choose to cast this spell, it
    seems plausible, but I would change a few things, such as adding the blood last
    [personally I wouldn''t pick a different spell because I don''t work with blood]
    be sure to charge your hatred for this person, otherwise, this won''t work, or
    it won''t be as strong. [you need to charge negative emotions for curses]'
