    other special ritual items. Consecration is a spell in itself, so take your time
    as you bless and cleanse each tool of any unwanted energies.

- en: In this video, we use sage smoke to cleanse the ritual objects. If you prefer
    to use a different type of scent, feel free to do it. **[Palo santo](https://spells8.com/lessons/palo-santo-magic/)**
    and **[Cinnamon](https://spells8.com/lessons/cinnamon-herbal-magic/) incense**
    are other great options for purifying and sanctifying your tools. Learn more about
    their properties in the [Green Witchcraft Video Course](https://spells8.com/courses/green-witchcraft-course/).

    you visualize your energy aligning with the element. Imagine your energy as a
    gentle, glowing light, which radiates from you to surround it until that object
    also pulses softly with your energy.
