    water is just fine.

- en: Make sure your stone is physically and energetically clean. You don't want to
    consume any dirt on the stone. Place your stone inside the container, and set
    it in the sunlight. If it is a moonlight stone, place it in the moonlight. Such
    as Moonstone/Celestite(Celestine). Let the stone soak in the water, visualize
    the energies of the stone being absorbed by the water, and place it in the sunlight.
    This is a double effect, where the stone is being charged, but also releasing
    its energies into the water.

- en: I would leave it sitting in the sunlight for a few hours. That way you are sure
    it's effective. The longer it sits out, the more potent the water is.

- en: After it has been sitting in the sunlight, drink it. Let the effects take place.
