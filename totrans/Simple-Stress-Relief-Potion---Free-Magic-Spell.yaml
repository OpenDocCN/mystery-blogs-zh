    A warm glass of milk sweetened with a little lavender sugar would be also helpful.
    Chamomile tea is very soothing. Sugar combined with sugar will probably result
    in more stress since you will be energetic.

    problems sleeping. This calms you down. I don't really prefer drinks because it
    doesn't calm me down as well. Maybe a nice relaxing bath with some Epsom bath
    salts will work since it does for me. Idk.
