    aspects create a deep feeling of emotional intimacy. Couples with these aspects
    may experience a psychic or emotional bond, and it’s easy for one or both people
    to see their partner as the “ideal” mate, especially when they first meet.

    ways.

    manipulate the other if their partner isn’t being attentive or responsive. The
