# Turn Your Pet into a Fairy

This will turn any pet into a fairy (except fish, of course)!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Turn Your Pet into a Fairy'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Take one treat out and set it down on some surface. Kiss two fingers on your hand like a "peace" sign, and put your fingers on the treat. Then, pet your pet three times. After that, say, "Listen here, listen here, fairies are for real. Good boy/girl, good boy/girl, now eat this fairy treat", and give them the treat.

After it has been fully eaten, it will take 7-9 days for the fairy transformation to complete and the wings to fully grow. Simple, right? To teach your pet to fly, I recommend holding a toy or treat above them so they jump to get it. (S)he will probably be a bit nervous to fly at first, but once they get used to fluttering about, they most likely won't be able to stop!

You can not turn other creatures into a fairy.

Some people believe you can. Although you and others say that isn't correct, people still believe. Also, did you atleast try it? Don't attack me or anything I'm just saying + I'm new-

Some people believe vaccines cause autism, but it does not make it true. Fairy's are real. I have worked with them for many years, however, they are spirits; Astral beings. You can work with them, befriend them, but you cannot transform yourself or other physical beings into them. Furthermore, I am not attacking you. You stated your opinion, I am explaining my comment. Whether or not you choose to accept the reality of Magic is entirely up to you. Nobody, myself included, is about to demand you conform. We post these, as people claim, ''negative'' comments, not to bully or hurt people, but to educate and inform. Real Magic is not the same as Hollywood fantasy magic. Research and discover this for yourself.

is there a version of this that works on fish?

No, this spell doesn't work, it's fake.

You cannot turn a pet into a faerie.

Two things One this spell is fake and even if it worked its just cruel A dog is a dog they should stay a dog not a fairy or mermaid or vampire etc, if it worked anyways same goes for all animals they were born that way and should stay that way sure if they went up to you and said ''I want to be a fairy make me one'' then sure try and make timmy the turtle a fairy but i doubt that happened so please dont do that.
