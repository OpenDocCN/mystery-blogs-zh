# Remove Bad Luck or Ill Wishes

  Rated 5/5 Stars

I have used this spell many times and it is very effective. It is used when you feel another person is wishing bad luck upon you.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Remove Bad Luck or Ill Wishes'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Stand holding the mirror in both hands at arms length and so you can see your own reflection in the glass. As you turn in a clockwise direction repeat three times the following

"Circle of reflection,
Circle of protection,
May the sender of all harm,
Feel the power of this charm."

Then take your mirror and place it in the window in the direction of the person sending you bad wishes, or straight if you are unsure of the direction the ill will is coming from. This is a very powerful charm and need only be repeated when you feel it necessary.

I do not have a hand mirror but I do have a mirror that I can hold. Will that work?
