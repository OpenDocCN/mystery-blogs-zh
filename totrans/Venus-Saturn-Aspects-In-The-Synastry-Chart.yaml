- en: Though Venus and Saturn are two fundamentally different planets, aspects between
    them in the synastry chart can make for a strong and longterm relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I often find that these planets represent people who truly desire a deep bond,
    but there is sometimes a struggle in the way that this is obtained. Saturn is
    often strict and cold, while Venus is spontaneous and fun-loving.

    their worst, they try to change the other person and eventually break apart.

- en: With the Venus conjunct Saturn synastry aspect, both people feel a strong and
    immediate attraction. However, the relationship can start to feel monotonous or
    boring much more quickly than other partnerships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, the Venus conjunct Saturn synastry aspect indicates that even the honeymoon
    phase might feel sort of lackluster. The relationship is probably quite steady,
    but it’s not exciting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the couple that quickly falls into a routine though they barely know
    each other. Often, the Saturn person is the driver of routine and predictability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the Venus conjunct Saturn synastry aspect, this predictability can happen
    in just about any area of life. It may show up in daily routines, as boring conversations
    that are always the same, or this may be the couple who hangs out with the exact
    same friends every weekend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This relationship can be very stable and safe, but it can also feel boring or
    predictable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn person will help to keep the Venus person’s emotions and ideas stable,
    but they can quickly go overboard if they aren’t careful. Too much of this control
    causes the Venus person to feel stifled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it enhances trust between the couple. They know what to expect from each other
    – there are no surprises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be a big reason why the couple stays together, even when the fun is
    gone. Loyalty and commitment are huge in this relationship. Many people stay simply
    because it’s safe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn person can sometimes come across as cold or authoritarian. At their
    worst, they attempt to restrict the freedom of the Venus person and become more
    like a parent figure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus person may appreciate some of the Saturn person’s rigidity, usually
    in an “opposites attract” sort of way, but they can also feel restricted, especially
    socially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, the Venus person can get depressed from being around the Saturn individual.
    They might just want more *fun* in their life and could feel that they have lost
    their spark.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the Venus person will also recognize that the Saturn person will provide
    true security, yet they probably feel like part of their personality gets rejected
    when Saturn sets cold rules. They end up compromising their inner light in order
    to feel secure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus conjunct Saturn synastry relationship can really change the Venus
    person over time, especially if the Saturn person is overbearing. It’s important
    that the Venus person learns to work with the Saturn person *without* losing the
    part of themself that is spontaneous and fun loving.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that the *sign* that Venus is in will influence this dynamic. If
    Venus sits in a more serious sign (like Capricorn or Virgo), then the restrictions
    from Saturn will feel more comfortable for Venus. If Venus sits in a flighty or
    independent sign (like Sagittarius or Leo), then Venus will struggle against these
    restrictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn must learn to compromise so that the relationship doesn’t start to feel
    like a prison for Venus. In fact, Saturn can actually learn how to loosen up and
    be spontaneous *from* the Venus individual, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the relationship gets to the point where the Venus person is afraid to say
    what’s on their mind, then big changes must be made in order for the relationship
    to survive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn person must also be able to express when they feel that the Venus
    person is acting overly emotional or childish (without being hurtful or cold)
    so that they can still meet their own needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus person must learn how to speak logically with the Saturn person instead
    of acting irrational or changeable. In extreme cases, the Venus person can be
    emotional erratic or immature. If these issues are present, then the Venus person
    will also have work to do and must learn how to be emotionally honest without
    going from 0 to 100.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, the Venus conjunct Saturn synastry relationship involves a lot of
    compromise. The Venus person will feel as though they lose a bit of personal freedom
    while the the Saturn person may feel like their world is out of whack due to the
    Venus person’s changeability. However, both people can learn a lot from this relationship
    if they’re willing to put the emotional work in.
  prefs: []

    opposite qualities in each other, yet they also feel unhinged when the other person
    acts so differently from them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a relationship that feels secure *and* fun.
  prefs: []

    but Saturn must also be willing to go out of their comfort zone, which can make
    them feel very insecure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this relationship can be the very opportunity they need to work through their
    inner issues. Venus quite literally uncovers Saturn’s insecurities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus conjunct Saturn synastry aspect can make each person grow by leaps
    and bounds as they are forced to let go of control. They can each learn how to
    be vulnerable with each other if they’re willing to truly learn about how the
    other person is and *why* they need certain things in the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    how to open up and truly show love and affection for each other so that they can
    feel accepted in this Venus conjunct Saturn synastry relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from themselves. These differences can be celebrated and this couple can create
    a relationship that is diverse and growth-oriented.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    intimacy. If Saturn is able to open up and explain *why* they feel a certain way,
    the Venus person’s perspective will change completely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect suggests that both people have a karmic fear of rejection which
    must be healed. They each feel that their fundamental natures will be rejected
    by the other, however they must *first* learn how to accept themselves and then
    accept these differences in each other.
  prefs: []

    while other times they simply have similar issues and come together in order to
    heal.

    sort of relationship, but it usually works. The flow of energy is simply natural.
  prefs: []

    will naturally learn lessons through this relationship. Saturn will teach Venus
    how to become more grounded while Venus will teach Saturn to loosen up and speak
    what’s on their mind, to express their emotions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but many of these lessons have already been learned in a past life. Now, the couple
    gets to integrate these lessons learned into their life and reap the benefits.

    need to work to pull these qualities out of each other in a *positive* way. Saturn
    can learn how to provide stability without being overwhelming and Venus can learn
    how to be fun without being too emotionally reactive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the Venus person trust in the Saturn person’s loyalty and dedication. Saturn may
    be more traditional in the relationship, which Venus probably enjoys.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    struggle to change. They can be very authoritative and can try to force the Venus
    person to become who they want them to be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn person can see the natural light that is in Venus, yet they can’t
    seem to loosen up. This can cause friction because both people have opposite ways
    of doing things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Venus feels happy and light about something, the Saturn person can put
    the Venus person down or show disdain. It’s important that the Saturn person loosens
    up and tries to see things from Venus’s point of view.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn may feel that their rules are always right and employ black or white
    thinking. This can be really difficult, but if Saturn doesn’t learn to temper
    their authoritarian ways, they can loose Venus’s light.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, the Saturn person is strict because they have deep fears. The Venus
    person can sometimes help them to work through these fears, but Saturn must be
    ready to do the work. If Saturn refuses, the relationship will certainly struggle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meanwhile, the Venus person needs to understand the limits of Saturn. This will
    go more smoothly if Venus is in a practical sign, such as Capricorn or Virgo,
    and will be more difficult if Venus is mutable.
  prefs: []

    cold or harsh. This can be a bit threatening.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn must learn how to convey their criticisms in a less judgmental way. In
    fact, Saturn may judge Venus for all of the things that Venus likes about themselves,
    so the Venus square Saturn synastry relationship can really damage Venus’s self
    esteem.
  prefs: []

    learn a good dose of empathy in this partnership.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes in the Venus opposition Saturn synastry relationship, both people
    can feel like the world wants to keep them apart in some way. Maybe others don’t
    condone the relationship, or maybe external circumstances make it hard to stay
    together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sort of wound or hurt. Often, there were harsh judgments between this couple that
    has carried over into the current lifetime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn person has an inability to give the Venus person what they need.
    Often, Venus ends up being unsatisfied and resentful of Saturn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    even see how Venus is different, but Venus can still feel suffocated or even depressed
    around the Saturn person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that Venus is childish, undisciplined, and immature in some way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    falling into this negative cycle. When they start to feel critical of each other,
    this is a sign to step back and worth through these judgements before they affect
    the relationship.
  prefs: []

    how to have fun so that neither feels suffocated.
  prefs: []

    over the long term, even though it can feel painful. Saturn, at their best, can
    be a steadying influence towards Venus that really helps Venus to evolve and mature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    enhance the lives of the other, but it’s essential that they do this through *non-judgment.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest issue in the Venus square Saturn synastry relationship is that both
    Saturn and Venus tend to judge without trying to understand. If they instead ask
    each other questions from a place of wanting to learn rather than judge, then
    they will come to embrace the differences between them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have the Venus square Saturn synastry aspect, remember that both people
    can have different viewpoints on the same conversation or event and both viewpoints
    will be valid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learn to say, “I *felt* that this was…” rather than “this *was*…” and ask the
    same of your partner. Arguing about the *facts* of something won’t help you here
    because you see the world in fundamentally different ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, you must learn to temper each other and become more flexible without
    trying to control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or flighty, while Venus feels that Saturn truly *is* cold. Underneath, none of
    this is true, but you must dig deep to reach those layers instead of reacting
    with judgments.
