    They were considered evil and spreading mischief with their magic. They were also
    sought out and punished for crimes they did not commit. We’ve come a long way

    or the people in the surrounding region. They frequently adopt a historical approach,
    employing magical methods and ideas that predate Wicca, and they may have access
    to a plethora of material on centuries-old spells, charms, talismans, and herbal
    brews.

    practitioners, but they may also be part of a coven. Kitchen witches use natural

    sea creatures and the elements. They can use this power to do good and bad things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    large bodies of water or in coastal towns. They can also be found in rivers or
    lakes if they live near them, but it is not as common for them to live inland.
  prefs: []

    or whales, but others have more of an affinity for all sea life and can communicate
    with anything that lives in the water.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are a hedge witch, you will have a natural inclination to be drawn to
    the natural world and all of its mysteries. You are an intuitive person who is
    on the lookout for the unknown and the unseen. You have an affinity for all things
    that grow in nature, such as herbs and plants.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    They typically do not use tools or spells, but instead work with their intuition
    to help others with their problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    But it is their capacity to traverse the “hedge,” or the divide between this world
    and the astral realm, that distinguishes them as a hedge witch.

    that they use are often indicative of their type. The most common colors are black,
    white, red, and green. Witches who practice in green magic are called “green witches”
    or “nature witches” because they work closely with the earth and nature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Green witches believe that there is a balance between man and the Earth; they
    believe in living in harmony with nature rather than conquering it. This is why
    many people associate them with the color green – because it symbolizes growth
    and fertility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and perform with native plants. Plants/greenery are used by green witches in their
    spells and magic, as well as in their food and homes.

    from the cosmos and astrology into their practice. These witches, sometimes known

    their charms and rituals on the various placements.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but they don’t associate their work with spirituality. Secular witches don’t worship
    any gods or higher beings, and their practice is completely secular.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    This isn’t to suggest that a non-spiritual witch can’t be spiritual; it’s just
    that their job isn’t. The two are completely distinct.

    witch and become a different type later on or vice-versa.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Solitary witches can be any sort of witch, although they prefer to work alone
    rather than in a coven. This might be through choice or because they have yet
    to form a working group. They don’t require a coven as much as a newer witch since
    they recall and understand the craft.

    fit well into any one category, generally because they include magical ideas and
    practices from several places.

    eclectic witches that use elements from other magical traditions that appeal with
    them.

    knowledge gained from a class, and their own personal experience to create a singular,
    practical manner of executing rituals and spells.

    its original form, or to distinguish an uninitiated individual performing their
    own version of otherwise oathbound material.
