    occult . Even advanced practitioners sometimes think it''s a "party trick" because
    they might have little to no practical experience with using it and have come
    to accept this idea without properly investigating it further.*'

    it measures energy patterns, which is extremely valuable for energy work.

- en: In fact, the pendulum is one of the few tools that has nearly infinite applications
    available to it, as its chief function is energy, and, therefore, there's almost
    no end to the experiments that can be done with it or ways that it can be used.

    idea that subtle energy can effectively influence things in such a way, like the
    pendulum, is incredible and almost doesn't seem believable.

    really does make it more aligned with science than people might realize. In fact,
    it would only seem that because science currently accepts a more material model
    and is still learning to understand such things, that this is the only barrier
    separating it from being used and fully accepted as a scientific tool with nearly
    endless applications.

    like finding answers to future questions, but don''t always realize how multi-faceted
    it is, and that there''s so much more that you can do with the pendulum.*'

- en: For example, you can use the pendulum to **measure the subtle energy of a person's
    body**. Not just the energy of the chakras, but literally every part of your body
    — anything. It goes without saying that this is incredibly useful because when
    one learns the pendulum's patterns, they're able to see what kind of state the
    different parts of their body are in, energetically, and where there's tension
    that needs to be released or brought back into harmony and balance with the rest
    of the body's energy.

    beneficial** or enhancing to your energy when wearing it.

- en: Clothing can actually influence your energy quite a bit. Many people don't even
    think about it, but clothing, like anything else, has different energy patterns,
    and so, your clothing energetically influences you the whole time you're wearing
    it, so it can be good to find clothing that has an energy pattern that will be
    beneficial to your energy and not impede it in any way.

- en: You can even do an experiment where you keep track of how you feel when wearing
    the same clothing, but on different days, and compare how you felt on those different
    days with one article of clothing compared to other articles of clothing on different
    days, and if the feelings are consistent, you can energetically use wearing certain
    articles of clothing to your advantage to help enhance your energy.

- en: One day, modern society will get there in its understanding of the pendulum
    — that it's a tool that's **showing you the energy patterns that exist in the
    energy all around us** — but, for now, it's something that also still makes the
    pendulum one of the most occult tools available as well, because so few people,
    sometimes magicians included, don't even understand its full potential. And there's
    no problem with this, but you can be one of the few who does get to take advantage
    of it and make your life better.
