- en: I performed this spell three or four nights ago. However I didn't do it for
    seven consecutive nights. Because I felt within myself I believed the spell manifested
    alot quicker with quicker results. I did address the candle with liquorice oil
    which aids in commanding the perpetrator to reveal the lies they have been hiding.
    Blessed Be everybody.

    choice, but it would work. I would also carve a sigil/symbol into the candle that
    represents truth, justice, or honesty. Otherwise, this appears to be a working
    spell.
