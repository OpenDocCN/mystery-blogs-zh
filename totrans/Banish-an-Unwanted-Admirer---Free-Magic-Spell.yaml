- en: Cast this spell three days or nights in a row when the Moon is waning. If you
    can't get your hands on fresh vervain leaves, use the dried ones that should be
    available at a local herbalist. You'll need about a handful of either. The spell
    is best cast outside. If this is not possible, it can be done indoors, but as
    it involves a fire, it must be done with great care.

    throw the vervain on to the flames, calling out the name of the person you want
    out of your life as loudly and with as much passion as you can muster. Follow
    the name with these words, which should also be said with passion:'
