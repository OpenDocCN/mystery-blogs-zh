    of the moon to cast all types of spells, including moon spells, is extremely effective!

    magic, but I *do* consider myself a lunar witch or moon witch too, because I work
    so closely with the energy of the moon. I find that the moon is incredibly powerful *and*
    comforting at the same time, making it the perfect energetic force for both beginner
    and advanced witches!

    This post will be about more than just manifestation. Specifically, I’ll go into
    the various spells, rituals, *and* manifestation techniques that I use during
    each moon phase, as well as *how* to work with the moon and feel closer to its
    energy in your practice.

    is the moon’s *phases*. Each moon phase has a specific meaning in witchcraft,
    but I find that these meanings also extend to every day life, not only spell work.

    set your intentions. However, this is relevant to the real world, too. The stock
    market often begins a new cycle during the full moon, just like you’ll find that
    you automatically start new endeavors or set things in motion at the same time,
    even if you didn’t previously realize it was a new moon.

    does effect the energy, regardless of the phase.

    in the present tense (as though the thing has already happened), then I burn each
    slip of paper and bury the ashes in a houseplant or outside.

    create a sigil for your intention. After, you can set out this sigil somewhere
    you can see it daily, put it under your pillow, draw it on your skin, or carry
    it with you.

    that the moon water will take on the characteristics of the moon *sign* too (more

    be used in recurring spells relating to your intentions.

    I go to sleep at night. Keep in mind that the moon’s actual energy is different

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most simple ways to be a moon witch is to quite literally draw power
    from the moon.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you cast a spell, you need to raise energy and draw on a source. There
    just isn’t enough energy in your body to effect change, plus you’re likely to
    make yourself sick if you deplete your energy by putting it into your materials.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, it’s important that you learn how to connect with a *source* that you
    can draw energy from. Many witches draw from the earth, fire (a candle flame),
    the wind, from a crystal, a plant, or from spirit guides. However, you can also
    draw energy from the moon.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For me, moon magic simply means that you’re drawing from the moon or working
    with the moon in some way. The moon has an *enormous* amount of energy, so it’s
    a great source of power once you learn how to connect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to connect with the moon, try doing a meditation. See if you can sense
    the energy of the moon and feel the phase that the moon is in. The energy will
    slightly different during each phase and astrological sign, so it’s helpful to
    look at these specifics before doing your meditation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ask the moon to connect with you. Picture energy flowing from the moon into
    your body. Make sure that you have somewhere to *put* that energy (you can even
    send it back to the moon through your fingertips) or you may get overcharged.
    After, I like to thank the moon for working with me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also do many of the moon witch practices that I’ll list below (such
    as making moon water, charging your tools in the moonlight, etc.) to connect with
    the moon. Think of this like a working relationship; no one becomes a lunar witch
    in one day. It takes time for you to learn the energy of the moon and to build
    a true connection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I *do* recommend that you work with the moon during the nighttime, at least
    at first. Over time, when you’re more sensitive to the lunar energy, you will
    be able to connect with the moon even when it isn’t visible to the human eye.
    However, I think that it’s easiest to connect with the moon’s energy at night
    when you’re just starting out on your path to be a moon witch.

    the energy of the moon.

    moon spell.
  prefs: []

    you can make moon water any night of the year. However, you should definitely
    scroll up to the beginning of this post and read more about the moon’s *phases*
    if you’re unfamiliar with these terms.

    light. Simply leave your tools out overnight and allow them to absorb the energy.

    a moon sign calendar before you do this.
  prefs: []

    light. I find that the energy of the moon is *extremely* potent but is also quite
    gentle. Moon magic both charges and cleanses my tools at once. I find that my
    tools work much more effectively in moon spells if they’ve already had contact
    with lunar energy previous to casting, too.

    during a specific moon phase. For example, you could create a sigil out of your
    new moon ritual intention, or a sigil of release during your full moon ritual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After I create my sigil, I leave it out to charge under the moon. I then either
    place my sigil in a spot where I can see it every day (or at least during the
    moon cycle), or I carry it on my person.

    with moon deities. A beginner moon witch should spend more time working with the
    energy of the moon itself (at least until you know how to actually connect with

    it would feel to try and contact a lunar deity.
