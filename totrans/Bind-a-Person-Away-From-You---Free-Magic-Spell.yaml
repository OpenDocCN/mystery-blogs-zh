- en: First, draw a purple pentacle on the piece of paper. Then, write the person's
    full name in black in the center of the pentacle. If you like, you can draw any
    religious symbols on the paper as you wish. Then, take the bottom right corner
    of the paper and fold it up to the upper left corner. You should get a triangle.
    Fold this in half to get a smaller triangle. Fold this small triangle in half
    one more time.

    name), with purple, black, and white, please o please, just leave my life. Leave
    me now, make my life better, make your life better, forever and ever." Take the
    paper and hold it to your third eye, saying, "To be protected from you, this magick
    charm I shall do. I bind thee away from me, please o please just protect me. To
    be protected from your harm, I herby now cast out this charm." Say this three
    to nine times.

    You can now bury it, burn it, or keep it with you or on your altar. I recomend
    doing all three for maximum effects. While burning or burying it, visualize them
    leaving your life forever, while chanting, "(Person's name), please leave my life,
    enhance both our lives more than ever before. So mote it be." Then they should
    be gone within a week or so. Both of your lives should benefit to them leaving,
    and nobody gets hurt!

    the best options, or leave it on the altar for a time, then burn it and bury the
    ashes.

- en: '@nekoshema I did all 3 like you suggested. Did the burning and burying about
    2 weeks ago. So far I haven''t heard from him not once. I realised I made one
    error though. The instructions said to write the name in black, I did it in purple
    like everything else. That won''t be a problem right?'

- en: Nope. Purple can be substituted for black, same with a dark blue. You'll be
    fine.
