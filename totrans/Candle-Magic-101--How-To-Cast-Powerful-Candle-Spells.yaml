  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay, let’s start with the basics. Candle magic is a form of spellwork or ritual
    that harnesses the power of candles to focus your intention and manifest your
    goals. It’s like using candles as a tool to amplify your thoughts and desires
    out into the universe. Pretty cool, right? The idea is that as you light your
    candle and focus on your intention, the flame acts as a beacon, sending your energy
    and wishes out into the cosmos.

- en: Candle magic has roots that stretch back through the annals of time, with traces
    of its practice found in ancient civilizations around the world. In ancient Egypt,
    candles were used in rituals honoring the gods and goddesses, with the flickering
    flame symbolizing the presence of divine energy. Similarly, in ancient Rome, candles
    were often lit as offerings to the gods, believed to carry prayers and petitions
    to the heavens.

- en: The practice of using candles for magical purposes also has deep roots in medieval
    Europe, where it became intertwined with various occult traditions and mystical
    practices. During the Middle Ages, candles were often inscribed with symbols,
    words, or sigils to enhance their magical potency, and they were used in rituals
    for everything from healing to protection to divination.

- en: '**Primarily, you’ll choose candle magic when you need a spell to happen *fast*.**
    Think about fire – it lights quickly and blows out just as swiftly. Candle magic
    is similar. **[Jar spells](https://teaandrosemary.com/jar-spells-rituals/)** take
    a while to manifest, but tend to hold, while candle spells manifest quickly but
    may not last as long.'

    so, and when you’re not looking for super long-term results. If you need something
    to happen quickly but *also* last, you can combine a candle spell with a jar spell.

- en: Now that you’ve got your candle, it’s time to set your intention. This is the
    heart and soul of candle magic – the thing you want to manifest or bring into
    your life. Take a moment to think about what you truly desire, whether it’s love,
    abundance, healing, or anything else your heart desires. Be as specific as possible,
    without limiting the spell. For example, you can be super specific about what
    you want, but may not want to mention *how *or *when* you get it, to allow the
    magic to work in unexpected ways.

    and focus on infusing it with your energy and intention. Visualize your goal as
    if it’s already happening, and really feel the emotions associated with it. When
    you’re ready, place the candle in a holder and get ready to light it up!

    or flick your lighter, take a deep breath and feel the energy shift in the room.
    As the flame ignites, imagine it as a spark of divine energy, carrying your intention
    out into the universe. Some people like to say a little prayer or affirmation
    as they light their candle, while others prefer to simply focus on their intention
    in silence. Do whatever feels right for you!

    You might want to meditate, pray, or simply sit quietly and visualize your goal
    coming to fruition. Let the flame be your guide, drawing you deeper into a state
    of relaxation and receptivity. Pay attention to any thoughts, feelings, or insights
    that arise during this time – they could be messages from your higher self or
    the universe guiding you towards your desired outcome.

    burn it in the flame if you desire. But this isn’t at all necessary for a candle

    out the ritual. You can do this by extinguishing the flame with a snuffer or by
    blowing it out gently (just be careful not to blow wax everywhere!). Or, you can
    let the candle burn down until it extinguishes naturally. Trust that your intention
    has been heard and that the wheels are now in motion to bring your desires into
    reality.
