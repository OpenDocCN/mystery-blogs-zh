    fact, revenge spells should not be taken lightly and are sometimes of fierce nature.

    perform this spell in your room. Make sure that this spell is performed only on
    a full moon night. Cast an imaginary circle around you. Place the image (photo
    or doll) of the target at the center of the imaginary circle. Then place four
    black candles around the circle, each one facing one direction (North, South,
    East & West). You will sit facing the south. At this direction place two red candles,
    one on either side of the black candle. At the northern end place the remaining
    red candle. Now take the hair/thread of your target and affix it on the doll or
    the photo. Once this is done, pick up the red candle behind you and bow down once
    in each direction and seek the pardon of your deities for the action you are going
    to perform. Then using the same candle burn the doll or the photo starting with
    the hair/thread first. Once it is completely burnt, exhaust all the candles and
    leave the room for the next twenty nine (29) minutes. The spell will work overnight.
