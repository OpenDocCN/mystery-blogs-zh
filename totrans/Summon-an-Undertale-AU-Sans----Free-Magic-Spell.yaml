    a video game character by the way. That just does not make sense, video game character....think...how
    does that possibly work? That just is not logic. Sorry if I sound rude, I am just
    not in a good mood today, I try my best not to be mean. Again, sorry.

    into existence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: "Hmm??? What color should I use for nightmare? I can\x92t figure a color out."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would think of a dark blue maybe.... you know because he's always dripping
    ink but his eye color is blue so I kinda just mix the two
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    \ try blue or dark blue. Thanks!"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would I use for dust!tale sans? Like what color candle and what to represent
    him? Thanks
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind this wont summon anything in the physical realm, since Sans is
    fictional. This might be okay for astral projection, but I don't know.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oh... okay... But still what would I use?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use the same ritual, but maybe before prepping yourself for projection, so that
    you summon it in the astral realm. Could also try a guided meditation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look up Dust's design and pick 1-3 main colors, and something from his aesthetic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay thanks! I am thinking purple candles! But what would I use to resemble
    him?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are you able to use cooked chicken bones??
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use whatever you like, doesn't mean it will work. You cannot summon
    a fantasy, fictional character from a video game series, that isn't how magick
    works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fast question how can you summon the female versions of sans just asking
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No, and you can't summon any other version either. He's a fictional character.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would represent fresh other than his glasses, and the candle maybe?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a fake spell so it doesn't matter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a fannypack, skate borad, think 80's
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what colour candle(s) for Error!Sans? ;-;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This doesn't work because these are fictional characters and therefore can't
    be summoned [at best, you can pool your energy into their shape and make a thoughtform
    or servator, but it wouldn't be the character from the game] If you still wish
    to try, white is a generic stand-in for all things. If the character has a particular
    colour associated with them, use that.
  prefs: []

- en: did this work for anyone? please let me know btw what candle do i need for lust
    or lustswap
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how big are they i want to make sure they can fit in my house and only you can
    see them or anyone can?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: "I\x92m sorry not to be rude but if you mean this literally you are extremely\
    \ wrong if I\x92m not wrong sans is a character from the game undertale he is\
    \ not real so therefor he can\x92t be your friend of significant other magick\
    \ is a force of nature so if your summoning things like gods spirits and things\
    \ like that you are usually invoking them from the astral plane but sans is a\
    \ video game so he does not exist in this world the afterlife or the astral plane\
    \ so summoning it is virtually impossible"
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what if we cant get candles i only have white candles from my mom but i
    cant use them
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This spell cannot work. It is not possible to ''summon'' an imaginary, fictional
    character.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This particular spell will not work, as Sans is fictional, but white candles
    are basically a substitute for any candle color.(Also I feel your pain- I wish
    I could summon Sans too- :,))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is fake and does not work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as cool as this sounds this spell does not work, sans is a fictional character
    aswell as the au verions of him
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know that I am late for this stuff, but does this really work?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This specific spell, no. Undertale is a work of fiction and therefore these
    characters don't exist. However, you could create a thoughtform [if you know how
    to make psi balls, you would then form the energy into the character and make,
    essentially, an imaginary friend you would give energy to in exchange for the
    beings protection/companionship/whatever you want it for] It might even be possible
    to work with an egregore if the character [when enough people believe in something,
    they unknowingly feed energy into a thoughtform and in a way, make it a spirit]
    however, this specific spell isn't how you make thoughtforms, so I wouldn't waste
    time on that. Research thoughtforms, servitors, and egregores and see if you wish
    to work with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's a psi?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: psi is short for ''psychic.'' If you're seeing the term ''psi ball'' it's a
    ball of magickal energy you use in spells and other magickal workings. It's not
    visible [unless you have psychic abilities, then you may see something like a
    colour or outline of a shape] you'll feel the energy pulsing in your hand, some
    warms, possibly tingles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay that sort of makes sense
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's working
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You cannot ''summon'' a fictional character. This spell is fake.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what do i do if none of my candels match?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As many have stated in he above comments, this spell won't work. You can't summon
    a fictional character. The most you can do is create a thoughtform that resembles
    the character.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tried with ink, all the hope i had, wanted to have a friend for my birthday,
    i don't think it worked, the sketch book i used still has my bad drawings in it
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It didn't work because this spell is nonsense. Real magic doesn't work like
    this. Perhaps you can research thoughtforms and servitors if you wish to have
    a companion like you stated above, but this spell isn't how you go about doing
    that.
