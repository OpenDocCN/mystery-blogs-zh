- en: A protection spell is something you do with focus and intent in order to affect
    change. To put it simply, spells are a set of symbolic actions taken to activate
    change. When spellcasting, you function as the agent of change, directing and
    forming energy towards the desired outcome. Will spellcasting work instantly?
    Most probably not. Beware that magick generally takes time to manifest and you
    might not even notice the effects as they gently creep in bit by bit.
