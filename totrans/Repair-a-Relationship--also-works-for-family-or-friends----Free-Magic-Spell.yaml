  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A simple spell that'll help you repair your friendship or other relationship
    with another person. It can be used in-regards to both long and short-term conflict.

- en: '**You will need the following items for this spell:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One yellow or pink candle (white is a manageable substitute for any other colour)
    - I recommend a tealight, because you should let the wick burn naturally and it'd
    take a long time otherwise.

- en: One small piece of paper - you should cut it before starting if needed, if you
    cut after writing on the paper it can be construed as severing a relationship,
    especially if you use scissors.

- en: Write your own full name on the piece of paper, followed by that of the individual
    you wish to repair your friendship with. This can also work for a relative or
    relationship, and you could theoretically write several names of people you wish
    to reconcile with - although I wouldn't recommend it, it could weaken the effects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Draw a circle around the names - it doesn't need to be perfect, but if does
    need to completely surround the names, and be unbroken.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Place the paper on a surface and position your candle on top of it, in the center
    of the circle. Light it and watch the flame for a moment. See the way it flickers,
    smell the burning, watch the circular shadow around the base. Move your hands
    closer and feel the heat. The energy, the power. This is the same energy that
    you're channeling into the task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more you become aware of that energy, and the more you interact with it,
    the higher the power and scope of the spell will be. I've even known people to
    touch the hot wax afterwards, although I obviously can't officially recommend
    that as it could cause you physical harm. Regardless, this is a relatively basic
    spell and it shouldn't be overly necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When you''ve finished initial interactions with the flame, keep watching it,
    think about the individual you wish to fix things with, and repeat the following
    phrase 3 times:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Peace and resolution, I ask from your heart. I make amends in the power I send.
    Let yesterday stay in yesterday, and tomorrow bring back trust.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spells are variable, the words are less important than the intent you're powering
    behind them - this is why you can usually guarantee that anybody who tells you
    to use Latin phrases is bluffing. The intent and belief are a form of magic, or
    what's known as manifestation - that, as well as the energy surrounding that via
    the candle, are the two most important things you require if you'd like this to
    work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every 15 - 30 minutes, you need to repeat the chant 3 times and keep the image
    of the individual in your mind again. This is simply to put even more mental power
    behind the spell - do it too often and you'll be exhausted by the end and may
    fail to keep up momentum. There's absolutely no benefit from attempting more than
    3 chants per 15 minutes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whilst waiting between chant sessions, keep aware of the flame and try to clear
    your mind. Be aware of the light from the flame (an easier task with the light
    off, if able), be aware of the scent, the warmth. Warm your fingertips and touch
    them in circles over your heart - feel it. Feel that raw energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The spell is not over until the candle has naturally burnt down, and relighting
    is not advisable. Try to get it done in one session, and under no circumstances
    should you ever use a candle for multiple spells, even if you extinguish it between
    uses. This will confuse the energy and could weaken both spells far too heavily
    to make the process worth your while.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the candle has burnt, if there's still melted wax, tip some onto the sheet
    of paper - it shouldn't burn if you're gentle, it'll just dry onto the sheet.
    If the wax isn't wet enough and has dried too quickly, don't worry too much. Just
    discard the candle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In either case, do not let the paper get destroyed until after the spell's results
    have begun to surface.
