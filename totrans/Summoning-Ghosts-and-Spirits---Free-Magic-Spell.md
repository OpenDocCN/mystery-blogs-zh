''I call upon the ghost/spirit of __________''(The one you want to call)
You can call everyone you want.(Excample.If you have a cousin or a family member that is dead,you can summon his spirit and ask him/her everything you want)You chant is three times.While you are saying theese words,remember to spin the needle with your hand(only 1 hand)
