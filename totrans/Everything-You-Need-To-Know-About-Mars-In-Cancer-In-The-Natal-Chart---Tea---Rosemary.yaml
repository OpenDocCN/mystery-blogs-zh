    of accomplishing tasks, and our attraction to others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because Mars rules action, he is considered to be in his “fall” or “depression”
    when Mars is in Cancer. I like to say that Mars is staying at his mom’s house
    when he’s in Cancer.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Mars in Cancer, you move slowly. You gently test the waters and almost
    never dive into something headfirst. You have trouble with change and don’t like
    things to develop rapidly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be difficult for you to try something new as you tend to be inhibited
    by insecurity. Your emotions motivate you to be driven; you’re not motivated by
    facts or logic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you feel threatened, you quite literally freeze and loose your drive altogether.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Mars in Cancer, you may have a large drive for helping others (the homeless,
    in philanthropy, with your family, etc.) but struggle to find your own drive for
    *yourself. *Anyone would be lucky to have you on their side!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    be defensive and alternate between behind-the-scenes manipulation tactics and
    dramatic emotion displays.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but this is the goal if you want to regulate your outbursts. You probably have
    trouble venting in a healthy manner, so the emotions build up then flood out of
    you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that those with Mars in Cancer struggle when they’re emotionally upset
    in other ways, too. Turbulent emotions mess with their willpower and drive and
    zap them in many areas of their lives. These folks first need to deal with their
    emotions and settle issues within themselves before they can be strong.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to be right.
  prefs: []

    Mars shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it does
    for someone with more feminine energy.
  prefs: []

    I recommend reading the description of each energy for Mars in Cancer (below)
    and choosing what resonates with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, in a man (or someone with masculine energy), Mars will show how the
    person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person is
    flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Mars in Cancer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    they are attracted to. How this person will act depends on their Venus sign, but
    Mars dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a partner.

    definitely show my Venus sign when I’m flirting, but sometimes my Mars will bleed
    through just a bit. I find these definitions to be about 80% accurate, but we’re
    always a unique combination of all of our signs.
