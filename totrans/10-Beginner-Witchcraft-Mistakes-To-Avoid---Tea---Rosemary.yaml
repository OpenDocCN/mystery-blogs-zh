    so much information out there and a lot of it is contradictory!

    about. While making mistakes is never a bad thing because we always learn from
    them, these are all simple fixes that change the *outcome* of your spells.

    spells as a beginner *or* advanced witch!

- en: 11\. Expecting A Spell To Work Without Any Real World Effort
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While magic is certainly *magical, *a spell won’t work if you ignore the “real
    world effort” while you’re waiting for your spell to take effect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, let’s imagine that you cast a money spell, yet you never leave
    your home, refuse to get a job, and ignore any opportunities that come your way.
    The spell can’t *possibly* work because the Universe can only bring you money
    through *normal* means.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve cast a spell, you need to make sure you’re doing everything you
    can to help it along and that you’re keeping all doors open.

- en: 10\. Spending Too Much Money On Supplies
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beginner witches can easily get overwhelmed because many spells call for *so
    many* supplies. If you’re just starting out, I don’t recommend spending hundreds
    of dollars on supplies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, think about the most basic supplies that you need. It’s pretty easy
    to start off with candles (for candle spells), string (for knot spells), incense,
    and crystals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have tried a few spells, you’ll start to figure out what types of spells
    you enjoy and you can invest money specifically in those supplies. Try out candle
    spells, jar spells, bath spells, potions, etc., then narrow down based on what
    feels right and what spells are the most successful for you.
  prefs: []

- en: 9\. Not Using Enough Supplies
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, you do need *some* supplies to practice witchcraft. If a spell
    calls for basil and cinnamon, you can’t just throw black salt in the mix instead
    and expect it to work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You certainly *can* substitute ingredients, but you need to use ingredients
    that work for the same types of spells. Money ingredients can be substituted for
    other money ingredients in a spell; substituting and ingredient that signifies
    psychic potential probably *won’t* work.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of beginner witches jump right in and cast spells, then sit around and
    wait. This is all good, but to successfully cast a spell you need to *raise energy.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you start spellcasting, or even during, make sure that you practice raising
    energy. Your spell won’t work without it!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a significant amount of energy and put so much more into the spell.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Defensive spells don’t feel *fun,* but it also isn’t fun to leave yourself vulnerable
    and then get psychically attacked. Defensive spells are necessary for a reason!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re just beginning, you need to *at the very least* [cast a circle before
    practicing magic](https://teaandrosemary.com/how-to-cast-a-circle/). Do this until
    you’re absolutely confident that you can work without it! I personally still [cast
    a circle](https://teaandrosemary.com/how-to-cast-a-circle/) before I practice
    *any* kind of magic.
  prefs: []

    about other basic defensive magic practices.

- en: 6\. Casting Spells You Don’t Care About
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my personal experience, casting a spell you don’t really care about won’t
    yield results. Your spell needs to *matter* in order to put enough energy into
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have tried casting minuscule spells just because I wanted to practice magic,
    but if I don’t really care about the outcome, it just doesn’t work. Subconsciously,
    I can’t be bothered to put enough energy into the spell and I rarely get any outcome
    at all.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s *so much information* out there that it’s easy to get stuck in the research
    phase. You certainly *do* need to read and learn before you jump right into casting
    spells, but you also need to just practice. There’s no better way to learn than
    to do!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I recommend doing a bit of research about the basics, gathering a few tools,
    and trying out some spells. In between spells, spend more time doing research,
    then try another spell. I find that a bit of give-and-take works well!

    we want (even though I wish we could!). Magic takes *time* because it does have
    to follow the laws of the Universe.

    of when you can expect the spell to work while you’re casting it.
  prefs: []

    out why your spell didn’t work](https://teaandrosemary.com/3-easy-ways-to-know-if-a-spell-worked/)

    random spells that I try out work insanely well!
  prefs: []

    it) and that also seems logical. Before trying out a spell, do a bit of research.
    Look into the ingredients used in the spell: are they traditionally used for this
    type of magic?'
  prefs: []

- en: Make sure the wording to the spell is specific and feels right. If it doesn’t,
    go right ahead and change it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of the day, use both logic *and* intuition when you’re picking out
    a spell recipe, and change anything in the ingredients list that doesn’t sit well
    with you. This is especially true if you’re casting [hexes and jinxes](https://teaandrosemary.com/curses-hexes-and-jinxes-whats-the-difference/),
    because these types of spells can easily backfire.

    opinions on how to practice the craft!

    true for *you*, but it won’t work for someone else. Everything in witchcraft is
    personalized.

    anything cast with a negative intention (such as a jinx or hex) will spring back
    on the caster three times over.

    follow it at all. Many witches are somewhere in between.

- en: 1\. Using Affirmations Instead Of Witchcraft
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Witchcraft involves the practice of magic and the use of spells. This means
    that you need to physically cast a spell *as well as* summon energy and state
    your intention.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To cast a spell, you need to perform some type of action. It doesn’t always
    have to involve tools or ingredients, but spells often do because the tools you
    use release extra energy to aid in your spellcasting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many beginner witches fall into the trap of assuming that affirmations or intention
    is witchcraft. This isn’t the case! You need to summon energy from resources,
    such as a candle flame or herbs from the earth. The idea behind witchcraft is
    that this extra energy *combined with* your intention will be enough to successfully
    cast the spell.
