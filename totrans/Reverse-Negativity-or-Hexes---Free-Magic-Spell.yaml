- en: I like this spell, but I do not feel it works as outlined. ''All blocks are
    now removed'' is not a reversal per say. It can work as a way to clear obstacles
    when achieving a goal, but that would be a success spell. It would not send energy
    back at someone who hexed you, merely sweep it away. Also, you need to be sure
    the obstacle to your success is not you. Just as someone could unintentionally
    hex themselves, people can self-sabotage. If you are procrastinating and cast
    this spell, be prepared to pay. Meaning, if you spend all day on TikTok instead
    of studying, do not be surprised if your phone suddenly breaks.
