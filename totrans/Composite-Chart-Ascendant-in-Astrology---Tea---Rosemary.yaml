- en: Composite charts are midpoint charts between two people and can tell you a lot
    about your relationship with another person. Unlike synastry, which looks at both
    people’s charts together and tells you the different aspects *between people,*
    composite charts look at the *relationship chart*.

    accurately, the midpoint (or meeting point) between the two separate people. This

    the perception that the world gets from the couple.

    bold. This is a couple whose issues will present on the outside, but who will
    appear to be very warm and passionate regardless. They are not afraid to talk
    about their good and bad times. Composite Ascendant Aries couples are very take-charge,

    and very bold about what they are and what they are not. There are no nuances,

    together. They like consistency and they do not appreciate changes that catch

    relationship and never actually make those changes. This is a very secure and
    stable relationship, and often if it ends, the world won’t understand why. One

    or physical. They are logical, quick witted, and very fun to be around, though
    it may not make sense that they would actually be romantic together to others.

    two are flexible with each other and there are never control issues from an outside

    One minute they will seem incredibly happy together, and the next it is as if
    the relationship is the worst thing that has ever been thrust upon them. This
    is because the relationship is ruled almost entirely by both people’s mental bodies,
    and the mental body is the fastest changing of any of our four bodies.

    These two people are very sensitive to each other, and it feels as though they
    bring out the most insecure parts in each other. They may have small fights or
    emotional battles often because managing these responses to each other can be
    very difficult. Composite Ascendant Cancer couples are reactive, but unlike Composite
    Ascendant Aries couples, their reactions are not angry, but are rather emotional.

    won’t see them out and about very often. They enjoy the comfort of their own home,
    and each other’s embrace more than other couples, and may become a bit reclusive
    if they are not careful. Large changes or life altering decisions make this couple
    feel very insecure– they like consistency, and they like things to stay the same.

    comfort, home, and consistency. However,  rather than Composite Ascendant Taurus
    couples, who find their security in stability, Composite Ascendant Cancer couples
    find their security in their emotional connectivity. If one of them begins to
    pull away emotionally, even for a family event or personal issue, the other is
    left feeling incredibly insecure which may lead to problems within the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    They value familiarity and comfort, so they will become less insecure over time.
    Additionally, if these two people are able to emotionally support each other and
    open up to each other through the chaos that is life, their relationship will
    strengthen. Each time they support each other, they get stronger, and each time
    they close off to each other, they get weaker.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way this relationship may manifest is that they may be afraid to address
    their issues out of fear of losing the other person. This can lead to rather moody
    reactions between the two people, and often a sulky environment that leads to
    more issues in the future. It is best to express these emotions rather than to
    let them build up, and to learn to intuit each others moods. The cancer ascendant
    means that you have the capability of being extremely sensitive and intuitive
    to each other’s moods and emotions when you want to be.

    outside of their romantic one, the Composite Ascendant Leo couple tempers their
    pride in their own relationship.
  prefs: []

    do struggle with. They may not want to admit when something isn’t working, which
    may lead them to forcing issues to work instead of getting to the root of the
    problem. This couple should be careful not to get too prideful of the appearance
    of their relationship– the value of the relationship is in the work that you put
    into it, not how pretty you look together or how it looks from the outside. Not
    wanting to admit that something is wrong does not mean that everything is right.

    can describe, but both play into it to an extent. They are prideful and protective
    of their relationship, which can actually be derived from a degree of insecurity
    if the couple is not careful. They need to bolster each other up, make each other *feel
    important*, instead of just trying to look important. By fostering creativity,
    love, and joy, and continuing to be playful with each other, this couple can be
    more secure and therefore less possessive of one another.

    each other, hating each other for the small details of who they are rather than
    seeing the big picture. They tend to try to find fault in each other, as they
    think that there is always someone “to blame.” This comes from a fear of their
    own imperfection, so they attempt to pin that imperfection on the other person.
    It is important that this couple learns to be kind to one another, and know that
    just because it is not the other person’s fault does not mean it is their own.

    what to portray to the public, and how to handle each other’s families. These

    or unique in your appearance as a couple, or it may simply be that from the outside,
    others cannot understand your relationship.

- en: As a couple, the Composite Ascendant in Aquarius couple comes off as objective
    and rational, but a bit aloof. Like Composite Ascendant in Gemini couples, these
    two may appear more as friends/acquaintances than in a romantic relationship.
    They appear emotionally detached from one another.

- en: With Leo in the 7th house of the relationship, there is often a leader and a
    follower in the relationship– which can lead to incredible power struggles. Both
    people in a Composite Ascendant Aquarius relationship are individuals, and they
    pride themselves on being so. But the shadow side of the relationship is that
    secretly, one or both people may want to change or control the other.

    from one another. The outside world often cannot understand what actually keeps
    them together.

- en: Because Aquarius is a fixed sign, Composite Ascendant Aquarius couples have
    a hard time embracing change in their relationship, and they typically are as
    they’ve always been. Both people need to learn to be a little more dynamic in
    the relationship, so they can have the personal freedom that a Composite Ascendant
    Aquarius relationship requires.

- en: Composite Ascendant in Pisces couples are that couple that seems *meant to be*.
    With Neptune ruling the ascendant, these couples are dynamic, adaptive, and mystical
    in the way they interact with each other. There is a very dreamy feeling to this
    couple, almost as if they are living in their own world together– and its a side
    of them that often only comes out when they are together.

- en: These couples bring out the artistic sides of each other, and are compassionate
    and caring towards each other. They tend to give each other the benefit of the
    doubt instead of nit-picking and judging every little thing.

- en: The Composite Ascendant Pisces couple rarely brings up negative feelings in
    each other– but they may be avoidant of conflict as a result. With Virgo in the
    7th house of the relationship, their shadow side is their secret judgments and
    fears of themselves and the other person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of this warm and empathetic side comes from that fear or insecurity– they
    are constantly worrying that they will not be *good enough* for the other person,
    which changes the way they act around each other.

- en: However, the Composite Ascendant in Pisces couple is incredibly kind to one
    another as a result. They stick together when times are tough, although they may
    be a bit secretive about their relationship or within it– again, trying not to
    upset their partner or get judgment from the outside world.

- en: This couple puts each other up on a pedestal, and tends to idealize the other
    person. This may lead to not living in reality, or thinking that everything is
    going to be okay without taking active steps to make sure it is. This couple may
    have blinders on, and even gloss over the bad things in the relationship to keep
    it working.

- en: you are warm, tender, and sympathetic towards one another, ultimately giving
    each other the benefit of the doubt. There is a dreamy aura about you. Others
    may even envy you as a result, but rarely do you inspire bad feelings. Kindness
    and good humor dominate the energies of this relationship. You are not ones to
    fight or put each other down when times are tough. There may be a secretive quality
    to your relationship. Idealizing each other is great unless it’s taken to an extreme.
    You easily put the blinders on and gloss over the bad stuff. Although you may
    dream a lot together, putting plans into action is your weak point.
