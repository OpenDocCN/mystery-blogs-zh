- en: It is difficult when a relationship does not work out. This spell will help
    you to move on, even if it is not easy. Wait until the moon wanes; consequently,
    you can also do this spell right after a new moon appears. You’ll need a root
    of bittersweet; be very careful, because this is poisonous. If you do not want
    to work with it, you can select something to use in lieu of it.

    can withstand fire, a root of bittersweet, and a small red bag (preferably velvet).

    think about your heartache and visualize it leaving your body, joining the smoke
    and then drifting off into the atmosphere. As this is happening, you can chant
    the following words:'

    Exercising great care, hold the bittersweet and move it against your solar plexus.
    Picture any bad feelings that you have left moving into the root. Once you feel
    better, take the root and tap it lightly against your forehead. This symbolizes
    that your bad feelings have been vanquished and you are now lighter as a result.

    town, take the bag with you and find a place to bury it. Bring a photograph of
    your ex along as well, and after you bury the bag, think good thoughts of your
    former love.
