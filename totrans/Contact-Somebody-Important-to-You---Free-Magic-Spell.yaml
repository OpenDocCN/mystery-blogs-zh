    Sit cross-legged, take a few, deep breathes. Focus on your breath. Realize that
    on a basic level you are alive, and breathing. Focus on each part of your body
    individually. Start from the bottom parts of your body (like feet, legs) and slowly
    go up to the top of your head. Experience all the feelings flowing from your whole
    body.

    colors. Suddenly light is slowly covering your entire body. You may feel excitement,
    ecstasy, but that can also be silence or stillness. Turn around. There's a door.
    Go through it. Visualize yourself entering the persons room, seeing them inside
    just sitting and doing what they do on a daily basis. You can now talk to them.
    If should not seem to pay attention to you while you are being there. If they
    respond you in any way, it means the visualization has failed, but you can try
    again later. This might need practice and proper. After you had said everything,
    go back to the white room and open your eyes. Blow out the candle.
