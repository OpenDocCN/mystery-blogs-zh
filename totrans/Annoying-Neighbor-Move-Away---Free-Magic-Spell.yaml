    art is okay if that is the best you can do. The first night draw your neighbor's
    (current) house with them doing the annoying types of things they do. Make it
    complete even if it's simple art. Put in the trees, windows, and the like. When
    you are done, wait for the end of the 30 minutes, concentrating on the candle
    flame and your goal. Fold the paper up and tear it to small shreds. Put out your
    candle (and close your circle if you created one. Save the torn scraps of paper.

    change. On the second day, draw them excited and happy in front of their current
    house -- because they've found a better one. For the rest of the week, draw them
    carrying various stuff out of their current house (as if they were moving). The
    key thing here is only show there current house. You don't want to limit possibilities
    by drawing a new house for them.

    need to include a portion from each if you need to keep the envelope small.
