    items for this spell:** "I conjure thee, O spirit (name of the spirit), by all
    the most glorious and efficacious Names of the Great and Incomparable Lord the
    God of Hosts, come quickly and without delay, from whatsoever part of the world
    thou art in; make rational answers to my demands. Come visibly, speak affably,

    Names, as also by those seven other Names wherewith Solomon bound thee and thy
    fellows in the brazen vessels to wit. Adonai, prerai, tetragrammation, anexhexeton,
    inessensatoal, pathumaton and itemon: do thou manifest before this circle, fulfil
    my will in all things that may seem good to me.'

    Lord, that God Who created thee and me, the whole world, with all contained therein,
    in the space of six days; by eye, by saray, by the virtue of the Name primeatum,
    which commands the whole host of Heaven. Be disobedient, and behold I will curse
    and deceive thee of thine office, thy joy and thy place. I will bind thee in the
    depths of the bottomless pit, there to remain until the Day of the Last judgment.
    I will chain thee in the Lake of Eternal Fire, in the Lake of Fire and Brimstone,
    unless thou come quickly, appearing before this circle, to do my will"
