# History of Witchcraft - Witchcraft

> 来源：[https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history/#0001-01-01](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history/#0001-01-01)

Some claim that witchcraft dates back to [**pre-history**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-ancient/). Others allege that what we generally consider witchcraft developed in pre-Christian Celtic times. Either way, the best known period in the history of witchcraft is the late [**Middle Ages**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-medieval/) and [**Early Modern**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-early-modern/) period during which time hundreds of thousands of (alleged) witches were tried and tens of thousands burned by the Christian authorities in Europe’s infamous [**witch trials**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/trials/). It was only in the [**20th Century**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-modern/) that witchcraft saw a resurgence.

I will look at the History of Witchcraft under four main periods:

[**Ancient Period**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-ancient/) | [**Medieval Period**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-medieval/) | [**Early Modern Period**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-early-modern/) | [**Modern Period**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-modern/)
