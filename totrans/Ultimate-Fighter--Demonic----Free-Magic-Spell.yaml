- en: I could be from Tekken or Chuck Norris can I? All by demons and analysis no
    less. While visualization and using a character as an archetype can help motivate
    you to work harder and achieve a goal, you are not transforming into that character
    because that's not how magick works.
  prefs: []

- en: You're not transforming into the character you're being possessed these demons
    are giving you the ability to fight like the character in it is possible people
    get possessed everyday and didn't take control the body's people that don't know
    how to control the demons so don't sit there and say it's not possible when it
    is very possible

- en: You know I'm starting to see a pattern here I've read a lot of your post a lot
    of your comments and the reason why your magic doesn't work why you said everything
    is not possible is because you're so negative all the time is why your magic don't
    work she's a thing about being a black magic as you have no rules anything goes
    everything works
  prefs: []

- en: I wasn't being negative, I explained you can use this to motivate or empower
    you, but you will not physically become it. this spell doesn't call on demons,
    you don't have to work with demons for your spells to work [you don't need to
    work with any spiritual being for spells to work] and I've never had an issue
    with any spell I've cast. they've all been highly successful, I just choose carefully,
    and I understand magick so I don't waste my energy on things that don't work.
    I am rather positive, but I identify as a realist. I have contributed many working
    spells to the site, guided users on their path, and commented on working spells
    as many times as I've commented on fake spells [people simply enjoy yelling at
    me on the spells I explain don't work] if I can find a way to make a spell work,
    I will try [see above when I expressed visualization and working with archetypes]
    as for my magick, it works for me. magick is intent, not colour, but if I was
    to put colour to my path, it would be grey. I lean more towards the positive [white]
    spells, but if the situation calls for it, I don't mind cursing, however, magick
    is about balance, there's light in dark, and dark in light. Find the balance.
    That's my path at least.
