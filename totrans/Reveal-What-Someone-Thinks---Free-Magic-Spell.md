 Cast a circle and light the candle, charging it with your intentions. Light it for truth and for mental illumination. Visualise a clear picture of the person in your mind because it's very important.
Write on a piece of paper I wish that what this person thinks of me be revealed in my dreams.
Fold rosemary or if you're using any other herb in the paper so that it is tightly bound, and then carefully light the paper and put it in the flameproof dish. As it burns, visualise that's person's face again and focus intently on what you want.
Speak the following words:

> **"With dreamers eyes I seek to see
> What this person thinks of me.
> Be it good or be it ill
> Reveal to me as is my will."**

When the rosemary and paper stop burning, snuff out the candle or let it burn out and go to sleep. You will receive the answer to your question in your dreams.
