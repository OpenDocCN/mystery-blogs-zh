## Is Today Your Birthday?

A Venus-Jupiter link on your birthday is a marvelous omen for the year ahead, especially for friendships and affairs of the heart. Make a point of being generous in all one-to-one dealings, and the universe with reward you with happiness and success.

### AQUARIUS

The more you try to control a situation the more likely it is to move in directions you don’t want it to go, so relax and let life come to you. Also, don’t worry if you have to pay out more than you expected today. Think of it as an investment.

### PISCES

The approaching full moon warns that friends and colleagues will disagree with your plans over the next two or three days. You will have to decide whether to move ahead without them or to take their advice and wait. Be confident and act alone.

### ARIES

What takes place today and tomorrow, while the moon is full, may not be to your liking but don’t kick up a fuss about it. Powerful forces are at work and the last thing you want is the spotlight on you. Stay in the shadows if you can.

### TAURUS

Try to align yourself with a higher cause over the next 48 hours. In some small way you can help change the world for the better, and in doing so it will help you feel better about yourself too. Your passion will make a difference.

### GEMINI

The upcoming full moon makes this a great time to clear out all the material and emotional junk you have acquired in recent months. Be ruthless: get rid of anything that is not absolutely necessary in your life. You may be surprised how much that is.

### CANCER

Don’t waste time trying to predict what is going to happen next in your life – it could be anything! Just be ready to adapt and to act at a moment’s notice. The next few days will be both exciting and challenging. Can you stand the pace?

### LEO

You may be tempted to give up on something (or someone) that is costing you a lot more time and money than you expected, but don’t be hasty. According to the planets some sort of breakthrough is imminent, emotionally and maybe financially too.

### VIRGO

You must not be content to sit back and let life come to you. Get out there into the big bad world and make things happen the way you want them to happen. The approaching full moon is sure to bring doubts but you must ignore them.

### LIBRA

The thing about change is that it is so unpredictable and what happens over the next two or three days is sure to take you by surprise. Don’t try to resist what happens – go with the flow and let it guide you. You will benefit in interesting ways.

### SCORPIO

There seems to be an added urgency to your activities at the moment, no doubt caused by the approaching full moon. Something is prompting you to get a move on and make your mark before the opportunity passes and is gone for good. So get going!

### SAGITTARIUS

Unexpected events at home and at work may catch you out today but they will benefit you in the long-term so don’t get uptight about them. Deep down you knew all along that things could not continue as they are, so embrace change, don’t fight it.

### CAPRICORN

Something good is about to happen but it may not seem good to you in the short-term. Whatever occurs over the next 24 to 48 hours you are strongly advised to accept it and look for ways to make it work for you. Try being a bit more flexible.
