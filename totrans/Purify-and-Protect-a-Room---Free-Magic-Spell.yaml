- en: This is a relatively harmless spell. Nothing can really go wrong besides it
    not working. However, I have a casual approach to spells, and in most of my spells
    you will see they do not have any specific chant. You should go with whatever
    feels right. Remember to listen to your feelings, and the spell should work.

    shaped room, just make sure you put one penny on either side of all entrances
    to the room. (Don't forget windows!)

- en: 2\. Cast a circle with the five candles as you normally would. Since I prefer
    to choose my own words, remember to be respectful and grateful and list one way
    each element you summon helps you, then politely ask for assistance. Air should
    be the first to enter the circle and the last to leave it.

- en: 3\. Explain that you need help protecting this room. If you prefer, this is
    the time when you may sprinkle powdered lemon rind around the circle for clarity,
    to help you see exactly what you need to purify the room from and protect against.

- en: 4\. Dismiss the elements in the same way you summoned them, respectfully and
    gratefully. The room should now be cleansed of all negativity, and can now be
    used as a protective shell of sorts for whoever often occupies the room.
