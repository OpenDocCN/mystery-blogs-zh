  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Seiðr is believed to have originated in the pre-Christian, Indo-European culture
    of the Norse and Germanic peoples. The earliest written records of seiðr come
    from the 13th century, in the form of sagas and Eddic poetry. However, it is likely
    that the practice dates back much further, to a time before the arrival of Christianity
    in Scandinavia.

    women were believed to possess special powers, such as the ability to see into
    the future or to control the elements. They were also thought to be able to heal
    the sick and to curse or bless individuals or communities.
