    items for this spell:**Although with popularity, Maneki Neko, the Japanese beckoning
    cat, has been adapted to other uses, her primary purpose is to generate cash for
    her owner. This amulet depicts a seated cat holding one hand up in the gesture
    that in Japan indicates, ''''come here!'''' Maneki Neko'' s upraised left hand
    beckons increased business while the upraised right hand demands cash. Allegedly
    the more higher the hand, the more powerful the amulet.'

    and Japanese restaurants. It can be used to bring good fortune to you, but you
    would need to cleanse and dedicate it for that purpose as well as place it in
    the right spot in your home. Simply buying a statue will not bring good luck.
