Do have light the stick on fire or can do something else if can't light things on fire

I doubt this works. You suspect someone might be harmful, and your conformation bias will give you that uneasy feeling. You can use divination and energy work to sense someones intentions, but there is no guarantee since some humans can hide these intentions incredibly well. Especially if they understand how Magik works.
