- en: Going through a divorce tends to be a difficult time for both partners and isn’t
    always as smooth as you wish it would be. Hearts are broken, hopes are shuttered,
    and the future remains uncertain – all those factors contribute to significant
    grief and sense of emptiness. One of the worst things that can happen to a witch
    is falling into a downward spiral of shame, self-loathing and blame whilst going
    through a divorce. To address this issue, a special bond-breaking ritual can be
    performed.

    the divorce that you wish to work through during the ritual, and why. For instance,
    you may wish to observe feelings of attachment, sadness and grief, and attempt
    to let go of them.

    lights.

- en: With your red-ink pen, write “I release [name] from my soul” 9 times horizontally,
    and 9 times vertically on the piece of parchment, starting each sentence on a
    new line and keeping the gaps consistent. When your intention paper is complete,
    hold it for a few minutes with your eyes closed and focus on your intentions.
    Then, cut the paper with your scissors into the smallest possible pieces. The
    shreds are to be buried under an old tree.
