- en: if you wish to keep trying, go for it. just don't stubbornly stick to a mindset
    if you've discovered a different viewpoint. When I started out, I thought I could
    control elements if I concentrated enough and move objects with my mind. I discovered
    while I could make a candle flame flicker, or if I focused enough energy I could
    affect the weather, the ability to control the elements with my mind wasn't possible.
    I felt silly for believing it, but after discovering what was possible, I could
    focus on working spells and improve my craft. If you still have your doubts that
    what we're saying isn't true, keep researching and trying [just avoid any spell
    that promotes things like self-harm or drinking something which would make you
    sick]
