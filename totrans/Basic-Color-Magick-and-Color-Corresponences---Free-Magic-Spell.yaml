- en: Color Magic refers to the combined magical and psychological effects of color(s)
    while working spells. Psychologists have only recently begun studying the effects
    that color has on people, but magicians and alchemists have known of the power
    of color for centuries.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using specific colors when performing rituals is not necessary. Using colors
    that correspond to the purpose of the spell or ritual can, however, vastly enhance
    its power. The easiest way to bring color magic into your ritual is to use candles.
    If you frequently perform rituals for a specific purpose, you may want to invest
    in candle holders, altar cloth, or other ritual supplies in the appropriate color(s).
    Many traditions favor ritual tools in black and white to avoid confused messages
    during rituals (among other reasons - see List of Color Magic Correspondences
    below).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When discussing how to use a particular magical tool, you will often hear about
    its correspondences. A correspondence is simply what something is used for. You
    would say, for example ''White corresponds with purity'' or ''Black corresponds
    with grounding''. Most magical tools (colors, herbs, crystals, symbols, etc) have
    more that one correspondence, so it is still important to use your will and visualizations
    no matter how many extra tools you have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, correspondences (color magic correspondences in particular) are seldom
    absolute. When you choose your tools, make sure that the color matches the purpose
    in your mind. Green, for example, can symbolize both sickness and health. For
    healing, you would choose a healthy green. For repulsion spells (like a ''Get
    this negative person out of my life'' spell), you would want a sickly green.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: White corresponds to spirituality, cleansing, purity, perfection, innocence,
    integrity, healing, freedom, opportunity, forgiveness, and acceptance. It is also
    a color of simple power. White carries the powers of all the colors. It can be
    directed towards almost any use, and can enhance the power of other color magic
    in spell work. It helps eliminate negative energy and creates inner peace. It
    is used by many cultures in purification rituals. It also corresponds to the Maiden
    form of the Triple Goddess.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Black corresponds to death, the Underworld, grounding, stability, mystery, and
    witchcraft. Black absorbs negative energy. Many people shy away from using black
    in magic, even going as far as to say ''never use black''. I do not hold to this.
    With its powerful associations to mystery and the underworld, black makes a powerful
    addition to any spell of divination or protection. Black is the color of the Crone
    aspect of the Triple Goddess.

    of the Mother Aspect of the Triple Goddess.

    cheerfulness, intellect, hope, direction, personal power, clear thinking, concentration,
    fruitfulness, and communication. It can also correspond to fear and treachery
    (this can be useful for banishing them). This is a case where the shade of color
    can make a big difference: Bright yellows tend to carry the positive aspects,
    while pale or muddy yellows tend to carry the negative.'

    Dirty or muddy green corresponds to envy, hate, and sickness (a ''sickly green'',

    appear along with blue. Green is especially useful in color magic spells for healing
    and for wealth drawing.
