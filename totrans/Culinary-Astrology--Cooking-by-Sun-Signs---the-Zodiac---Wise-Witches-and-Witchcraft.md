## What’s Cooking?

There are many languages of love. We believe that cooking is one of them. Food expresses our passions, thoughts, feelings without any words whatsoever. Cooking also lets us show our friends, family, dates, partners and children that we care by fine tuning recipes until they fit personal tastes. There’s something wonderful about a home cooked meal any day, let alone on special occasions. What if you could make your pantry into a Kitchen Witch – type place house where you sprinkle in a little Zodiac zeal?

### Savory Stars

Culinary Astrology builds on the idea of keying in on each sign’s characteristics. Then we use that information as a building block for any snack or meal. Obviously *asking* people what they may like helps, but using a little celestial know-how can help too!

Think of it this way. Everyone has specific ways they prefer their food prepared. Everyone has unique tastes. What we find in the Zodiac is that some Sun Signs are refined eaters (and often fantastic chefs). Others have a more laissez-faire outlook because they’re simply not that picky. Whether you dine out, order in or make it yourself, you want good results. Many people already check their horoscope for all manner of advice, so why not food?

Let’s take a look, sign by sign.

## Aries the Ram: March 21- April 19

The Ram is full of energy so they’re not “sit down” eaters for the most part. That doesn’t mean they don’t love flavor, rather they simply want to be able to enjoy it on the go! Don’t worry about silk napkins and candles, just hand them a good paper towel, well made finger food, and a tall dark beer. The more fun the food is, and often the spicier, the faster it goes straight to the Ram’s heart.

If you go to a friends’ work place and the first thing you find at their desk is hot sauce, they’re probably an Aries. Hot sauce is suitable for everything! Other rich herbs dot the pantry shelves too – think Indian and Tai, both of which can pack a real WOW factor. For beverages, spicy vegetable juice in the morning, followed by a drive-through espresso get the morning off to a perfect high-power start (red tie not required).

If your partner (or prospective love partner) is an Arian they’re likely very charismatic and curious. They love to play games, so keep your cooking whimsical! Food that speaks to all the senses somehow – if it sizzles, smells great, looks beautiful on the plate, can be fed to each other, and of course tantalizes the tongue… well, that’s one sure way to go right to the Ram’s heart.

### Where’s the Beef?

You will rarely find an Aries that chooses a vegetarian lifestyle. These are meat and potato folk. Pull out good hamburgers or steak and watch a smile appear. That type of food disappears nearly as quickly as you place it on the table. The only time Aries is quiet at dinner is when they’re chowing down, and quickly at that. If you’re looking for Ms. Or Mr. Manners – don’t invite a Ram for chow. They get hungry regularly, and want food ready in that moment.

### Aries in the Kitchen

As cooks, they rush and often drop pots and pans or slip with a knife. The food they prepare for themselves and others has a high protein content to support their high-energy lifestyle. Throughout the preparation process, our Ram nibbles. This is as much for checking taste as it is a natural habit.

### Feeding your Aries

Think rich smells and flavors when creating your menu. Stuffed jalapenos, hearty parsnip soup, pepper steak, Margarita shrimp, barbecue *anything* and fiery Asian salad are all good examples. If you can make a Flambe for dessert, all the better.

**Aries Food Staples:**

Black olives

Beans

Paprika

## Taurus the Bull: April 20-May 20

The Bull has the most refined palate in the Zodiac. The phrase “picky eater” applies fully here. If you are entertaining a Taurus do not skimp on sale items unless you want a dinner-lecture on improving your recipe (with footnotes). Fresh spices, organic meats and farmer’s market produce truly inspire the Taurus tummy.

### Ambiance for Taurus Meals

The atmosphere for eating is just as important as the food itself. The Bull prefers a laid back surrounding where he can eat slowly, savoring every bite. Picnics suit Taurus’ earthy nature perfectly. If weather doesn’t allow how about creating an indoor picnic or Oriental low-table style fare? Just remember the pillows!

### Taurus in the Kitchen

The Bull is not the most creative of cooks. They stick with tested and trusted recipes. Their patience makes them good bakers (and since they like sweets – that’s a bonus). Don’t be fooled by what seems simple – these dishes will be wonderful. The Taurus cook spends a lot of time paying attention to details. The end product will look like a masterpiece on the plate.

### Feeding your Taurus

If you know your Taurus’ taste in comfort food, definitely include at least one of those items on your menu. By the way, don’t ask your Bull over for just a snack. Tea and cookies do not begin to satisfy a Taurus’ tastes or appetites.

Speaking of appetite watch your portion control. Taurus tends to over-eat. If you hope for something after dinner other than napping, keep the helpings reasonable.

For the recipes themselves try and find blends that carefully layer flavor and texture. Some ideas include Greek salad, Au gratin potatoes (use Fontina, Asiago, Provolone, Gruyere, Smoked Gouda or any combination), bacon wrapped grilled asparagus (with a squeeze of orange), surf & turf and pear-chocolate tart or lush ice cream.

**Taurus Food Staples:**

Beef
Pasta (especially fresh)
Potatoes
Bread
Buttermilk
Biscuits
Gravy

**Taurus Fruit and Vegetables:**

Apples
Avacado
Banana
Peas

Berries
Tomato (fresh and sun dried)

**Taurus Spices:**

Mint (various types)
Curly Parsley
Cloves,
Dill (fresh)
Fennel
Vanilla
Thyme
Basil

## Gemini: May 21-June 20

Two brains; two eating styles and a lot of times you won’t know which one is at front and center. Overall having snack foods sprinkled around the house makes Gemini happy. They like to nibble their way through the day. This satisfies their need for variety.

One nice thing you can do for your Gemini is making “single serves” – yummy, easy meals with the ingredients you know they like. They’ll still get a decent helping of something before running off and doing that social “thing” Geminis do so well. Don’t feel offended by the eat-and-run. The fact that they stopped to eat is a complement by itself.

### Talk it Up

Where Taurus thinks ambiance, Gemini focuses on discussion and diversity. That means making a tasting table that has place cards with a bit of history behind the dish keeps your Gemini enthralled. Encourage her to share edible memories and ideas too. This sign loves teaching, it doesn’t matter the subject. The small portions of a tasting table also make it easier to keep a conversation going without food in your mouth.

### Gemini in the Kitchen

Most Geminis love to cook, especially if it pampers a friend or loved one. They’re not good at standard fare, tho. If you ask a Gemini how something was made, they’ll give you a rough synopses but can rarely duplicate the results. They often don’t think about the recipe – they dance with it. Gemini cooks also like to make small portions as much as they like eating them.

### Cooking for your Gemini

Every meal needs diversity in textures and flavor profiles. While they may not give all their attention to the food, there is a subconscious positive reaction to this basic approach. Avoid sloppy items – the Twins like wandering during meals, with plate in hand. If you make soup, have clever cups available.

One menu that may please your Gemini would begin with a crispy pickle tray (they love the crunch). Follow that with a lightly dressed cucumber, cherry tomato salad (perhaps with a hint of feta). Your main dish can be strawberry-lavender chicken bites. Dessert? Old fashioned pecan pie with whipped cream.

**Gemini Food Staples:**

Hazelnuts
Walnuts
Yogurt
Grape juice
Wild Rice
Cola
Coffee
Oats

**Gemini Vegetables & Fruits:**

Bananas
Apricot
Broccoli
Green Beans
Cauliflower
Pomegranate
Plum
Oranges
Apples
Carrots
Spinach

**Gemini Spices:**

Cayenne
Garlic
Ginger
Celery seed
Mint
Sesame
Vanilla bean

## Cancer: June 21 – July 22

When you think of the tastes and aromas wafting from a grandmother’s kitchen – that’s exactly what Cancer loves. This kind of menu speaks to the Crab’s passion for security. They crave nurturing, and food is a perfect media. Dairy and starches don’t always sit well, however. Healthy additions to their daily fare include yogurt and eggs.

Cancer has a serious sweet tooth. They always have a stash of candy at the office and one of their favorite boxes tucked away in secret at home. If this is your partner keep your eyes open. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, so they often eat based on how they feel, not just because they’re hungry.

### All Business?

Cancers are very strong in business. Sometimes that seems to completely saturate their daily life. But if a Cancer gets, well, “crabby” one of the best pick-me-ups and distractions is food. This alters their demeanor fairly quickly especially if you make one item that’s just for them (no sharing). If you’re taking that treat to the office, make sure you have the necessary utensils or create happy finger food like watercress finger sandwiches on fresh rye.

### Cancer in the Kitchen

Cancers love to cook and often become well known for their prowess in the kitchen. They always start with the finest ingredients they can afford, pulling out a well-worn cookbook with snipped recipes tucked inside. Cancers are, in part, fantastic chefs because they are passionate foodies. If they make something for you, ask them about it. Every recipe has a tale to tell, usually one filled with family tradition.

### Cooking for your Cancer

The more traditional the fare, the happier Cancer becomes. Have a cup of old fashioned chicken noodle soup as an appetizer. Follow it with a green bean casserole. The main event might be mom’s mac n’ cheese or fried chicken. Top it all off with a fruity cheesecake for dark chocolate brownies.

**Basic Cancer Food Components:**

Cheese
Rice
Oats
Milk
Eggs
Whole grains
Whole wheat flour

**Cancer Vegetables & Fruits:**

Banana
Broccoli
Cabbage
Cauliflower
Cucumbers
Beans
Coconut
Lemon
Potatoes

**Cancer Spices:**

Cinnamon
Sage
Thyme
Vanilla
Horseradish
Rosemary
Parsley
Bay

## Leo: July 22 – August 22

As the King of the jungle, Leo wants what he wants, when he wants it (and it had better be spectacular). When they eat out it’s at high end restaurants known for luxury and a sparkling list of “whose-who” clients. The grander, the better! A dinner-theater show is one example. If there’s any place with a Master Mixologist, Leo will watch in wonder.

Another attraction for Leo in terms of food is exotic or hard to find. Think things like Century Eggs, Durian Fruit, Burek, deep fried alligator or a whole roast pig. Hint: Carbs make the Leo’s world go ’round.

### Lush Leo

### Whether you serve up a cup of tea or a 10 course meal, make it lush. Fancy decorations, pretty table settings, finger bowls .. and by all means get the silverware placed correctly. Always seat your Leo guest at the head of the table or as close to that location as possible. Extra points for excellent food presentation.

### Leo in the Kitchen

Leo doesn’t cook often. However, when the Lion can cook for a group of people, it is sure to please. That meal will be the center of discussion for months to come (Julia Child was a Leo). Anything that can be served flaming is high on the list of menu choices.

### Feeding your Leo

Generally your Lion wants one large meal a day that’s the center of the rest of the routine. If they love the food they may overindulge a bit (including adding wine on the side). Some menu ideas include sliced fresh goat cheese with balsamic, avocado toast, hearty meat chili and watermelon sorbet.

**Leo Food Fundamentals:**

Eggs
Bread
Almonds
Wheat grass
Buckwheat
Meat
Oatmeal

**Leo Fruit and Vegetables:**

Lemon
Peach
Asparagus
Spinach
Blueberrries
Lime
Orange

**Leo Spices:**

Basil
Rosemary
Ginger
Sesame oil
Cinnamon
Garlic
Cumin

## Virgo: August 23 – September 22

Virgo is a pragmatist with food. They can diet if they feel its necessary and never cheat (yes, really!). Once they meet their goal, they’ll create a sensible framework for their meals and probably post it on the refrigerator door. Some Virgos find vegetarian or vegan lifestyles preferable. Since they tend toward a lazy metabolism, this actually helps physically. Their stomachs can also be a tad sensitive, so Virgo eats slowly.

### Health and Nutrition

Unlike some of the other Zodiac signs, Virgo focuses on health more than taste personally. They do not mind being given leftovers or thrifty meals because both have pragmatic foundations. Don’t waste! In fact, Virgos have been known to grab remnant foods and put them in storage containers before they can reach the trash. Foods high in calcium and magnesium support the Virgo physically. Examples include dark greens, soy, whole grains and dark chocolate (who says being health can’t be fun!).

### Virgo in the Kitchen

When it comes to being technical with food – Virgo is your go to gal. They have every kitchen tool you can imagine (do not take them shopping at culinary stores unless you have a huge budget). Virgo is a food chemist. Recipes must be followed exactly. The end result will be something close to miraculous, looking and tasting perfect.

### Cooking for your Virgo

Virgo prefers small portions. Keeping healthy snacks on hand works well for this sign. A potential menu might include stuffed figs, grilled corn salad, cheese souffle and apricot pie.

**Virgo Food Basics:**

Grains
Oats
Juice (real fruit)
Tea
Trail mix

**Virgo Vegetables & Fruits:**

Avocado
Banana
Fruit trail mix
Lemon
Oranges
Greens
Sprouts
Cauliflower
Tomato

**Virgo Spices:**

Bay
Mint
Cinnamon
Rosemary
Juniper
Chicory
Caraway
Dill

## Libra:September 23 – October 22

The peace-loving Libra hates eating alone, making them truly enjoyable at dinner time. If you are the host, everything on your table balances everything else around the room. Be it fresh flowers or other decorative touches, dining with Libra makes you feel pampered with beauty.
Being ruled by Venus, there’s a lot of love energy that should go into Libra’s food. Whatever you do, don’t argue at the table. Libra is fully capable of standing up, putting everything away and calling a family meeting then and there. You will remain hungry till this problem resolves.

### Libra at the Table

If you’ve created an interesting meal, you may want to present it in bite size portions. Libra will ask you questions about every nuance in the food. They are honestly interested. Also the Scales are moderate eaters anyway. Light food is as pleasing as some suitable background music.

### Libra In the Kitchen

Cooking ends up being one of two things for Libra: a grand success or an equally impressive failure. That’s because Libras are emotional and if they cook when upset it simply doesn’t come out right. That upsets our chef even more, because each element should be pleasing and yummy.

Libra is the garnish King of Queen of meals. You may even find lovely edible flowers on your plate dotting salads or soups – carnations, chrysanthemums, Johnny-jump-ups, lilac, nasturtium, rose, squashflower and violets bring a whimsical element to any dish. They smell good and taste great!

They do make wonderful hosts and hostesses. There will be perfect amounts of food for each guest, a nice after dinner wine and a sweet and cheese platter for comfortable socialization. To the Libra, cooking has its own music and they choose to sing along.

### Cooking for your Libra

You don’t need to go heavy on your spices with Libra. If anything choose a reserved, sophisticated approach. Flavors should always balance on this Zodiac sign’s tongue. And by all means make dessert the star of the show. They love their sweets. A sample menu begins with baby shrimp tossed in lemon and basil and a fresh spinach-cranberry salad. Move to a main course of savory crepes, followed by a luscious banana split for dessert. For after-dinner conversation? White wine.

**Libra Food Fundamentals:**

Almonds
Oatmeal
Brown rice
Honey
Vegetable juice
Shellfish
Eggs
Tea

**Libra Fruit and Vegetables:**

Asparagus
Tomato
Parsnip
Peas
Corn
Spinach
Carrots

**Libra Spices:**

Cinnamon
Clove
Fennel
Ginger

## Scorpio

Scorpio is passionate and strong-willed in everything, including their food. They love researching various recipes and unusual foods that reflect their own mysterious ways. It’s not surprising to find the Scorpio wanting rare items like caviar or odd items like snake and snail.

Scorpio has strong ties to the Water element. The sign oversees vineyards, ocean seafood, root vegetables and mushrooms. Most Scorpios lean toward fish over red meat.

### Scorpio and Table Talk

As you serve out your meal, Scorpios will begin asking questions in a light-hearted way. They specifically want all the yummy details of the spices you used in a course they loved. This can become a dinner-time game of sorts (name that spice). However, you might as well just give up and promise to write out the recipe after dinner. They will wiggle it out of you one way or another with their charms.

### Scorpio in the Kitchen

When a Scorpio is cooking, just stay out of the kitchen. Don’t be a “back seat cook” or pick at the food in process. This behavior will get a curt response as you’re shooed away.

Scorpio blends his menu according to personal tastes so its bound to be spicy, unusual or pungent. Items like blue cheese, duck fat fried potatoes, Thai food, and pickled carrots and cauliflower all fit that profile. They also have no hesitation to boil up that live crab or lobster, drenching it in butter.

### Cooking for your Scorpio

Scorpio enjoys high calorie edibles because they get hungry quite frequently. Do not let the cupboards or refrigerator start looking bare. Also be ready to invest heavily in spices and condiments. One sample menu for your Scorpio might start with a variety of sushi. Follow that with braised leaks and bacon. This acts as a side dish to a really moist burger with all the fixings. End your meal with a dessert surprise (like lava cake).

**Scorpio Food Fundamentals:**

Oysters
Cottage cheese
Watercress
Lentils
Soup
Wine
Almonds

**Scorpio Fruits & Vegetables:**

Pumpkin
Artichokes
Mushrooms
Beets
Lemon
Banana
Black Cherry
Coconut
Salads (green)

Tomatoes
Onions

**Scorpio Spices:**

Curry
Garlic
Cinnamon
Vanilla
Basil
Celery Seed
Cloves

## Sagittarius November 22 – December 21

Sagittarius-born people are travelers forever wandering the Earth in search of new experiences and answers to age-old questions. In the kitchen they still probably philosophize about the chicken and the egg! More seriously, because of their worldly experience, The Archer has opened himself to many cultural food venues. Sagittarius also prefers diversity through the week. The same old menu just won’t do. While this may sometimes prove frustrating to the cook of the house, the upside is learning a lot more about global cuisine.

### Pile it Up!

Dainty foods really aren’t the Archer’s style. They want food that has an experiential quality and hardy quantities. Also have dogie bags handy. Should your Sagittarius need to run off (as they often do) they can enjoy the effort on the run. Don’t be insulted by a short visit. You will hear all about the dish enthusiastically later.

### Sagittarius in the Kitchen

While our Archer will cook, he or she really prefers to call the shots in the kitchen. They’ll create a tidy plan and delegate responsibilities suited to each persons’ abilities. They may offer interesting kitchen gadgets into the cooking process, picked up in their travels. Don’t worry. If you get stuck, the Archer will most certainly pitch in as any good teacher might.

### Cooking for your Sagittarius

Create a meal plan suited for outside eating (be it a picnic in the park or a bonfire at the beach). Don’t be afraid to experiment. A Sagittarius will jump in and try this wonderful new flavor experience. If you think of Andrew Zimmerman, you have an idea of how bizarre you can get. On the other hand, for something a little more middle ground open with a chilled ginger squash soup. Your main dish should be grilled, perhaps lamb or pheasant dressed with peach pico-de-gallo coupled with roasted beets. End your meal with flaming Bananas Foster.

**Sagittarius Food Fundamentals:**

Turbot
Tuna
Seeds
Nuts
Whole grains
Bacon
Ham
Endive
Cornish Hen

Squash

Onions
Figs
Cabbage

**Sagittarius Spices:**

Garlic

Saffron

## Capricorn: December 22 – January 19

Capricorns are overly serious and independent. Inevitably they are the realists of the Zodiac, which is a characteristic of Earth signs. In terms of food this translates into what you might call a rather stiff diet. They like tradition and rarely step outside their comfort zones as a result. When you think of the phrase “meat and potatoes” you’re talking about the goat. If you cook hardy and healthy for your Capricorn, you won’t be far off your mark.

### Keep it on Time and Tasty

Virgo does not like things being late. Their entire eating schedule looks like a blueprint. This points back to the idea of tradition. Dinner is at a certain time at the table, with plenty of time for leisurely eating. Use your family’s favorite china and let your Virgo offer menu ideas in advance.

### Capricorn in the Kitchen

Traditional is the name of the game in a Capricorn’s kitchen. They stick pretty much to one culture (or a couple that were evidenced regularly on the family table). They are careful planners, looking for as close to perfection as possible. Many Capricorns enjoy teaching people how to make their family foods too (particularly children).

### Feeding your Capricorn

Capricorn benefits from an iron rich diet that includes liver, oysters, turnip greens and lentils. For a light meal you might start with some tempura fried dill pickles (Capricorn loves salty treats). For a main dish stuff a pita with thinly sliced gouda, sprouts and cucumber ranch dressing. Finish your meal with a sliver of sweet potato pie and a rum with coke.

**Capricorn Food Fundamentals:**

Flax seeds
Tea
Soup
Lentils
Peanuts
Beef

**Capricorn Fruits and Vegetables:**

Tofu

**Capricorn Spices:**

Oregano
Bay
Rosemary
Thyme
Marjoram
Cinnamon
Sage
Cloves

## Aquarius: January 20 – February 18

Aquarius-born people are both energetic and a bit odd. They think about everything in great detail, finding the most amazing possibilities. Mental simulation makes the Water Bearer very happy. SO if there’s a way you can make food that supports improved metabolism, surprises the Aquarian and gives them food for thought you have a winning combination here. Food fads perio create whimsy and health-conscious appetizers and salads are most welcome.

### Ordinary or Extraordinary?

The Water Bearer doesn’t mind new foods within reason. Realistically caffeine is the go-to food group for Aquarius. They may only drink coffee and forget to have something healthy. Slip a yogurt under their nose and suggest some decaf from time to time since stimulants aren’t really good for the Water Bearer’s system.

If you are having a small gathering keep it informal. Aquarians aren’t big on “black tie”, uptight settings. Dump Martha Stewart and grab a hippie for help here. As long as food tastes good the rest is superficial fluff.

### Aquarius in the Kitchen

The Water Bearer loves cutting edge recipes. Fusion foods? No problem! Whatever she makes, there will be a personal spin on it. Different than other signs, Aquarians enjoy cooking with others. Grab a cutting board and find a spot at the counter top! You are bound to get an education on everything from making glow in the dark doughnuts and dosha to garden-to-table eating trends, this is a night you won’t forget.

### Feeding your Aquarian

The Water Bearer can get caught up in their thoughts and just reach for junk food. Your job is intercepting that and replacing those noshes with something better. Have crunchy vegetables with light dip in the refrigerator along with home made granola. Start your Aquarians’ meal with rich French Onion soup (there are ways to make this vegetarian if you wish). The main event might be a tuna steak with wild rice & chestnuts. Dessert treats include lemon meringue tarts or a playful fondue.

Almonds

Ginger
Five-spice Blend
Black mustard seed
Anise
Mint

## Pisces: February 19 – March 20

Whenever food cooks on the stove, Pisces will put on some music. Typically upbeat and well-known, to the Fish food is a song in its own right.

Pisces is a very helpful friend and family member. He will want to pitch in even if that means taking out the trash or doing dishes. Don’t feel bad about asking for help – they’re just waiting for an invitation!
Generally watch your Pisces’ carb intake, and boy can they drink like a, well, fish! The Fish can use a good daily vitamin to offset their often odd eating habits.

### Pampering Pisces

One of the nicest things you can do for a Pisces is making them a thoughtful meal that includes good company. For the Fish, eating is a way of connecting on a deeper level. On date night by all means pull out the flowers and candles! Take your time with Pisces and experience a passion for food from their eyes.

### Pisces in the Kitchen

The Pisces kitchen isn’t always terribly organized, but she’ll still know where everything is. This chef enjoys creating an intuitive meal. Recipes? Nah. Just go to the cupboard, spice rack and freezer and grab out this-and-that. The amazingly magical result surprises not only guests but the Piscean too (they don’t always have great self esteem).

### Cooking for your Pisces

It may seem kind of contrary, but Fish like FISH! From bass and halibut to seaweed wrapped sashimi you simply can’t get Pisces out of the water. Stick with that general theme for your menu starting with lush Bouillabaisse. For a main dish try eggplant marinara over linguine. Keep it light for dessert with caramelized pears and figs with a sweet cream drizzle.
