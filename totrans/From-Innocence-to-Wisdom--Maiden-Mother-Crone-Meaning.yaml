    embodied the skills of healing, poetry, and witchcraft.

    Robert Graves, further explored the idea of a Triple Goddess worshiped across
    pre-Christian paganism in Europe and the ancient Middle East. This book served
    as an inspiration for the development of Wicca, which incorporated the concept
    of the **Triple Goddess** into its belief system. The Triple Goddess became firmly
    rooted in Wicca during the 1970s, with the Maiden, Mother, and Crone archetypes
    taking center stage in neopaganism.'
