Unnessicery. I was hoping this would be an article on things to consider before casting, but it's just made up jargon. Magick is intention, not colour. If you plan to do harm to another, please think before you cast. Negative energy lingers longer than positive, and even if you cast correctly if you don't remove this excess negative energy, it could cause negative effects to befall you.
