 At home before you go see the two enemies, take each necklace seperately, think of the enemies and say the following 1x:

"This necklace shall hold the power of love, bringing (enemy 1's name) and (enemy 2's name) together. Their love shall be unbreakable, for they will be together forever. If one attempts to pull them apart, that one shall be banished from the two lovers. The power invested in this necklace will help (Enemy 1's name) and (enemy 2's name) create a love chamber seal in them away from the rest of humanity for all eternity. They shall be bound together for forever more."

Now, give this necklace to each enemy seperately and later you will "hear the news".
