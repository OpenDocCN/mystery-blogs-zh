# Lovelorn Spell For Those Who Yearn - Learning Witchcraft

Avoid casting this spell with anyone particular in mind to avoid being accused of trying to control the person’s free will. Just place your trust on fate expecting that the person that answers to the spell is the perfect one for you. Cast the spell on a Friday that has a waxing moon (illumination is to the right) when the moon is waxing

**For the spell, you need:**

• Four green candles
• A cinnamon stick
• One pink candle
• A glass bowl filled with fresh spring water
• A bowl of earth
• White cord (9ft)
• A bottle of rose water
• Around twelve freshly plucked rose petals
• Rose Essential Oil
• Charcoal
• A small charcoal burner
• A gold pen

Take a warm shower or soak in a warm bath and afterward apply on yourself the rose water. The idea is to feel refreshed and adequately relaxed. Pick the white cord and place it down to form a circle and then light the green candles place one at each of the four primary compass points in the circle. After that, you can invoke the winds as you face each direction at a time (moving clockwise), uttering the following each for the respective direction you turn to face:

*I call unto thee North Wind,*
*I call unto thee East Wind,*
*I call unto thee West Wind,*
*I call unto thee South Wind,*
*I plea for love,  *
*and make this offering to you.*

Place the charcoal burner at the center of the circle, add and light the charcoal. Pick up and light the pink candle using the charcoal fire and put it beside the burner as you being to breathe deeply until your emotions and energies are concentrated.

Face the east and put seven rose petals on your right side and then apply the rose oil on the remaining petals. Crush the cinnamon stick and sprinkle it over the oiled petals and then you release them over the flaming charcoal.

Let your focus be on “LOVE” as you pick the gold pen to write that word on the seven rose petals on your right side. Proceed to float them down into the bowl of spring water. Sit at the center of the circle and allow the scent of the burning petals and cinnamon spice envelop you with every breath until all your energy and emotions are focused only on love.
At this point, give your yourself to the emotions as you open your heart and hand while repeating the following words seven times.

“Envelop me with love that I may feel a blissful heart to share with, from whom I shall not part.
Let him/her come to me of their volition and let it be so and of harm to no one.”

Once done, give thanks and extinguish the candles. End the spell by winding up white cord counter-clockwise and pick up the bowl of rose-scented spring water with both hands rising it up over your head and holding it in place for a moment before pouring it unto the earth.

Have faith after casting the spell that the one who answers the spell is the person who brings love into your life.
