  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we get to the description of a Wiccan wedding, let’s cover some terminology
    that could be useful. Remember, many of these terms are co-opted from old Celtic
    traditions, and so you may or may not want to use them. It is up to you.

- en: '### What is a Wiccan wedding called?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most Wiccans use the term ***handfasting*** in reference to the wedding ceremony.
    But handfasting is a traditional practice that can refer to many aspects of a
    wedding, so this isn’t clear on its own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It can be:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An ***unofficiated wedding*** where a couple marries without an officiant. This
    is usually done with the intention of having a second wedding with an officiant.

- en: A ***betrothal*** is an engagement or formal promise to wed which can be broken
    only through a divorce.

- en: The reason Wiccan weddings and handfasting ceremonies have so many possibilities
    is that the ceremony developed in pre-Christian Gaelic traditions before the state-sanctioned
    Christian form, which is more popular today.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In modern days, a Wiccan handfasting wedding is an adaptation of the ancient
    Celtic ceremony in which two lives are joined together through vows and the ceremonious
    binding of hands together with ribbons or cords. This is where the term ***tying
    the knot*** comes from.
  prefs: []

    or be secular. The choice is up to the participants.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wiccans believe in the concept of marriage, but they may approach it differently
    than some other belief systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wiccans generally believe in the idea of a sacred union between two people,
    and many Wiccans view marriage as a spiritual partnership as well as a social
    and legal contract.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wiccans may also place a strong emphasis on the idea of personal autonomy and
    the importance of both partners being able to maintain their own identities within
    the relationship. Wiccans may also view marriage as a way to celebrate their connection
    to the natural world and to the divine.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is a surprisingly common question. In the U.S., the answer is: of course
    Pagan weddings are legal. Marriage licenses are legal contracts given to all couples
    who complete the paperwork, regardless of the wedding, ceremony, or lack thereof.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Marriage laws vary state-to-state, but these laws only refer to things like
    the age of consent and how long one must wait to file the paperwork. The legal
    part of a marriage is separate from the wedding ceremony, and there is no requirement
    that a ceremony occurs at all.

    choice is yours. The officiant should be comfortable performing Wiccan magick.

    out when and where the next Sabbat will be held. If there is no coven in your
    area, try contacting your state’s [Pagan Pride](http://www.paganpride.org/) website

    white pillar candles arranged in a circle around you and your partner.

    of dried lavender–which are for your personal power/protection/blessing ritual
    that I will go over in detail later on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A coven usually has one person who acts as an “officiant” during rituals. This
    is usually an elder who knows what to do when things get started, so if you attend
    Sabbats often enough, ask the high priestess if she would be willing to officiate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from the coven or from one of the local Pagan groups stand in as the officiant.

    officiant does not need to be legally recognized. If this officiant is completing
    the legal part of the wedding, then you should make sure they’ve completed whatever
    certificate is required by your state ahead of time.
