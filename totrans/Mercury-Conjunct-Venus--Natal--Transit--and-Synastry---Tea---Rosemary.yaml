    The Mercury conjunct Venus aspect quite literally means *mental pleasure*, so
    it’s an aspect that many people appreciate!

- en: A conjunction means that two planets sit about 5 degrees or less (sometimes
    8 degrees or less, depending on the [type of software you use](https://iphemeris.com/))
    from each other. The energy of the two planets works together so it can be very
    hard to separate them. Typically, a conjunction is the strongest aspect in the
    natal chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mercury and Venus are both personal planets, so this conjunction will show up
    quite a bit in your everyday life. Mercury rules Gemini and Virgo; Venus rules
    Taurus and Libra. These signs are an interesting mix of air and earth elements
    together.
  prefs: []

    your natal chart than it will if this is a transiting aspect or an aspect in synastry.

- en: If you have the Mercury conjunct Venus aspect in your natal chart, you are charming,
    poetic, refined, and polite. This is a true “Libran” aspect that makes you intellectual
    yet warm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might have an appreciation for the arts with this aspect. I find that many
    of these natives enjoy painting, writing, screenplays, music, or any other form
    of art. Sometimes, they do this as a career, while other times it’s a hobby or
    outlet for self-expression.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have this aspect in your chart, you are extremely diplomatic but you
    still appear warm. You really have the perfect temperament to appeal to others.
    This is a natural gift bestowed in your birth chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oddly enough, you might come off as a bit *delicate* somehow. Even though Mercury
    conjunct Venus people are typically strong and are smart, cunning, and gregarious,
    they also have a delicate air that’s hard to explain. It endears people to you
    so it definitely isn’t a bad thing!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are attracted (romantically) to people who use their minds; intelligence
    is extremely interesting to you. You need to connect mentally on some level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also tend to attract these intellectual types *to* you. If there are other
    positive aspects (such as trines and sextiles) to the Mercury conjunct Venus aspect,
    then this will be a positive thing, but if there are squares, you may tend to
    attract conniving partners or those who are “too smart for their own good.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably value everyone’s opinions. You never think in black and white coloring;
    you’re willing to hear people out and give others the chance to speak or offer
    suggestions before you make a decision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This placement means that you tend to intellectualize or rationalize your feelings.
    Even though you love all things beautiful, it can be hard for you to really process
    your emotions on a deeper level than simply intellectual processing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have a talent for diplomacy with Mercury conjunct Venus. You choose your
    words carefully, often because you know what the other person wants to hear, but
    this can make people feel that you’re not genuine. If you *want* to lie, you’re
    probably pretty good at it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also be talented at writing, speaking, or other forms of communication,
    but this will depend mainly on the sign and the house the Mercury conjunct Venus
    aspect sits in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To others, you seem like you have good judgment, whether or not this is true.
    It’s typically easy for people to trust you, at least at first, because you come
    off as graceful and fair.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might be very creative and can sometimes use your ingenuity and intellectual
    graces to come up with new ways to earn money. Your tactfulness can help you exceed
    as a diplomat or political if you should choose that career path. These people
    are never rude and do extremely well around strangers!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, these folks can be great salespeople. They also excel in any
    forward people-facing position, but sometimes Mercury conjunct Venus folks appreciate
    the arts and would rather stay home and *create*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll find that this conjunction doesn’t necessarily dictate your life’s career
    path, but it can shed some light on the *qualities* that can assist you in achieving
    your dreams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In bed, you might especially enjoy verbal communication. You need to verbally
    know how your lover is feeling. Again, it can be hard for you to drop down into
    your feelings and let your mind go, so you need to find a way to bridge the gap.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As always, look at the sign and the house that the conjunction sits in. Mercury
    conjunct Venus in the 7th house will show up mainly in relationships, but this
    aspect in the 2nd house means that you can easily use this conjunct to acquire
    money and wealth.

    creative. If this seems like an oxymoron, don’t worry: I’ll explain it all!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    love, creativity, and all things beautiful. When there’s a Mercury conjunct Venus
    transit going on, we will all feel more creative in a way that’s productive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you might be able to come up with a new ideal that is the exact
    solution you’ve been seeking. Your creativity helped you to come up with the idea,
    not your intellect, but it is your enhanced logic that will put it into effect.

    been stuck on something for a while! You can expect to get brilliant ideas that
    simply aren’t natural for you.
  prefs: []

- en: When the Mercury conjunct Venus transit is happening, it’s a great time for
    socializing. Everyone will be more outgoing *and* more tactful. I find that this
    is a wonderful transit for large group events!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also a great time to negotiate any new deal or bargain. If you’re working
    on negotiating *anything*, wait until the Mercury conjunct Venus transit if possible.
    I know that you can’t always put off big matters until the astrology is right,
    but this is a *really* good transit for these types of deals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mercury conjunct Venus transit is also a great time to *close* deals. Most
    of the time, both parties feel very satisfied with what they get. For example,
    if you’re thinking of dissolving a business relationship with a business partner,
    the Mercury conjunct Venus transit would be the time to do it.
  prefs: []

    new relationships. Friendships blossom when they begin under this transit because
    everyone is tactful, polite, and charming.

    transit. First date conversations will be enjoyable, and the beauty of the other
    person will be enhanced to each individual’s date.
  prefs: []

    you probably *won’t* want to be sitting at home alone on this day. This is a great
    opportunity to get out and socialize.

    almost everyone can gain something during the Mercury conjunct Venus transit!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that the Mercury conjunct Venus synastry aspect is usually positive.
    It helps partners communicate in a way that is pleasant and logical. These people
    will generally have a fun time together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Often, the Mercury person in the Mercury conjunct Venus synastry aspect will
    do more of the talking, but this won’t create a power imbalance: it’s simply a
    personality difference.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus person will likely be charmed by the Mercury person. Although the
    Venus person might not listen on a deep level, and might care more about how the
    Mercury person’s words make them *feel*, they’re usually happy to be along for
    the ride.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If both people have good intentions, the Mercury conjunct Venus synastry aspect
    can be really beneficial! The couple is charmed by each other and generally enjoys
    each other’s company without trying too hard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If either party has some sort of ulterior motive, then this aspect can be a
    bit dangerous. It’s easy to deceive and charm with the Mercury conjunct Venus
    synastry aspect; this aspect makes it hard for either partner to see what the
    other is *truly* thinking. This is especially true if the aspect is in Pisces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of the sign, this aspect does make it easy for either partner to
    deceive the other. This may not cause a problem if neither partner has ulterior
    motives, but it can still hamper communication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, this aspect makes it hard for the Venus partner to *realize* when
    the Mercury partner is hurt (or has hurt feelings) and vice-versa. Even though
    this couple has a lovely, happy time together, they will need to work on improving
    communication in order to get to the root of issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, this aspect can make it difficult for the Venus person to tell
    the Mercury person what they really think about *anything*. The Venus person,
    depending on other aspects, may find themselves going along with everything because
    they don’t know how to say *no*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that the Mercury conjunct Venus synastry aspect is usually great at first
    and gets more difficult as the relationship progresses and the couple requires
    deeper communication. Traditional communication practice (and sometimes therapy)
    can help clear this up if both people are willing.
