## Pluto In The 10th House

In the natal chart, Pluto in the 10th house will impact you heavily in regards to your career and professional life.

This is a difficult planet to deal with. Pluto presents challenges and can even create traumatic experiences for the area of life that it’s placed in.

Pluto in the 10th house indicates many career challenges, but ultimately, this planet may force you to create a more authentic public image based on a job that truly suits you.

### Obsessions & Fear:

A person with Pluto in the 10th house may be obsessed with power. In many cases, this is due to fear of not having any power at all *or* not having a purpose in life. 

With this placement, you need to feel that you’re accomplishing something that matters. If your life feels purposeless then you may become overly obsessed with gaining power as a means to find a purpose.

It is important to be aware of the risk of abuse of power with this position, and/or becoming too attached to the career and the social status it brings. 

With Pluto in the 10th house, It is important to go back to your core values and the reasons you pursue success. Deep down, you probably want to make a positive contribution to society that actually means something. Pluto is nothing if not deep!

It is also important to learn how to use power in a healthy way.** You can become tyrannical and dictatorial with Pluto in the 10th house if you let the power go to your head. **

With great power comes great responsibility, but you might be tempted to use this power in an arrogant and selfish way. It’s possible to become overly dominant and controlling.

You may gain great influence in your community due to this placement, but it is important to use your influence for good. Pluto in the 10th house sets you up to have a lot of power, yet it’s up to you how you choose to use this power.

For example, Kim Kardashian has Pluto in the 10th house. Not only does she have really *public* sex appeal (in a Scorpionic, Plutonic way) but she has a great deal of power just by existing. She can singlehandedly set worldwide trends with the flick of a wrist.

Other key celebrity examples include Eminem, someone who is a trendsetter in a massive way in the rap industry, and Vladimir Putin, someone who holds a lot of political power and whose actions send a ripple effect across the world.

As you can see, Pluto in the 10th house won’t tell you how to use your power, especially the power that comes to you naturally. It *does* indicate that you’re like to get obsessed with the idea of power, however that may play out in your chart. It also indicates that you *fear* not having any power.

With Pluto in the 10th house, it’s important to deal with your issues relating to your fear before you can truly be successful in the way that you desire.

### Control & Desire:

In spite of your desire for success, you seem to need to work harder than most people. You have a certain amount of natural power but it never gets you *quite* where you need to go. This is how your desire for power can quickly turn into an obsession.

When your Pluto in the tenth house is negatively impacted, this becomes more emphasized.

You have trouble waiting for things to play out, preferring to use force to *make* something happen, though this rarely works out well for you.

The placement can also occur if the parent works as a researcher, psychologist, or has a Pluto-related job. Sometimes, Pluto in the 10th house indicates that your parent had a certain amount of sex-appeal (in a Plutonic way) or even that they remade their own image. The very things that apply to you with Pluto in the 10th house could also apply to the way that you perceived your parent.

However, you also *attract* authority figures who want to overpower you, forcing you to give up all the public control you so desperately need.

There is no giving up for you with Pluto in the 10th house. If you want something, you’ll see it through until you achieve your desires.

There may be a love-hate reaction to your personal presence, especially among your professional colleagues. Yet you can easily be convincing in certain situations. You have that Scorpionic energy that can easily put others into a trance. This can be extremely powerful, for good or bad, once you learn how to channel this energy.

### Transformation:

Your career path may undergo ups and downs as a result of this placement.Pluto is known for taking things from you abruptly, forcing you to transform, and this planet acts no differently in the 10th house.

Many people with this placement find that their career transforms over time in ways they never thought possible. If you notice this happening, pay close attention to your public image, since this is probably shifting, too.

While these big shifts can be difficult, remember that old structures must be torn down to make room for new ones. After you’ve dealt with the fallout, Pluto in the 10th house gives you the power to go back to where you were or to climb even higher than before.

Some people with this placement choose to change careers, changing from one field to another, as Pluto works its transformation magic. Luckily, with Pluto in the 10th house, you aren’t one to easily give up. Keep trying and you’re sure to find where you fit. 

Pluto’s healing power allows you to be able to work in a healing field once you’ve resolved your issues. Regardless of the specific field that you work in, you’ll most likely use your power for good (again, the example of Harry Potter). While this is of course your personal choice, you’ll find that it’s easier to flow *with* Pluto than to push against the energy of this planet.

Ultimately, Pluto in the 10th house will force you (through a lot of painful lessons that you have no control over) to see that your image isn’t what you thought. It will push you to work for yourself and for others instead of for power and control. You can resist Pluto, but you’ll find that life is much easier if you flow *with* the energy.

Pluto here will also teach you how to use the power that you have *inside* of yourself instead of looking for that power in the outside world. Everything you need is already within you. This is why you don’t need to rely on authority figures; as you’ll find with Pluto, you are your *own* authority.
