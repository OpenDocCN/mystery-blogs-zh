    necromancy, although originally she was the goddess of the wilds, the moon, and
    childbirth. Her Roman counterpart is Trivia. Learn more about Hecate in this lesson:

- en: Hecate is the Divinity of the Underworld who is called the Queen of the night
    and Goddess of the crossroads. Her three faces turn in all possible directions,
    and she is often seen with torches.

- en: Some believe that Hecate grants wealth and success to those whose prayers she
    receives favorably. In the same way, the result of war and victory in games may
    depend on her, who grants glory to whomever she pleases. This power resembles
    that of Witchcraft, as Medea – a powerful priestess of Hecate – used to handle
    magical herbs and poisons with this skill.
