 ## Casting Instructions for 'Bones of Anger Revenge Hex'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Chicken bones

*   Hammer

*   Besom/broom and dust pan (preferably one used only for magic)

*   Cloth bag

*   Bell

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Chicken bones

*   Hammer

*   Besom/broom and dust pan (preferably one used only for magic)

*   Cloth bag

*   Bell

 Gather bones of chickens and dry them in the sun for a few
days. Then when you are ready to do this hex make sure you
are worked up into a frenzy of anger and hatred. This will
add to the potency of your hex! Be thinking of all this
while doing this hex and when it says "**With these bones I
now do crush**," take a hammer or use your feet to stomp and
crush these bones as if they were your enemy before you!

When you are done sweep, them up and place them in a bag. You
will then want to sprinkle the dust and remains of the bones
on your enemy's property around his house.

If you have a bell ring it 3 times and say...

**"I call upon the Ancient Ones from the great abyss to do my
bidding I invoke Cuthalu, God of Anger and the creatures of
the underworld hear me now."

"Bones of anger, bones to dust
full of fury, revenge is just
I scatter these bones, these bones of rage
take thine enemy, bring him pain
I see thine enemy before me now
I bind him, crush him, bring him down
With these bones I now do crush
Make thine enemy turn to dust
torment, fire, out of control
With this hex I curse your soul
So mote it be!'**
