    a day-to-day basis and treat each and every event as a learning experience. Short-term
    flexibility is the key to long-term success, so be ready to adapt at a moment’s
    notice.

- en: Your emotions are a bit close to the surface at the moment and that could spell
    trouble if you overreact to something of no real significance. Stay calm and don’t
    let anything get to you. Isn’t Aquarius supposed to be a dispassionate sign?

- en: Why are you now having doubts about something that only a short time ago you
    had huge enthusiasm for? Whatever the reason you need to get over it soon because
    it’s too late to turn back. Go all the way and make a success of it.

- en: Always remember that you are the one who is calling the shots. The Sun in your
    sign magnifies your aura of power, making it easy for you to get others to do
    things for you. So long as your motives are good you can do as you please.

- en: Keep your thoughts to yourself over the next 24 hours, because the less others
    know about your plans the better. The Sun in Aries at this time of year tends
    to make you somewhat reticent anyway, so being secretive should be no great hardship.

- en: If someone lets you down today or tomorrow you will act as if you are disappointed
    but chances are you will be secretly delighted. If you find you have more time
    on your hands than you expected use it to broaden you mind in some way.

    aiming for, so make sure you are clear in your mind what your ultimate goal is
    before you start going after it. The thought comes first, the deed comes later.

    more you can make positive thoughts your focus the more likely it is you will
    succeed – so stop worrying and get on with your life. Your thoughts make your
    world.

    close your ears and attempt to ignore them. Not only have they got your best interests
    at heart but in all probability they know what they are talking about.

    you should think twice before giving anyone the benefit of the doubt today. Also,
    be careful what promises you make, as they could cost you dear in the long-term.

    feet up and let others do the fetching and carrying for a while. Give both your
    mind and your body time to recover before the next round of tasks begins.

    even so it won’t by itself be enough. Be smart over the next 24 hours and get
    assistance from people who have expert knowledge in the areas where you are lacking.

    will be free and easy with your affections, but try not to clam up completely
    and make it look like you have no feelings at all. Be pragmatic, but be pragmatic
    with heart.
