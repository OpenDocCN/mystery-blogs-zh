*   3 candles (any type of color)

*   Loud voice

## Casting Instructions for 'Multi-Candle Lychnomancy Divination'

Multi-Candle Lychnomancy Divination

STEP 1: Set up your altar, cleanse and cast your circle.

STEP 2: Set up 3 candles of any color on your altar in a tight triangle.

STEP 3: Sit calmly with your eyes closed for a few minutes... and ask your most important question of the Goddess.

Ask your question out loud. It could be a big problem you need guidance with... or your biggest desire that you'd like to attract to your life...

For example, I'll be asking, ''My husband and I had a disagreement over the past week. Please show me what's to come, and how I can remove any lingering negative energies...''

STEP 4: After thinking about your question for a few minutes... open your eyes and stare at the candles. Try to focus on a point about 6 inches BEHIND the candles.

This will allow you to interpret the flames better.

STEP 5: You'll see the flames begin to move.

Here's how to interpret the movements:

- If one flame starts burning higher than the others, this is an sign of a very good outcome to your question. You won't need to do much Magickally to get the result you desire...

- If one candle abruptly goes out before the others, it's going to be difficult for you regarding your question. And you must work on some spells to improve the situation.

I recommend picking through some of the spells I've sent you in the past...and pick out a few that match up with your question and desires.

- If the flames rise and fall consistently, this means CAUTION. Things are probably not going to go smoothly if you don't cast some well placed spells regarding your question.

While this isn't as urgent as a flame going out (above), treat it in the same way by doing some well placed spell work.

- Back and forth flame movements indicate the situation surrounding your question is about to change rapidly... and I recommend you wait to see what changes come, and then see what you need to do Magickally (if anything) at that time.

- If the flames move in spirals, beware of hidden problems and pitfalls regarding the situation around your question. I recommend doing some more divinations and scrying to reveal these hidden problems before you do anything else.

- If the flames do nothing but flicker occasionally, you can be very positive about the outcome of your question, and everything will work out in your best interests... just sit back and enjoy life in the coming weeks, and see things improve in your life.
