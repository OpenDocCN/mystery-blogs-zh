    \ hexes you become aware of being sent in your direction. Anger from others can\
    \ often be dealt with in this way, but deliberate maliciousness may require more\
    \ force. You need to be as dispassionate as you can when dealing with a hex, which\
    \ is defined as \x91an evil spell\x92."
