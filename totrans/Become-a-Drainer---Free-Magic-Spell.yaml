    being aware of the proper side effects or the rules, and so on.

    With a candle, many who do not use a candle, it doesn't work for them.

    that makes you hyper, or energy to move, or energy that surrounds a supernatural's
    body that depends on one's abilities, it may be energy that involves the emotions

    One, if you are part or full enhancer, this is why. Because your eyes are enhances
    and do not adjust well to the sunrays. two, you may have light colored eyes, like
    blue, grey or green eyes are more sensitive to the sunlight than others.
  prefs: []

    change fully. However, we often see people who just think they see their eye change
    color, or mistaken the color changing due to lights like flashlights, or flasing
    lights off of a camera. Often, people mistake their pupils getting bigger to their
    eyes changing to black. This is often not the case.

    nausea, dizzyness, lightheaded ness, etc. Often, this is due to not recieving
    a form of energy for a certain amount of time. the stronger the drainer, the longer
    they can last without a energy source. However, they can live without energy,
    they will NOT die from it.

    You may feel energized, or your abilities may be boosted. However, if youre abilities
    are boosted by blood, this doesn't mean you are a drainer, since certain type
    of supernatural blood boost any supernatural's abilities.

    drainers have this sign as well.

    - **fact and myth** Real vampires, or drainers, do not need blood. They can survive
    off of it, however, some may feel sick without it. This can be headaches, nausea,
    dizzyness, lightheadedness, etc. However, they do not just need some form of energy.

    be sensitive to the sunlight worse than normal. However, blue, green and grey
    eyes are more sensitive to sunlight anyway.

- en: Real vampires kill people or animals for food or for blood. - **myth** Unless
    they literally are a murderer,then no. That is like saying humans kill people
    for food. Yes, that happens, but its NOT COMMON, and NOT ALL HUMANS do it. So,
    this is also beyond stupid in my opinion.

- en: Real vampires have fangs - **myth** The truth is, blood vampires tend to have
    sharper teeth in the 'fangs' area but they don't suddenly grow out of no where.
    These are normal teeth, and in theory, they are not as sharp due to past generations
    who may have used their teeth to take blood a lot because drainers tend to like
    biting. But we have tools, and no how to NOT get infection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vampires don't get sick, or cant get an infection when they drink blood. - **Myth**
    This is dumb as well. I think we are forgetting what a vampire/drainer really
    is. A vampire is a supernatural, meaning, they are HUMANS with supernatural abilities.
    Some tend to fit in 'groups' that title themselves or their 'kinds'. They are
    still human, they can still get sick.

    vampires are humans. They need sleep to survive, just like everyone does. And
    they don't sleep in coffins unless they choose to, but just like most humans don't
    sleep in coffins, most vampires don't either.

    not been shown possible.
