    your life for better or worse. Chiron in Aquarius is all about feeling different.
    This wound can show itself in a lot of different ways.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have Chiron in Aquarius, you feel *different* in groups, but this will
    manifest in one of two ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the first way, you go out of your way to get a reaction *about* your differences.
    You come off as ultra-eccentric.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is the differences that you have that you play up around others, but not
    necessarily in a positive way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might come off as weird or odd because you’re forcing these differences
    rather than showing them in an authentic way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might also react strongly to any perceived slight. You do this to break
    bonds that might be forming before the other people can break them or judge you
    because that would be too painful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, with Chiron in Aquarius, you might remain friendly but distant.
    You never really feel comfortable in a group so you’re scared to open up and show
    your true self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might be hard for others to really grasp who you are because you avoid becoming
    truly close.
  prefs: []

- en: I find that the Chiron in Aquarius person can sometimes (depending on the house)
    get obsessed with social *causes* as a way of feeling connected to society, however
    this might backfire because the individual *really* wants to belong in a group,
    not just to the idea of a cause.

    who are Starseeds.

    an outside, and that is because you quite literally hail from another planet.
  prefs: []

    You might not have known how to act and how to fit in among the rules and society
    on Earth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that this wound usually *did* begin with real differences, but when you
    were hurt by groups noticing these differences, your feelings compounded and over
    time created a deep, painful wound.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, the wound might be triggered even if you technically do fit in because
    the wound is *inside* you.
