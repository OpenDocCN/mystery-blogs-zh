    let them see. Sands of the east, rich soils beneath Three times three, set them
    free, set them free. Fires in the south, awaken from sleep Three times three,
    let them see, let them see. Water of the west, flow to the seas Three times three,
    set them free, set them free."    It works best if you have something representing
    that person, like a strand of their hair or a fingernail. The spell may not work
    instantaneously, you may have to repeat it for the person to see error in their
    ways.'
