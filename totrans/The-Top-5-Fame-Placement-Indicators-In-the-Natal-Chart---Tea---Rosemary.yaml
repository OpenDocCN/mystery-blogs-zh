- en: The top questions I get when I’m reading someone’s birth chart are about love,
    marriage, money, and fame. This is always pretty surprising to me. I completely
    understand the first 3 topics, but fame is always a funny one to get when percentage
    wise, so few people will be famous in this world.

- en: We all picture blockbuster movie stars, but fame in the birth chart can refer
    to so many things. You can find internet fame, scandal fame, and even negative
    fame as a criminal or other adverse position in the birth chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of the *type* of fame, there are a few main placements that indicate
    fame. More of these of course mean that you’re more likely to get that fame, but
    you’ll need to look at the birth chart as a whole to see a clear picture.

    chart, so this house is always the first place I look when I’m reading a chart
    for fame.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The signs that tend to create the most public fame in this chart are Scorpio,
    Leo, and Aquarius. Each has a different type of fame; Scorpio is more expressive,
    Aquarius is humanitarian, and Leo is just straight up famous (sometimes for almost
    no reason).

    degrees. Generally, this means that the planet and sign are emphasized further.
    I could go into this a *lot* more, but for our purposes here, just keep in mind
    that these degrees are important in fame astrology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I tend to look for these degrees in any planet in Leo, in the 1st house, or
    in the 10th house. Leo is quite literally the sign of fame, while the first house
    shows the outer self and the 10th house shows the public image.

    and groups. This can represent large group followings or even cult followings,
    whether in a positive or negative way.
  prefs: []

    You’ll need to evaluate aspects and the rest of your chart to see what fits.

    will be the same as the 10th house (see above).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The 10th and 11th houses can independently signal fame, but a conjunction between
    the two houses can be an indicator of a life in the spotlight as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, let’s pretend you have Mars in the 10th house and Uranus in the
    11th house, and they’re within 5 degrees in the same sign. These planets are conjunct.
    This can sometimes point to fame, because the 10th house is your public image
    but the 11th house is your friend group or fanbase. If both of these planets have
    fame aspects *and* are conjunct, the odds of fame are pretty good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is especially true if the planets are in a sign that can signal fame, although
    notoriety is possible with any sign. Leo is the most classic sign for straight
    up fame, but less obvious signs (such as Libra or Cancer) can indicate fame stardom
    for different reasons.

- en: The 5th house is the house of Leo. It’s most well-known for it’s indications
    about children, but the 5th house also has to do with fame, theater, and anything
    related to the spotlight.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I often find a lot of prominent 5th house placements in charts of people who
    are on Broadway or find fame in some sort of live performance way. Be aware that
    the 5th house can also bring more ego than other placements, depending on the
    planet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look to the planet and sign to see how the fame might manifest. For example,
    prominent Mercury placements might have to do with poetry or science (due to the
    mind), while Jupiter may have to do with beliefs, spirituality, or religious fame.

    Leo is simply *the* sign of fame. A celebrity with a lot of Leo placements will
    often be famous for almost no reason; people with lots of Leo have a magnetic
    quality that just can’t be explained. They draw others to them and often have
    a natural birthright to the spotlight.

    all. I will put down a few here, but remember that the more Leo placements you
    find, the more likelihood there is for fame to exist in the chart.
