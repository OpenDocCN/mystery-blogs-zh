Teens often find themselves attracted to Witchcraft. The reasons vary. Some find it mysterious and somewhat of a curiosity. Others see it as a way to find personal power when everything in life feels dictated. Others still may know Witches and like what they see. Eventually, some of those people choose Witchcraft as a spiritual path.

## What is it Like to be a Teen Witch?

Realistically being a Teen Witch is no different than being a Witch of any other variety. At some point, you felt that something was missing in your life. When you read about Wicca or other types of Wise Craft, there was a sense of belonging. Many people say that when they became a Witch, they feel like they finally have a name for those innermost beliefs and world-views.

This sense of belonging is critical during the teen years. As young adults, 101 emotions are rattling in their heads. Everyone around the Teen Witch has an opinion of how they should live their life and openly expresses just that. This is because “adults” often perceive all teens as immature. This is simply a broad brush view. Age is nowhere as important as wisdom and responsibility in Witchcraft.

## Letting Your Circle Know You’re a Witch: The Friends and Family Plan

One of the hardest struggles for Teen Witches is expressing their new beliefs to friends and family who may be anything BUT receptive. Unfortunately, you say the “W” word and some people immediately jump to outmoded images of Witchery. Explaining that difference isn’t easy even for people who have walked a magical path for decades.

Friends may be more accepting than parental units. A good friend doesn’t judge but asks a lot of questions. The Teen Witch must be ready to answer those questions honestly. That means studying the basics of Witchcraft, especially the parts that appealed to them in the first place.

Parents are a whole different ball of twine. Some parents may have strict religious ideas that don’t include having a Witch under their roof. The phrase “their house, their rules” come to mind. This is where the young adult pauses and decides whether or not to stay in the broom closet.

## Teen Witch in Hiding: When To Keep Silent

Some Teen Witches choose to stay silent about their beliefs and practices. In some cases, it’s because they know their parents would immediately shut down the conversation. In other instances, there is a question of hurt feelings. Both reasons deserve respect from other magical practitioners. Please, dear reader, do not “out” your witchy friends. It can prove very painful and harm relationships.

For example, let’s say that Grandma Sadie wants the Teen Witch to go to church with her. She doesn’t know about the whole witchcraft scene, and the Witch wonders if going to church is hypocritical. This is probably not the best time for her, or anyone else, to blurt out a proclamation of her newfound faith.

So what does the Teen Witch do? She considers what Witchcraft stresses regarding love and respect toward our Elders. She and Grandma go to church and enjoy being together (she does not burst into flames). That fellowship is precious as Grandma won’t be here forever. As for being in a church, The Teen witch realizes that the God and Goddess are everywhere. You just have to look.

## The “Talk” with Parents about Witchcraft

No, not the birds and the bees (smile). Choosing to share this new adventure with one’s parents needs to be a well-considered moment. The Teen Witch needs to stress that this isn’t just a whim, and explain why this is important. The best advice often given for this situation is to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Some Teen Witches have amazing parents that support personal choice. Some do not.

It’s frustrating for young adults practicing Witchcraft when they find the home front intolerant and unmovable. The truth is that house rules matter. No Witch “needs” candles, books, pentacles and sacred stones for visualization, meditation, affirmations or even spells for that matter. The key to survival for Teen Witches is knowing, deep down, that being a Witch isn’t something you do, but rather something you are. That doesn’t change just because they cannot discuss the matter right now with their parents.

The good news is that after their teen years many witches find acceptance at home. The parents see commitment and persistence. Some have taken the time to research the matter. This either changes their mind about Wicca or minimally makes them less worried.

## How do I Become a Teen Witch?

Because of your age group, it may be hard to find a coven with whom you can interact. Just finding other serious Witches is difficult (it’s not like they’re listed in the Yellow Pages). This means Teen Witches often become Solitary Practitioners who create their own magical lesson plan.

First things first: get to know the basic guidelines of the Craft and think about what kind of Witch you want to be. Truthfully if you stick to the concept of “do no harm” you can’t go terribly wrong. As for finding a specific magical tradition, that will take some thought.

Perhaps you have a fondness for a specific culture. That’s a good place to start looking. That’s how Celtic Witches got their feet wet. Alternatively, you may feel a strong affinity with Nature. Then you can consider the idea of being a Green Witch or Herb Witch, for example.

By the way, it’s ok to start down a path and realize it is not going the way you imagined. This happens to a lot of people throughout their lives. When you’re faced with that reality, it’s time to go back to square one. What do you want out of Witchcraft and what does it mean to you? Then begin looking at an alternative magical tradition. Or perhaps consider Eclectic Wicca, which offers a lot of creativity, as an option.

**Word of caution:** If anyone tells you that you must pay for a class or personal instructions check out their credentials. Magical instruction takes time and energy, so small fees are understandable. But high fees or claims of 100% results should raise a red flag immediately.

Best wishes on your journey.
