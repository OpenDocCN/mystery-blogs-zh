- en: Today’s world is very stressful, and fortunately many people turn to alcohol
    or some other crutch to help them cope with all of the pressures of modern life.
    Needless to say, willpower is the key to allowing us to reduce our reliance on
    these things. However, willpower needs a bit of extra help at times. The spell
    might be just what people need who know that they have a problem with abusing
    alcohol. Recovering alcoholics should never cast this spell if one sip of alcohol
    could potentially reverse the progress that they have made already. The spell
    may also be cast to assist others with overcoming their dependence. The spell
    should be cast outdoors in a sheltered area where candles can burn without any
    danger of being blow out by the breeze.

    that you can sit inside of it. Sit cross-legged and face the orange candle, with
    the red one to your left and behind you, and the purple one to your right and
    behind you. Place the wine in between the orange candle and wine, with the crystal
    next to it. Before lighting the candles, first take several deep breaths through
    your nose,and then hold to a count of seven before you breath out of your mouth.
    As you are inhaling and exhaling, visualize the crystal getting empowered from
    your will power. Once you are ready, light your candles, and then pick up and
    crystal and hold it tightly, while saying the following:'
