- en: Today is the first day of the year - and the first day of a new decade. What
    better way to start off the year than with a tarot reading?! For this reading,
    I decided to do a general reading for how 2020 is going to go for the majority
    of the population. This is what we can expect for each month around the world
    in one form or another.

    me. Sometimes I think reading the collective can be difficult. However, you will
    never know unless you try. I also plan on doing this reading for myself personally,
    and I will use the same spread. I understand this reading a bit, but I would love
    to hear what you think about it after you read it.

    interested, you can find it [here](http://www.roundthecauldron.com/new-year-tarot-spread-free-printable/)
    and I will include an image here as well. I also used my Wild Unknown deck, which
    is one of my favorites. The difference here is that the court cards are Daughter,
    Son, Mother, and Father instead of Page, Knight, Queen, and King.

    theme for that particular month. If you choose to do this reading for yourself,
    feel free to draw as many cards as you want for each month. Whatever helps you
    and works for you. Then there is a card for the overall theme of 2020 as well
    as a card of the year’s goals and obstacles.

- en: So, for 2020, this is my interpretation. I don’t want to call it a prediction
    because - if you believe as I do - **not everything is set in stone** and our
    fate is not always sealed. However, I know that sometimes the Gods have Their
    ideas for what they want to happen. They may go to great lengths to accomplish
    Their goals.

- en: We start off the year **strong**. The energy of the Father of Wands allows us
    to carry purposeful and meaningful actions into the new year. With this new action
    and inspiration brought to 2020 by the Father of Wands, the Page of Swords kindles
    that creativity and thirst for knowledge. By March, something emotional will happen
    - in a good way - that will affect a lot of people. There could be a mass spiritual
    awakening as is reflected by the overflowing of the chalices and their connection
    with the element of water and emotion. In April, we will be met with a strong
    leader who understands that structure is important, but sometimes things need
    to change to allow for growth. Where this leader will come from, I don’t know.
    However, they will be apparent to those who are spiritually aware.

    new happiness. Partnerships will develop and relationships will move forward,
    allowing for progress. The Sun in June allows the happiness and joy to continue
    to flow. At this halfway point through the year, we can relish in the warmth of
    the sun - literally and figuratively - and have the fun in our lives that we so
    deserve.

- en: '**July is more foreboding** with the 4 of Swords following the frivolity. Typically
    representative of a time of rest and meditation, it worries me that this follows
    the happiness of May and June. Do we overwork ourselves in those months? Does
    the energy dwindle down? What has caused us to put a pause on the happiness and
    look inward? This is especially daunting with the August card being that of the
    5 of Pentacles. Typically representing loss and poverty, I am drawn to think that
    the frivolity of the previous months throughout the world causes some sort of
    crash - either the housing bubble, the stock market, or the like. However, we
    draw on our strength - both inner and outer - in the coming month as shown by
    the mighty lion of the Strength card.'

    though we relied on our strength in the previous month, we were not meant to keep
    the thing that we lose. There could be a crisis or a betrayal, and most people
    will feel this sense of loss.

    The World shows us that this cycle - although painful at times - is now complete.
    We have learned as a whole what we need to know to move forward and embrace the
    knowing of the Mother of Swords in December. The Mother of Swords faces the future
    with both her stern demeanor and soft understanding. This leads me to believe
    that a woman will come to be important during the end of 2020 - in whichever way
    it is meant to pass.'

    are heavily associated with the element of fire and the ideas of passion, creativity,
    and creation. The 7 of Wands represents a challenge that the world will face -
    and that the entire purpose of this year is to be challenging and allow us to
    pull together as a whole and embrace the truth of the situation. We are armed
    with what we need - **though we may not know it yet** - and we must persevere
    through the obstacles to come out on top.'

- en: '**The goal of 2020** is represented by the 5 of Cups, a card of emotion. We
    know by the previous card that **2020 is going to be challenging**, and it appears
    that the goal of 2020 is for some sort of a disappointment to take place to allow
    for spiritual growth as a collective. There are those among us who need to feel
    the disappointment and failure before they can move forward.'

- en: However, the obstacles facing this goal of 2020 is represented by The Magician.
    **The Magician is a person who is fully connected to all realms** - mental, physical,
    and spiritual. This person - or people - could show up to help prevent the disappointment
    and failure of those around them that could be caused by this coming year. The
    Magician is a master of their tools and - being connected to the divine in some
    way - may not be an obstacle in the way we think. This obstacle could be placed
    here to allow for the spiritually connected to come to the light and save the
    day, so to speak. Without the Magician, disappointment and failure could be catastrophic.

    could be representative of specific events? **Yes, I do.** Part of me hopes that
    a certain someone in a political position is taken care of - which would happen
    in November - and then a new person would come in and take over - which would
    happen in December. However, that is me putting my own political spin on the reading.

- en: I would also like to point out how this plays in with the numerology of the
    year. As we know from a previous post, the year 2020 has a Year Number 4\. A Universal
    Year 4 year is all about getting things done. The energy of the number 4 in numerology
    helps to calm us down so we can buckle up and go along for the ride. It is a year
    of accomplishment for many people but, as we know, chasing your dreams and accomplishing
    your goals is sometimes fraught with failure and disappointment. So, it is interesting
    to me - and a form of confirmation - that my reading for the year as it applies
    to the collective corresponds with the numerology of the year.
