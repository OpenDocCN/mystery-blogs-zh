Lisa takes the amethyst from her bowl of moon water. The protection charm is complete.

 She grabs her keys and starts to head out the door, but stops for a moment.

 She wonders where she should put the charm. The modern world can be so unforgiving for those practicing ancient traditions.

 Lisa takes a small, white velvet pouch and sets the charm in it. She sees her leftover dried angelica and realizes she can put several protection elements into the pouch.

 She infuses it with energy, and the inconspicuous charm bag pouch enhances the protection of the charms.

She can take it anywhere without arousing suspicion.

 ## What is a Charm Bag?

You may be asking yourself: **what is a magic charm bag?**

Charm bags, also called **charm pouches**, are small bags filled with charms or items infused with magickal energy: all with a specific focused intent. They let you carry magickal items with you wherever you go.

 They are one of the most personalizable forms of magic. You can put in one item or a dozen. They can be scented or not. They can be large or small.

 Once you get the hang of making a charm bag, the possibilities are endless.

One of the most interesting parts is that you can take what appears to be a small purse and turn it into a charm bag and no one would know!

### Ingredients

There are really only two essential ingredients: the bag and at least one charm.

 Everything else is going to be up to personal taste.

You’ll want to familiarize yourself with common [symbolism in Wicca](https://craftofwicca.com/wiccan-symbols-and-meanings-general-and-specific/) if you’re not already familiar.

Every choice you make for the ingredients has the opportunity to enhance how well it works.

 The type of fabric and color of the fabric can enhance it. For example, you could use white or green for a protection charm bag. You could use red for a love charm bag.

The small pouches above are my current favorite, and you can [get them here](https://amzn.to/2HZfQJR).

 The charm itself will probably come from a different spell. You can put multiple charms in the bag, too. Don’t worry about that. They could all be gems or none could be gems.

 You can add herbs or scents that align with the purpose of the bag.

 My personal favorite combination is to use one gemstone charm as the base, then add to the bag one herb, and one hand-drawn rune symbol.

This three-piece combination synergizes great in my own craft. Experiment with your own ingredients to see what works for you.

 ## How to Make a Charm Bag

Once you’ve settled on the ingredients of the charm bag, it’s time to make it.

Again, I want to reiterate that you shouldn’t get too hung up on this. You don’t need an exact formula given by someone else. Use whatever you have on hand or go out and buy all the ingredients new. Follow a recipe or make substitutions or make up your own.

It’s up to you!

 The creation of the charm bag works the same exact way as making a charm.

 1.  Gather all the materials together.
2.  Now make sure your space is clear of negative energy and that you can completely focus on the task.
3.  Generate personal energy and visualize the charm bag working (check out my [beginner article](https://craftofwicca.com/elemental-magic-for-beginners/) on elemental magic if you need tips on this).
4.  Place each item in the charm bag and release the energy into it. You can focus the energy by saying words designed for that purpose, but you don’t have to.
5.  It’s done!

Remember, <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">the</g> clearer and more specific your visualization, the better you’ll be able to channel the energy with the right intent. You could also start with a [Wiccan meditation](https://craftofwicca.com/how-to-start-a-daily-wiccan-meditation/) to enhance the effect.

 As with everything, you can experiment to find stronger spells that work for you. You could integrate elemental techniques into the charming process with incense or candles or music.

You can head out to do a water ritual by a pond before crafting your divination charm bag.

 The possibilities are endless, and the more you make it your own, the more success you’ll have.

 ## How to Make a Protection Charm Bag

This is my standard charm bag for protection, a **protection spell bag** if you will. Carry it with you to be protected from harmful energies.

 Ingredients:

 *   Protection charm
*   White pouch
*   Angelica
*   Paper
*   Pen

### 1\. Make the protection charm that most suits your purpose.

You don’t even need to charm it first. You could just use a gem that represents the type of protection you want.

 If you’re stuck, a good general purpose crystal for this is black tourmaline:

(You can [get it cheap](https://amzn.to/2I1ILNn) here.)

### 2\. Draw the following rune on the piece of paper.

Wrap the paper around the stone or charm and visualize the type of protection you want.

 Make sure to use very specific images that resonate the concept of protection to you.

This could be blocking negative psychic energy. It could be physical protection. Presumably, you already have something in mind if you want to make this.

 ### 3\. Generate personal energy inside you.

Feel it build up as you continue your visualization. Once it hits a critical amount, start to release it into the ingredients as you place them into the bag.

 ### 4\. Focus the channeled energy with an incantation.

As you release the energy and put the items into the charm bag, say the words:

*I make this bag for protection
By preparing the ingredients with affection
Take my energy <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">in</g> this time
Return it back: a life sublime*

The charm bag for protection is complete.

 ## Charm Bag for Love

This is my standard charm bag for love. Carry it with you to attract love into your life.

Ingredients:

*   Love charm
*   Red Pouch
*   Cinnamon stick
*   Paper
*   Pen

Make the love charm in my [article on Fire Magic](https://craftofwicca.com/fire-spells-elemental-magic/).

 Draw the following love rune on the piece of paper:

 The paper can be small. It will need to fit into the pouch.

Now visualize what love means to you. It can be romantic or sisterly. The type of energy you focus now will affect what will return to you.

Be very clear and certain with the intention. Wrap the love charm in the paper and set it in the pouch.

 Say the words:

 *Charm bag for love:
I place this gem.
Goddess energy above
Grant your power to them.*

Continue to place each ingredient into the bag and feel the energy flow out of you and into the charm bag. Take as much time as you need.

 It is now complete.

## More Variations

Consider all the things you can do to enhance your bag. The time of day might matter. I’d do the love bag <g class="gr_ gr_14 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="14" data-gr-id="14">at</g> noon in summer.

I would make a divination charm bag under the full moon at midnight.

 The cycles of life affect everything, and the more thought and effort you put into the crafting of your charm bags, the more they will return to you.

Good luck, and enjoy the experience!
