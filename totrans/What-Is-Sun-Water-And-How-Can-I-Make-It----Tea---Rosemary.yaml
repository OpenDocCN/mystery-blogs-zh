- en: Moon water is super popular these days, but I like making sun water equally
    as much! While it isn’t as well-known, I feel that it’s extremely powerful in
    its own right.

- en: Moon water is infused with the energy of the moon, so sun water is (of course)
    infused with the energy of the sun.

- en: Sun water and moon water have different properties. If you’ve studied astrology
    at all, then you know that the sun is your outer self, your ego, and your personal
    light. The moon is your inner emotional self and unconscious self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sun represents fire and stability while the moon represents water and emotions.
    They’re both useful but have their own purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When choosing between moon water and sun water, you’ll want to consider what
    you’re using it for and what type of properties you need to accomplish your goal.

- en: Fill the jar (or bowl or glass) with water and set it on a windowsill. All you
    need to do is set the intention that the water will be infused with the power
    of the sun by simply thinking it.

    then by all means do so! Whatever feels right is right. For me, just thinking
    the intention makes powerful spell water.

- en: I like to let my water sit in the full sun for at least 3 hours, but if you
    don’t have the time, it will be charged after even 15 minutes (and I have personally
    felt the effects of this).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can most quickly create strong sun water by placing your glass or jar directly
    in the sunlight, but if it’s winter and the jar has potential to freeze, you can
    also make sun water through a window pane. Be prepared for it to take a bit longer.

    being careful. It is extremely potent and can actually alter your personality
    for a few hours (12 at most in my experience).'

    the day meticulously cleaning my house. I didn’t even realize I had drank *that
    specific water* until later and was shocked by how powerful it was.

- en: Consume it carefully, but also note that sun water can be great if you need
    to invoke a specific energy quickly. Make sure to check what sign the sun is in
    astrologically before you do so, as this will influence how you think and act.

- en: If the sun is in Capricorn, then you may become more work and goal oriented,
    but if the sun is in Cancer, you’re likely to become family oriented or care more
    about your home and pets.

- en: The sign the sun is in will influence your personality and thoughts, but sun
    water in general gives you an added boost of energy.

- en: '**You can also use sun water in spell work**. Sun water is extremely potent
    and works well for spells that need a lot of energy. It’s helpful when cleansing
    negative energies or entities, when casting defensive spells, in love or fame
    spells, and when working with sun deities.'

- en: Use sun water in your spell work whenever it feels right intuitively. Don’t
    forget to double check that the *sign* the sun is in works with your spell as
    well. For example, Aries sun water would work well in a protection spell while
    Pisces sun water would work better in a psychic enhancement spell.

    a drop will add to the magic.

    In Bath, the Celtic people worshiped Sulis (the goddess of the sun) at a site
    near the thermal springs, making sun water an integral part of the religious culture.
