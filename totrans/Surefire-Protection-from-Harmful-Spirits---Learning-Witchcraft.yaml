    any of them will give you instant protection. A combination of them will also
    work. Carry your stone or stones with you wherever you go.

- en: The next part of this phase involves surrounding yourself with a bright, white
    shield of protective light. Simply envision the light coming from above and covering
    your entire body as well as flooding your whole being with protective shielding.
    Some people find that, during meditation, it is effective to envision the light
    coming from within and surrounding them like a cocoon.

    you. You can make it any color that works for you but white is common for protection.
    Have it extend about one arm’s length outside of your body all around you.

    vibrates at a high frequency and is ideal for allowing your angels, spirit guides
    and the God and the Goddess to protect and shield you.

    your space, you will want to do a proper cleansing. You can obtain Palo Santo
    online and use this holy Amazonian wood to drive the spirits out. This is the
    same wood burned by Shamans. You can also burn sage, frankincense or sandalwood.'

    spirits to leave “now!” Tell them they do not belong and are not welcome. Tell
    them to go back where they came from and to leave. Indicate that you only welcome
    light and healing energies in your space.  You may need to repeat these statements
    until you sense the area has been cleansed.

- en: If, after following the steps for the first two phases you still have an issue
    you will need to communicate with the entity. Be careful. You need to [cast a
    protective circle](https://learningwitchcraft.com/how-to-cast-a-circle-of-protection/)
    around you using sea salt. Be sure to hold onto your protective stones. Activate
    the light of protection and then speak to the spirit. Be firm but calm.

- en: Tell the spirit that you are protected and no harm can come to you and that
    you address the entity with respect. You may go on to let them know that they
    are an intrusion and that while you don’t know their reasons for being near you 
    there is nothing for them.  Tell them you must have them leave and go back where
    they came from. When you are done close the circle.

- en: Keep your stones or orgonite near you at all times. If you feel the negative
    presence simply breathe deeply and visualize your protective light. Ask your angels
    and guides to stay near and keep you safe. If this still does not work, contact
    a reputable psychic or medium skilled in helping people get rid of harmful or
    negative spirits.
