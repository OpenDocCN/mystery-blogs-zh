I got a laugh out of the notion ''if God is not helping, the devil will.'' You can work with Satan, but this is not how it is done. If you wish to use this in your ritual to become a satanist, I suppose you could, but I would convert from a place of love, not contempt. People work with Satan because they feel an affinity towards him, not because they are mad at God for not giving them stuff.

Exactly. People come to Satan (as some call him) because they find something in him that draws them in. They don't come because God did something bad to them. They come from love, not hate

I doubt this'll actually work. I know, it says that it worked in the description, but tell me, is it not possible that descriptions can be faked? Also, people come to Satan because they find something in him they could not find in the Christian God. To actually be a Satanist, you have to come from love for Satan, not hate for the Christian God. Satan will likely not ask for something in return (offerings of fruits could work if you want to give him something) but he won't ask for headless humans. A few drops of blood could suffice too. All in all, don't try this spell
