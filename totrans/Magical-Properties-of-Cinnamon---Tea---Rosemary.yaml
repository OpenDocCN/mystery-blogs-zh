    Cultivating this aromatic spice is an intricate process that requires patience
    and skill.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    rainfall. While they can endure some shade, they prefer well-drained soil and
    consistent warmth.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Harvesting Process**: When a cinnamon tree reaches about two years of age,
    its shoots are cut close to the ground. The outer bark is scraped off, and the
    inner bark is delicately separated in long rolls. These rolls are then left to
    dry, during which they curl into the characteristic quills or sticks we recognize
    as cinnamon.'

    flavor, and potency of cinnamon can vary based on where it’s grown. Ethical sourcing

    sticks and grinding them as needed ensures a fresher, more potent flavor. The
    grinding process releases the spice’s aromatic oils, which can dissipate over
    time in pre-ground varieties.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Storage**: Store cinnamon in a cool, dark place, preferably in an airtight
    container. This practice helps prevent the essential oils in the cinnamon from
    evaporating, thus retaining its potency and aroma. If stored correctly, whole
    cinnamon sticks can last up to three years, while ground cinnamon remains fresh
    for about six months to a year.'
