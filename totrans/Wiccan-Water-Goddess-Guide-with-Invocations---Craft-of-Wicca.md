Pagan water goddesses are female deities in pagan and polytheistic cultures who are associated with water and the sea. They are often seen as protectors of sailors and fishermen, as well as being associated with fertility, renewal, and purification.

 This article gives examples of my favorite pagan water goddesses from different cultures around the world to invoke.

## Yemaya

Yemaya is a Yoruba water goddess from West Africa. She is often depicted as a mermaid or a woman with the lower body of a fish.

 According to Yoruba mythology, Yemaya was born from the primordial waters and gave birth to the first humans. She is seen as a nurturing and loving mother figure and is often invoked for help with fertility, childbirth, and family issues.

In Yoruba culture, Yemaya is also seen as a protector of women and children and is often invoked for help with issues related to fertility, childbirth, and motherhood. She is also associated with the element of water and is often invoked for purification and renewal.

 Yemaya is a popular and widely revered deity in West Africa and is often depicted with a crown of cowries (small seashells) and holding a mirror or a comb. She is often invoked through the use of offerings and prayers and is seen as a powerful source of guidance and protection.

 ### Invocation for Yemaya

Here is a brief invocation ceremony for Yemaya, the Yoruba water goddess:

 Begin by finding a quiet, peaceful space where you can focus on your connection to Yemaya. This could be outside by a body of water, or in a room with a few candles and some calming music.

Take a few deep breaths and allow yourself to relax. Imagine that you are surrounded by the calming energy of the ocean, and allow yourself to be open to Yemaya’s presence.

 Hold a small offering in your hands, such as a shell or a piece of ocean-themed jewelry. This offering is a symbol of your respect and reverence for Yemaya and will help to focus your intention during the ceremony.

 Begin the invocation by speaking aloud the following words:

> Great Yemaya, mother of all living things, I call upon you now. Please hear my prayer and lend your wisdom and guidance to me. I offer you this small gift as a symbol of my respect and appreciation for all that you are and do.

Spend a few moments in quiet contemplation, focusing on your connection to Yemaya and what you hope to gain from the ceremony. You may want to ask for help with a specific problem or situation, or simply seek guidance and support from the goddess.

 When you are ready, thank Yemaya for her presence and guidance, and close the ceremony by saying:

> Great Yemaya, I thank you for your wisdom and guidance. I will carry your love and guidance with me always. Farewell, until we meet again.

You can then take a few more moments to sit quietly and reflect on the ceremony, or you can end it by extinguishing any candles or incense you may have used. You can also leave the offering as a symbol of your gratitude to Yemaya.

 ## Sedna

Sedna is an Inuit water goddess who is associated with the sea and marine animals. She is believed to be the ruler of the underworld and is often depicted as a mermaid or a woman with the tail of a fish.

 According to Inuit mythology, Sedna was a woman who was cast into the sea by her father. As she drowned, her fingers transformed into seals, and her hair became the whales and other sea creatures. After her death, Sedna became the ruler of the underworld, where she was responsible for controlling the animals of the sea.

In Inuit culture, Sedna is revered as a powerful and mysterious figure. She is often invoked for help with fertility, childbirth, and other matters related to the home and family. She is also seen as a protector of sailors and fishermen and is often invoked for help with safe passage on the sea.

 In addition to her role as a fertility and protection goddess, Sedna is also associated with the element of water and is often invoked for purification and renewal.

 ## Nüwa

Nüwa is a Chinese water goddess who is revered in traditional Chinese mythology. She is often depicted as a serpent or dragon and is associated with the creation of the world and the repair of the sky.

According to legend, Nüwa was the daughter of the creator god, Fu Xi, and was responsible for repairing the sky after it was damaged by the evil Gong Gong. To repair the sky, Nüwa used five-colored stones to patch the holes, and she also created humans from the yellow earth to populate the world.

 In addition to her role as a creator goddess, Nüwa is also associated with fertility and the nurturing of life. She is often depicted holding a bowl of water, which is a symbol of her life-giving powers.

In Chinese mythology, Nüwa is often seen as a protector of the people and is revered for her wisdom and her ability to bring harmony to the world.
