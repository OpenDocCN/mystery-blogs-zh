- en: This goes with my avian mentality meditation. This gives you wings. I did this
    completely for fun and I don't intend for it to work. So don't comment and hate
    that is either not possible or didn't work. Still in testing. Message me if it
    worked tho that would be very intetesting.

    a pair of wings, big, broad and fit for me. I do believe that this will work.
    I wish to fly above the clouds to protect the birds. To keep r the wind from my
    face. Please. This is my wish. So mote it be.

- en: Yes. It is also clearly stated in my profile what I am doing, what is your point?
    This site is for real witches to discuss Real Magik and real witchcraft. The line
    about entertainment in the legal section is to protect the owner. I comment on
    all spells that are posted to this site, regardless of if they were indented for
    fun or not. I have seen you recently arguing with members who actually understand
    Magik and witchcraft, and looking at your posts on the site, I would suggest you
    listen to those members, you might learn something about Real Magik and not Hogwarts
    nonsense.
