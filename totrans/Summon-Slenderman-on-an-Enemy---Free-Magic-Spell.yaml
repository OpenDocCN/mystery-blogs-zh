  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You do realize that with belief you can create a tulpa and since so many people
    know about Slenderman you can use their fear and knowledge to enhance the tulpas
    power. Thus the spell can 100% work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am aware you can create a tulpa in Slenderman's image however, this spell
    claims you are summoning THE Slenderman, which is not real, to kill someone, which
    will not work with this spell. At best, you could pool your energy into a tupla
    or other symbol to curse the person, but the spell claims you summon Slenderman
    to potentially kill your enemy. Since that is what the spell claims, it will not
    work that way.

  prefs: []

    in spells and it's never made a difference.

- en: You know if you think about it your enemy might know how to use magik and if
    they get there hands on this spell who knows what will happen this spell honest!y
    scares the crap out of me. And I am staying away from this till I'm better at
    casting because I'm scared for my life that I will miscast and never see the light
    of day again because I'm not very good I had one successful spell and one that
    possibly worked but I had to go home before I could fully clarify.
