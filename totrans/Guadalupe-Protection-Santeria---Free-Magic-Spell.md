**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   One picture or sculpture of the Virgin Mary.

 Pray to it and ask it to write protection spells for you. Keep everything under oath, though, or she will be upset because this is more like tribal/shaman aka witch doctor from Nigeria's Yoruba ancient tribe kinda stuff than anything.

Pray to the goddess until it replies, it will take much faith for it to work. Ask for the sculpture to write a spell for you like anyone would write a spell. Or you can just ask the Virgin Mary at a Catholic Church to protect you. You can buy them from any botanica, a santeria superstore. Hurry Sale Ends Soon! Google Botanica in your city.

Here is a starter image. Remember, faith is the key to everything you do with santeria. Also, the main thing to remember is the oath of silence when working on Santeria.
