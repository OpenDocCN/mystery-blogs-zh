- en: Moon-Mars aspects are all about how your emotions affect your actions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With some of these aspects, your emotions may *drive* your actions, while other
    times the two parts of yourself conflict. For example, you may do things that
    are in conflict with your emotions or feel pulled in two different directions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s very important to look at the *signs* that both the Moon and Mars are in
    since the astrological signs will shape how these aspects manifest.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon conjunct Mars, passion is a large part of your personality, sometimes
    to the point of hotheadedness. Your emotions can run you and cause you to take
    action that you later regret. You may be both impulsive and restless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily, Moon conjunct Mars can *help* when you need to do something that scares
    you. Once you find the emotional reason for doing something, you’re not afraid
    to dive in and get the job done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect means that you have trouble hiding your emotions. Usually, you need
    to actually share your emotions with others in order to get them off your chest.
    You may find it really difficult to hide what you’re feeling, though your emotions
    can sometimes burst out in the form of a temper tantrum.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon conjunct Mars means that you are a generally rash person. You need to get
    your emotions “out” or you’ll implode, but this can harm others when they bear
    the brunt of your outbursts. Depending on the sign of this conjunction, your temper
    can rise up quickly and dissipate just as swiftly, leaving others reeling in your
    wake.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The upside of this personality trait is that you’re *also* pretty honest, if
    only because you simply can’t hide how you feel. Your feelings show through your
    actions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are the classic definition of a “hothead” with Moon conjunct Mars, at least
    in the area of this conjunction; look to the house that Moon conjunct Mars sits
    in to determine where these characteristics will most show themselves. You may
    also find that you’re especially passionate, expressive, brave, or sexual in these
    areas. You know how to take initiative and certainly don’t *lack* the energy to
    get something started.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon conjunct Mars natal, you can feel a lot of pressure to perform, take
    action, and make something of yourself. This can put you on the defensive if others
    question your actions. While much of this will depend on the exact placement,
    there *is* a tendency for you to struggle with the criticisms’ of others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may have trouble seeing *other* people’s emotions clearly because you’re
    always caught up in your own emotions and actions. You’re probably loyal to others
    when you see it, but you may not be the most observant, especially when you’re
    in the grips of your own emotional issues. Moon conjunct Mars can lend some “Aries”
    vibes to the native. You don’t *mean* to run over others but are simply too excitable
    to slow down and really *see* what’s going on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This conjunction tends to make your emotional reactions aggressive rather than
    passive-aggressive, though this will be influenced by the sign and degree of your
    Moon. Most of the time, you’re very forward: both passionate and aggressive. This
    can be a really great thing if you can channel this energy for your career.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon conjunct Mars, you need to get your emotional energy *out*. It’s important
    that you find a way to do this or you’ll literally implode and may take your aggression
    out on other people. At the very worst, you can descend into madness. Focus on
    using this aspect to motivate yourself and further your own goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also important that you learn how to express your emotions in a clear way.
    Sometimes, Mars will cloud the Moon and make your emotions feel too difficult
    to actually enunciate, so you simply explode without *really* *e*xplaining how
    you feel, making it impossible for others to understand you. Work on developing
    emotional intelligence and using your Mars to push yourself towards giving a real
    explanation instead of fueling your temper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon conjunct Mars, you ultimately have a *lot* of energy that can be channeled
    for good or bad. You must get the energy *out*, but it is up to you to determine *how* you
    do this.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Moon trine Mars aspect in the natal chart indicates that you are emotionally
    charged. This can be both a positive and a negative aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your emotions fuel your energy, so you find it easy to accomplish tasks when
    you’re *excited* about the work you’re doing. In fact, certain tasks feel effortless
    to you because your feelings line up with your actions. You have a strong sense
    of motivation when you want to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you can also be emotionally reactive. You have a need to express your
    feelings in totality (without holding back), regardless of whether your feelings
    are positive or negative. Your emotional energy needs to go *somewhere*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With just a bit of practice, you can learn how to control and direct your emotions.
    You do need to get your emotions *out* but you can choose how to do this. For
    example, if you don’t know much about your own emotions then you may find that
    they bubble up and explode at random. But if you put in the world to learn how
    to describe what you’re feeling then you can be a really effective communicator
    and can become someone who deals with problems head-on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your ability to be blunt is one of your best attributes as long as you use your
    words *kindly*. With Moon trine Mars, try to remember that *other* people have
    emotions too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon trine Mars indicates that you’re not afraid to feel your own emotions (of
    all types), making you a passionate person. You may become attached to the people
    and things you feel strongly about. You can also become a wonderful leader by
    learning how to motivate people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like with most other Moon-Mars aspects, it’s essential that you first *learn* about
    your emotions and how to adequately explain/describe them before you can access
    the best parts of this aspect. You have everything you need to succeed and with
    a little effort, you can be an extremely effective leader, worker, and motivator!
    In fact, you can even learn how to use your rage productively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon trine Mars, you are probably quite sexual and adventurous, at least
    when *you* feel like it. Sex and emotions are intrinsically linked for you. Even
    if you aren’t really dating someone, you still may enjoy emotional intimacy being
    mixed in with sex. You need *some* sort of emotional connection to feel complete
    on a physical level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may have more success with a partner who is also strong-willed or you’ll
    start “running” the relationship. You need someone who can stop you in your tracks
    and tell you when you’re getting out of hand, otherwise, your temper tantrums
    can become monumental.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, Moon trine Mars indicates a very successful person who isn’t afraid
    to try new things. Work to *master* your emotions instead of shutting them down
    and you’ll find your life grow in numerous ways.
  prefs: []

- en: Moon Sextile Mars
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mars sextile Moon indicates passion, bravery, enthusiasm, and potential for
    success in all areas. The benefits of this aspect include making you more daring,
    charismatic, sexy, and captivating to the senses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, this aspect indicates that you have a way with people. Your expressive
    and energetic nature makes you quite popular. Other people are drawn to the balance
    of emotional energy within you. Unlike the trine and the conjunction, you don’t
    have massive temper tantrums but simply have a warm and pleasing energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect has a competitive as well as cooperative element to it. Again, you
    appear quite balanced. You’re not afraid to go for what you want but don’t *need* to
    win against others. This balance with Moon sextile Mars can make you very successful
    in life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taking the lead is a way to express your independence while still being part
    of the group. You appear courageous and driven but also have regard for others,
    so most people will accept you as a leader. You’re also quite brave and aren’t
    afraid to stand up for yourself or others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon sextile Mars means that you don’t like to lose, but you also aren’t likely
    to blow up. You probably have a bit more *strategy* than other aspects. You need
    to prove that you’re successful but you don’t mind fighting multiple challenges
    to reach your goal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that with Moon sextile Mars, you have the *opportunity* to fuel
    your actions by using your emotions. Go after what you *want* rather than what
    you *think* you need and you’ll be much more successful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also have the opportunity to learn how to understand your emotions. The
    more “therapy” work you do to put labels to your emotions, the more successful
    you will be.
  prefs: []

- en: Moon Opposition Mars
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon opposition Mars, the Moon’s emotional needs are at odds with what
    Mars wants. In one area of the chart, Mars is urged to act, but the Moon is afraid
    because you believe it’s too dangerous, so the Moon part of your personality tries
    to stop Mars.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may experience a push-pull from these two conflicting needs and feel like
    you struggle to actually *do something*. You’re likely to feel that your life
    is very stagnant with Moon opposite Mars.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This usually indicates a *parenting* issue. Your mother (or other nurturing
    parent/guardian from childhood) taught you that the world is dangerous. She may
    have shown you that inaction is better and safer. Now, these subconscious beliefs
    pervade this area of your life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon opposite Mars, you have almost taken on a part of your mother as yourself.
    When she speaks up within you, you struggle to take action. You feel too afraid
    to override your *mother’s* fear, even though it is not your own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, your mother might actually be right if you have this aspect. Some
    of the things your Mars wants *can* be too dangerous or sudden. Therefore, it’s
    important that you find a balance that feels right to *you.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you choose to ignore this Moon opposition Mars aspect then you will find
    that this energy pops up over and over, forcing you to choose. For example, one
    client of mine (with this aspect) often has relationship dilemmas in her family.
    One side of the family will do something to the other, who then look to her for
    answers. She feels unable to speak up to either side or to assert her own boundaries
    and instead acts out passive-aggressively towards both sides (because the feelings
    have to go *somewhere)* but makes no real changes. Over time, we’ve found that
    it takes a *while* to heal this aspect. It’s the small, slow growth that matters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you aren’t able to take the actions that you *want* to take then you can
    find yourself trying to live for others. This is your Moon being activated. It
    might seem OK at first, but the aggression of Mars builds up inside of you. Eventually,
    you will get angry and act out, then the cycle begins again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must find a balance between action and feelings with Moon opposition Mars.
    The way to do this is to find *yourself*. You might always look to *others* to
    guide you as your mother did, but you will never really resolve this aspect unless
    you go inside and find what *you* want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon opposition Mars indicates that you need to merge these two opposite points
    by first learning about your emotions (naming them, understanding what you feel,
    etc.) and then separating your emotions from other people’s. This process will
    give you the courage to act over time. To heal this aspect, emotional intelligence
    is absolutely necessary.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon square Mars natal makes you passionate, willful, and sometimes even insatiable.
    You may fear vulnerability and act tougher than you really are inside.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might be your own worst enemy in some situations. Because of the Moon square
    Mars aspect, you do not have a healthy outlet to release your emotions. You bottle
    them up inside until they explode or come out sideways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon square Mars makes you afraid of vulnerability. This is where most of your
    emotional issues stem from, including your fear of intimacy. You tend to protect *yourself*
    through a variety of methods but this does not allow you to have truly close relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way that Moon square Mars expresses itself can vary. You might act overly
    tough and aggressive, take massive risks in life, and seem selfish, or be too
    cautious and a people-pleaser. Either way, you pretend that you don’t have your
    *own* sad and scary emotions. You hide any emotions that feel too vulnerable so
    deep down that they’re impossible to access.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might feel that outwardly expressing your anger will hurt the people around
    you, but your anger instead comes out sideways. You’ll find that with Moon square
    Mars, you’re never totally successful at suppressing your more negative emotions.
    The same goes for your sexual desires, which may be difficult for you to express
    in an authentic way. Again, these come out sideways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These emotional issues often pop up because of the way that you were nurtured.
    You may have nurture or “mother” issues that are still affecting you, but you’re
    too afraid to be vulnerable and to dive into these feelings. This aspect indicates
    a lot of deep hurts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon square Mars, you must learn how to express your emotions and act on
    them in a way that isn’t destructive. Like most other Moon/Mars aspects, you need
    to develop emotional intelligence through learning about emotions. Figure out
    what you feel and why on the surface level before delving deeper to your shadow
    self and bigger hurts. Learn how to actually express your emotions to other people
    instead of saying what you think they want to hear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Moon square Mars aspect suggests a lack of emotional intelligence about *yourself *because
    you’re afraid of dealing with the large amounts of pain inside of you. This creates
    the tendency to avoid your emotions by taking actions that don’t trigger these
    feelings, but the actual issues never go away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will find your true power when you deal with the Moon square Mars aspect
    head-on. It will be painful and tricky to accomplish, but airing out your deepest
    hurts will help you live a fuller, happier life where you do what you *want*.
