  zh: 什么是异教节日？
- en: With the holiday season coming up fast (and let’s face it, no matter what time
    of year it actually is it always seems to be Christmas season in retail), it’s
    time to once again suffer through people yelling about the “War on Christmas”.
    Some people just want to complain, and this ridiculous concept lets them do so.

  zh: 随着假期季节的快速来临（无论实际上是什么时间，零售业总是似乎是圣诞季节），又到了再次忍受人们大声抱怨“反对圣诞节”的时候。有些人只是想抱怨，而这个荒谬的概念让他们可以这么做。
- en: For the more introspective and curious out there, however, the “War on Christmas”
    may have inspired some questions. Namely, where did Christmas come from, and what
    holidays exist that aren’t Christian? Not just for the Christmas season, but all
    year around? It’s well known that Christmas has its roots in pagan holidays, specifically
    Saturnalia, and that many of the traditions are nothing more than either co-opted
    pagan traditions or simple folk traditions that have continued.

  zh: 然而，对于更内省和好奇的人来说，“反对圣诞节”的现象可能激发了一些问题。主要是，圣诞节的起源是什么，还有哪些非基督教的节日存在？不仅仅是在圣诞节季节，而是全年？众所周知，圣诞节起源于异教节日，特别是Saturnalia，并且许多传统不过是被挪用的异教传统或者继续存在的简单民间传统。
- en: But what about other holidays? Not just holidays that the United States recognizes,
    but in general? What are the **pagan holidays**, and have any traditions from
    those holidays become folk traditions that have been wrapped up into more mainstream
    holidays and festivals?

  zh: 季节性节日
- en: Every culture throughout time has had their own seasonal holidays, and pagans
    are no different. Of course, since “pagan” is more of an umbrella term for non-major
    world religions than a religion in and of itself, there are a huge number of different
    holiday traditions to choose from!

  zh: 所有文化在历史上都有自己的季节性节日，异教徒也不例外。当然，“异教徒”更多地是指非主要世界宗教的总称，而不是宗教本身，因此有许多不同的节日传统可供选择！
- en: However, modern pagans tend to follow what’s referred to as the “Wheel of the
    Year”. It’s a circle of seasonal holidays, and while it’s been solidified quite
    a bit from Wiccan practices, it’s a good reference since most spiritual beliefs
    throughout time had quite a bit to do with the changing of the seasons.

  zh: 然而，现代异教徒倾向于遵循所谓的“年轮”。这是一个季节性节日的循环，虽然它从女巫教的实践中得到了一定程度的确立，但它是一个很好的参考，因为大多数精神信仰在不同时间都与季节变化有很大关系。
- en: Yule, the holiday most non-pagans will likely have the most familiarity with,
    is the winter holiday. It more or less coincides with the Winter Solstice (the
    longest night of the year), though some people celebrate the Winter Solstice as
    its own holiday. Many of the folk traditions of Christmas are the same traditions
    practiced by pagans during Yule, such evergreen plants (mistletoe, pine trees,
    etc.), as well as gift giving and traditionally significant foods during feasts.[fsbProduct

  zh: 尤尔（Yule）是大多数非异教徒可能最熟悉的节日，是冬季节日。它与冬至（一年中最长的夜晚）大致同时，尽管有些人将冬至作为独立的节日来庆祝。许多圣诞节的民间传统与尤尔期间异教徒实践的传统相同，如常青植物（槲寄生、松树等），以及在盛宴期间赠送礼物和传统重要食物。[fsbProduct

- en: Imbolc, the festival celebrating the first day of spring, is the next holiday
    in the Wheel of the Seasons. Many Imbolc practices have found their way into mainstream
    folk traditions, such as spring cleaning and stories and songs celebrating the
    finding of new love.

  zh: 伊姆尔克（Imbolc），庆祝春天第一天的节日，是季节之轮中的下一个节日。许多伊姆尔克的习俗已经渗透到了主流民间传统中，比如春季大扫除，以及庆祝新恋情发现的故事和歌曲。
- en: Following that is Ostara, or the Vernal Equinox. Have you ever wondered with
    the Easter holiday seems to be based on the solar calendar instead of a fixed
    date like so many other holidays? This is due to influences from the Jewish calendar
    (and their holiday, Passover), as well as pagan influences.

  zh: 其后是奥斯塔拉，或者春分。你是否曾经想过为什么复活节节日似乎是基于太阳历，而不是像许多其他节日一样是一个固定的日期？这是由于犹太历（及其节日逾越节）以及异教影响的影响。
- en: Beltane is the next major holiday, which is a holiday where you can clearly
    see multiple influences. Modern Wiccans tend to use practices following English
    and Germanic traditions, treating Beltane as a fertility holiday (as made popular
    by the NSFW song “First of May” by Jonathan Coultone). Many other pagans, however,
    follow Celtric traditions. These traditions celebrate Beltane as more of a time
    of new growth rather than fertility in specific. Imbolc involved fertility, Beltane
    involves rituals urging the strength and prosperity of the seeds that have begun
    to sprout, both literally and figuratively. There are also many rituals involving
    fire and the creation of a Beltane bonfire.

  zh: 贝尔塔尼是接下来的主要节日，这是一个节日，你可以清楚地看到多种影响。现代女巫通常遵循英格兰和日耳曼传统的实践，将贝尔塔尼视为生育的节日（正如乔纳森·库尔顿的“五月的第一天”这首NSFW歌曲所流行）。然而，许多其他异教徒遵循凯尔特传统。这些传统将贝尔塔尼作为一个新生长的时间，而不是特定生育的时间来庆祝。伊姆博尔克涉及生育，贝尔塔尼涉及鼓励那些已经开始发芽的种子的力量和繁荣，无论是字面上还是比喻上。还有许多涉及火焰和贝尔塔尼篝火的仪式。

    the harvest festivals. Pagans usually break bread to celebrate the first fruits
    of the harvest season.

  zh: 马本，或者秋分，是中间的收获节日。许多秋季南瓜和水果的传统在现代感恩节的传统中幸存下来。
- en: And of course, Samhain is perhaps the most well known of the harvest festivals.
    It’s believed that the barrier between the world of the living and the world of
    the dead is the thinnest during this time. It’s the time when the living world
    finally begins to die, fading into longer and longer nights and the eventual frozen
    landscape that is winter. This is why it was often celebrated as a holiday to
    honor the dead. In spite of some modern thoughts, Halloween, or All Hallowed Eve,
    is not actually one of the pagan holidays. It was a holiday started by the Catholic
    church, incorporating many of the traditions of the three harvest festivals, in
    an attempt to pacify local villages as the Church grew and spread.

  zh: 当然，萨温可能是最为人熟知的收获节日。据信在这个时候，生者世界和死者世界之间的屏障是最薄的。这是生者世界最终开始消亡，进入越来越长的黑夜和最终的冰冻景观——冬季的时间。这就是为什么它经常被庆祝为一个纪念亡者的节日。尽管有一些现代的想法，万圣节，或者万圣节前夜，实际上并不是异教的节日之一。它是天主教会开始的一个节日，融合了三个收获节日的许多传统，试图在教会不断扩展和传播时平息当地的村庄。
