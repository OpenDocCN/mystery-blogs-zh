# Telepathic Location Spell

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This spell is very useful, it helps you locate things you cant find through telepathy. It's a spell I created, and have used many times with uncanny accuracy.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A lost item

*   Experience with chi (I'll elaborate in the instructions)

*   calm mind

## Casting Instructions for 'Telepathic Location Spell'

This is a telepathic spell. If your thinking right now: ''Oh no I'm not telepathic... I guess I can't use this then'', your wrong. If your not naturally telepathic (which if you were you really wouldn't need to read this anyway) you can still learn to use the powers of telepathy and it's not that hard, you just need the right instructions. To use the telepathic abilities that you have locked away inside you, you must first practice a Taoist meditation which unlocks your chi:

When first practicing this meditation you must sit down in a quiet relaxing area with no distractions. Sit down in an upright position and clear your mind. Hold your hand in front of you as if you were holding a ball. Think of the air floating around between your hands. After a minute or two imagine the air between your hands being in a balloon. Then after a minute imagine that the balloon is now a beach ball. After another minute or two imagine it is now a basketball. After that a Tire and even after that imagine a really high pressure tire. When you've reached that point, give your hands a slight push and you should feel a pressure. This is your chi. Breathe in and out slowly. When you breathe in you should feel a pull and when you breathe out you should feel a push.

After you've practiced this meditation to the point where you can feel you chi with the slightest effort (You will come to notice that you can only do it once or twice a day at first). Then start taking one of your hands and holding over something else. Try to feel the same pressure you felt doing it with both hands. When you get that down to a simplicity you are ready to perform the spell.

What you practice in the last paragraph is establishing a direct connection with the chi of the object you hold your hand over. It can be done at any distance by concentrating on the object with your eyes. The same can be done by concentrating on an object with your minds eye.

To do the spell you must clear your mind and think of the object you are missing (only that object). Hold out your hand and feel around for the object, when you feel a push, your hand is facing the direction of the object you are thinking of.

--Important information--

When casting it would be wise to be against a wall because it only works 180 degrees (meaning the object could be behind you rather than in front of you), it really narrows it down.
Also when you practice the spell don't practice as if you were looking for an object, because knowing where the object is, will cause major confusion and make you mess up. Practice using the meditations I taught you above... the spell will work when you need it.
