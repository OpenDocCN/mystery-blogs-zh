While I have not made a simmer pot with these specific herbs together, this should work.

I agree, this does indeed ring as an effective process. All of the herbs used are related with clearing and protection, and should be pungent enough to carry into the air well from the simmer.

As a note on the affirmations, they are pretty good as well. Though I would worry less about making them whyme and just use whatever wording that I resonated with in the moment and followed the intent of the working. That's just personal preference though.
