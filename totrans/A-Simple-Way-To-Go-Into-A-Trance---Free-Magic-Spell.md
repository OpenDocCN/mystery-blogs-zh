 ## Casting Instructions for 'A Simple Way To Go Into A Trance'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**Lay down on your bed, or sit up, whichever you prefer. Close your eyes, breathe deeply in and out, but as you breathe in, hold your breath while you count to six, and the breathe out. Repeat that process for about 5 minutes. After about 5 minutes of doing the breathing, imagine yourself going up a ladder step by step, and then imagine on the ladder, yourself falling backwards, down and down, until your body starts feeling tingly, which is normal.
