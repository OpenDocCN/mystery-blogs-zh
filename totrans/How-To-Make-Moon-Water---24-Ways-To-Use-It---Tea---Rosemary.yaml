  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Source a vessel (I like to use glass but you can use plastic if necessary)
    and fill it with water. Make sure your water is safe to drink if you intend to
    consume your moon charged water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Place your vessel under the moonlight *after* the sun has set. Speaking
    out loud (if possible), ask the moon to infuse this water with its energy. If
    you believe in animism, it can be helpful to leave an offering for the moon, such
    as incense, food, beverage, or even a song. This is a kind of thanks for lending
    its energy to charge your water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    jar with your intentions. Mediate on the outcome you want and on your goals with
    this water. The water will now draw in the essence of the moon once it rises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    somewhere away from the light of the sun, so that the solar energy doesn’t change
    the essence of your moon water. I like to store my moon water in a closed drawer
    or put a cloth over the jar.
