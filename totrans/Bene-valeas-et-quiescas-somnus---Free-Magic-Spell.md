This spell has really helped me when I have nightmares.

At least, if you wanna practice spell, you must know the meaning. I just Translate: Bene=well/rightly/with good , valeas=be well, valetudo=health, quiescas=quiet, somnus=sleep (well good(health) & quiet sleep), venio=come, meum= my/mine (come to me/mine) mens=mind, agitare=move/shake/drive, molem/moles= Large mass, bulk, pile (the mind moves the mass). Please be understand, if you don't know what is the meaning and you just do it, sometimes it could make graziness/insanity ,please give the translation english along with the spell, well if you make any spell again.

molem (last word) does not mean what is said? Or I am mistaken..

I personally wouldn't use anything where the chanting is in Latin or another language not well understood by the caster. It is far too easy for the writer to misuse a written language they are not fluent in.

Again, if you do not speak a specific language, do not cast in that language, you will be too focused on the part you do not understand. That said, a soothing tea, relaxing/meditating before bed, then saying a chant similar to a lullaby does work. You just ground energy instead of charge it.
