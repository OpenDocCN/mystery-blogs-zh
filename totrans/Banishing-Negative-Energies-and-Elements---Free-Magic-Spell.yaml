    cozy, silent and you're sure not to be disturbed for at least half an hour. and
    build up some processional energy, try burning some frankincense incense or whatever
    works for you.

    state envision a cone of power going anti-clockwise (for banishing) like a cyclone
    above your house, slowly bring the cone (which I think is supposed to be upside
    down - as in big part on the bottom) down into your house and envision all the
    little nasty energies being taken up into the cyclone squealing and kicking and
    being enveloped by the giant cone.

- en: Drive the cone down below your house and deep into the earth and let all the
    little nasty creatures out there, once you are sure nothing is clinging take the
    cone back up into your house and go through the process again, a little bit stronger
    and more determined this time, so as any smart little things can be washed out
    in the rinse cycle (lol).

- en: Empty them deep into the earth again and let the cone rise out of your house
    and disperse - Relax and feel the positive energy and the lack of negativity in
    your house. Focus on these thoughts and keep the negative thoughts far from your
    head or they will feed on it and possibly come back.
