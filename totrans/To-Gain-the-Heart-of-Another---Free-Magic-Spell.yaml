    the following spell. You will need some small object that they have touched or
    held. This thing can be of any sort and need not be owned by them. You will also
    need a piece of fine cloth, large enough so that the object may be wrapped therein.

    whom you desire Your own name And also the following words: " To gain thy heart
    I keep thee near that in our hearts we shall be one." Wrap the object in the cloth
    and bind it securely with a length of cord. Take two short candles and place them
    near the object, but at opposing ends. Light the candles, and once lighted, do
    not move the object. Repeat the following incantation:'

    candles can be lighted and extinguished as needed as long as the object is not
    moved. When one of the candles burns out on its own, extinguish the remaining
    candle and place it along with the wrapped object in a safe place.'
