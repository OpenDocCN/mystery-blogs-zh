    Once you have finished dancing and connecting with the energies thank the Virgin
    Mary and the spirits in the reverse order and a counterclockwise fashion. Do not
    dismiss them. They will leave on their own. This is a ritual about connection,
    and nothing more. You do not need to make offerings, but you can if you want. The
    ritual dance and the raising of energies is enough of an offering for the spirits.
    They crave connection just as much as we do. Allow these moments to do just that.
    When you are done, blow out all of the candles and just go about your day.**'
