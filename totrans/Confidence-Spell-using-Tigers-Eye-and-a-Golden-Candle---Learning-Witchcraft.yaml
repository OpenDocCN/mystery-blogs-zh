    your hands. Then look into the flame. As you are, imagine that there is a golden
    light that is shining form above down on you (close your eyes if that helps you
    with visualizing this). Make the light as vibrant and beautiful as you can within
    your imagination. The light represents the unconditional love that the Universe
    has to give you. As you are bathing in the golden energy, imagine yourself in
    the eyes of the Goddess or God or the Universe. Think of the Universe as love
    you the way a parent does a child, which is loving you simply for your existence,
    without any conditions being attached. Then feel your heart open to the energy.See
    this light growing larger and larger, first filling up the circle and next the
    entire room. For the visualization, take as much time as necessary.

    feel all this energy being absorbed by the tiger’s eye crystal. Visualize the
    golden light as it pours into the crystal until all of it is contained within.

    use it for tapping into unconditional love’s golden energy by meditating with
    it and holding it each time you feel the need for a boost of confidence. You will
    begin to naturally feel over time the confidence comes from really loving yourself
    unconditionally.
