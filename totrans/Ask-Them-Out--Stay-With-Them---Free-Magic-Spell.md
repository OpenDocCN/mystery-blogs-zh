might work, just remember once you start dating the energy will wear off, so build a strong relationship, or it will end. no spell is permanent, you will need to continue feeding it energy if you wish to rely on a spell to keep a person by your side without getting to know them better.

will it work if they like someone?

As I said, this spell could work, though how effective I'm not sure. If the person already likes you, it will work in the spells favour, but you still have to work on the relationship. Spells fade away over time because you're either not actively feeding energy into it or you achieved your goal and the energy is no longer needed.
