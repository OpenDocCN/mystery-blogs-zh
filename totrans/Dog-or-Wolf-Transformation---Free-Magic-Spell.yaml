    remember to stay on the ground and don't really move from where the spell was
    cast, otherwise the transformation may fail.

- en: The ''Woof woof bark bark'' part honestly made me laugh lol. Anyway, this is
    a fake spell, but if someone's genuinely interested in this sort of thing they
    could look into astral shifting.
