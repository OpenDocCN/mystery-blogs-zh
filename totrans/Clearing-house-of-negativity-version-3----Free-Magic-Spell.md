**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Glass container

*   Salt

*   5 old pennies

*   Water

fill the glass container halfway with salt. put the pennies together in a circle, then fill the glass with water, almost to the top but not completely. This is sometimes best to do with a jar. do not close the container, but leave it out in the open. Do not touch it, or it will mess up its protective energy and you'd have to make another one. Over time the container will begin to look like its made of very beautiful crystal, and is a reminder of how it soaks up the negativity from the area.
