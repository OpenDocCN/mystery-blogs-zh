    It’s a good opportunity to retell the legend of the Oak King and the Holly King,
    personifications of winter and summer in various traditions. This is how the story
    goes:'

- en: Long ago, our land was ruled by two Kings, who were brothers. The younger brother
    wore oak leaves as a crown, and was known as **the Oak King**. The older brother
    wore holly leaves as a crown, and was known as **the Holly King**.

- en: The brothers each felt they knew the best way to rule the land, and they quarreled
    over it all the time. **The Oak King wanted the land to be bright** and hot and
    sunny for the entire year. **The Holly King wanted the land to be dark** and cold
    and sleeping for the entire year.

- en: Both Kings loved a beautiful Lady, and she loved them both. She hated to watch
    them fight. She told them to share the land between them, **one half of the year
    for the Oak King, one half of the year for the Holly King**.

- en: The brothers couldn’t be persuaded to stop their fighting. One hot day, when
    the sun was high in the sky, and it seemed night would never come, the Holly King
    drew his sword against his brother and they fought. Although the Oak King fought
    bravely, **the Holly King struck a mortal blow, and the Oak King fell**.

    King in his arms. The Lady bundled up the body of the Oak King and told the Holly
    King that he must rule the land. She took the Oak King away.'

    in the sky for a bit longer. The days grew shorter, and cooler, the nights, longer
    and colder. Snow started flying. The Holly King could think of nothing but his
    brother.'

- en: Finally, **the land was bare and dead and all plants slept**. Many animals slept
    through the cold times, and those that didn’t sleep had a hard time finding food
    and shelter. One night, when it seemed like the sun would never rise again, the
    Lady came to the Holly King and said, “Don’t despair, your brother isn’t dead.
    Here he is to take his turn at ruling.”

    happily stepped aside for his brother to take his place** as King of the land.

    time. **The land grew green again**, and the plants and animals awoke.

    the dark time. And this is the story our ancestors told to explain how our seasons
    were created.'
