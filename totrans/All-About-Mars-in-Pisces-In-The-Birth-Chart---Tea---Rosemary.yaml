    Mars in Pisces is a bit of an enigma. Pisces is generally peaceful and emotional
    while Mars is active and aggressive.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mars in Pisces is known as the “peaceful warrior.” Although Mars in Pisces people
    can be extremely driven, they’re also emotional and fantastical. They ride the
    waves of emotion and ambition as they come and don’t fret when they’re just not
    feeling it.

    may happen *to* you because you struggle to control what’s happening.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mars in Pisces drive is always tied to emotion. If you don’t know what you
    want then you have no strong feelings either way. Your moods change often so your
    drive is likely to change, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have bursts of energy tied to emotion that are coupled with periods of inaction.
    With Mars in Pisces, you’re often moody, so your drive is completely tied to your
    frame of mind and changes quite a bit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Practicality will certainly kill your drive. Because you thrive on emotions
    and fantasies, being forced to be practical hurts your motivation.
  prefs: []

    unless you’re in the right emotional space. Others may struggle to understand
    this, but it’s simply the way you’re wired with Mars in Pisces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of your emotions are unconscious so it’s nearly impossible for you to control
    them. This also means that you don’t have much control over your drive and motivation
    with Mars in Pisces. Intellectual reasoning won’t help you; something must personally
    and emotionally tie you to a project in order to keep you engaged.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    build up energy because you feel *so* acutely. This energy must be released in
    some way (by journaling, expressing yourself creatively, working out, etc.) or
    it will manifest as an outburst.
  prefs: []

    a quick burst of anger on someone else but then feel immediately remorseful. You
    can also be passive aggressive and unpredictable.
  prefs: []

    or a vague sickness that’s undiagnosable.
  prefs: []

    Aries might, they can have a lot of difficulty controlling their emotions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the issue simply because they have build up so much anger, like a pressure-cooker.
    Mars in Pisces folks can be a bit melodramatic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sense to other people, but this is because the emotions simply have to go somewhere,
    so these people will get upset at the next available chance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    There is no *controlling* their emotions. They just need to ride them out before

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will typically be successful when you feel emotionally tied to a career.
    For example, someone with Mars in Pisces could be an *amazing* athlete, but this
    is because they feel so passionately about the sport. They simply can’t separate
    emotions from actions.
  prefs: []

    individual right in front of you because you’re looking at your own picture of
    them in your head.
  prefs: []

    feel happy or “high” emotionally, you’re more likely to spend time around them.

    towards the needy or the underdogs because imbalance intrigues you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Mars in Pisces, you probably love the rush of dopamine you get when you
    first meet someone. Pisces is all about the “first date butterflies.”  You want
    to live in your fantasies, but this is much easier to do when you first meet someone
    than it is in a long-term relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because your attraction is so specific, you can be intrigued by someone one
    moment and gone the next. It might be confusing for others, but your mind changes
    according to your moods and fantasies, so there is no way for the other person
    to really figure you out.
  prefs: []

    Sometimes you can be outgoing and bubbly, while other times you’re moody and withdrawn.
    You have no *clear* baseline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people with Mars in Pisces end up in relationships that are unbalanced
    in some way, whether this is due to money, age, or simply an unequal energy (with
    one partner being much more powerful, controlling, loud, etc.).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    even if your partner has done something that feels completely unforgivable. A
    day later, all is forgotten.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may be very passive or even a little detached, but this is only because
    you’re invested in your own daydream. When you’re caught up in a new idea or fantasy,
    you’re all in, and might not have time for your partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re loyal when you’re feeling romantic. In fact, you won’t be able to think
    of anything *but* your partner with Mars in Pisces. If your fantasy changes, then
    you’re prone to fickleness. It’s difficult for people with Mars in Pisces to stay
    invested over the long haul.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Mars in Pisces, you have a strong need for love.  Sexually, you’re turned
    on by romance, secrecy, privacy, and emotional power imbalances. It’s almost impossible
    for you to separate sex and love.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, you enjoy the idea of the chase. You can easily project your *idea*
    of the other person (rather than who they really are) and the chase gives you
    time to do this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reality is actually a bit of a turn-off for you; sex that is all about fantasy
    and romance is right up your alley. You have to be in the right mood to want anything
    physical; once you’re out of the mood then there’s no recapturing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal is for people with Mars in Pisces to figure out a balance between living
    in a fantasy world (which they always need to some extent) and seeing reality.
    Ideally, they will do a bit of self work and learn how to discern what’s true
    and what’s false without giving up the romantic aura that they crave.

  prefs: []

    crush.

    to pull out all of the romantic stops, to write poetry, to gush about his lover,
    etc. He falls head over heels when he finds someone he likes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    becomes the center of his universe. No one and nothing else matters to him because
    his emotions are what drive him.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will take care of them emotionally by making them feel safe and happy.

    drama by creating an issue. His partner may be very confused about why he’s doing
    this, but the Mars in Pisces man lives in a fantasy some of the time, so the issue
    he has created feels quite real to him.

    he needs by playing the victim. He might unconsciously attract women who feel
    bad for him and want to care for him.

    rest of their chart supports this. These men are likely to find women who want
    to “save” them from their addictions with love. This is a slippery slope that
    isn’t often successful unless a dose of reality is introduced to the relationship.

    hard for him to say exactly what he is upset about because he stuffs his anger
    down.
  prefs: []

    difficult for her to let go of it.
