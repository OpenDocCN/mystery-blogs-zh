- en: This spell enables you to create a fire ball. It takes massive amounts of energy,
    but after MUCH practice, you could create several without wasting a breath! There
    are many different versions, many which are stronger, but this is best for beginners.

    different and usually used for attacks and defenses rather than warmth. If you
    wish for warmth, please click my history box to see my first spell on warmth)

    friend during practice in case all your energy is taken from you.

    hand is memorized beneath your eyelids. (This is the part in which is not always
    necessary after many months of practice.)

    is focused on the building heat and soon will take form. The more energy and belief,
    the better. If it does not work, do not panic. Just repeat the verse a couple
    more times. If you are a very beginner, I recommend patience. I have still not
    mastered this spell, but after months of practice I have created one or two.

    takes no less time but A LOT of energy.
