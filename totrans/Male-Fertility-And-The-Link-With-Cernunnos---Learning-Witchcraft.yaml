- en: Cernunnos is the Celtic God of Fertility. He is also called the Horned God,
    and this spell calls him forward.

- en: To prepare, gather first a green candle. Then, find a few things that Cernunnos
    will like. Ideas include apples and other fruit, beer, acorns and wine. You can
    give him anything, however, as long as you do it with the best of intentions.
    You also want your offering to break down naturally in the environment.

- en: Make sure you have the necessary ingredients and then cast the circle. Light
    the candle and allow yourself to relax and meditate for a moment or two. You want
    your mind to be calm. Once you have achieved this state, become one with nature.
    This is a little easier to do if you are outside. If you are inside, think about
    being in the woods. Picture the trees, the grass and the sky. Think about how
    you are a part of nature. Engage in this for quite some time; do not go on to
    the next step until you think you have done it properly.

    is a great guide for you, but you can also say whatever you are feeling.

- en: After you have said what you wanted to say, sit quietly for a bit. Allow the
    spirit of Cernunnos to wash over you. You can produce the offerings that you brought
    for him at this time as well. If you are inside, simply set the offerings on a
    plate. Later, you can take them outside and find a good place to lay them. Any
    liquids can be poured directly into the Earth. Food should be left on the ground,
    preferably near an oak tree.

    Invite Cernunnos’ spirit to join you. You should feel happiness.
