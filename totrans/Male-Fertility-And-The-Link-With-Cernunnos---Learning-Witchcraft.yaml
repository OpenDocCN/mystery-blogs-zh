  zh: 犹诺斯是凯尔特神话中的生育之神。他也被称为有角神，而这个咒语召唤了他的出现。
- en: To prepare, gather first a green candle. Then, find a few things that Cernunnos
    will like. Ideas include apples and other fruit, beer, acorns and wine. You can
    give him anything, however, as long as you do it with the best of intentions.
    You also want your offering to break down naturally in the environment.

  zh: 为了准备，首先准备一根绿色蜡烛。接着，找到几样犹诺斯会喜欢的东西。想法包括苹果和其他水果，啤酒，橡子和葡萄酒。你可以给他任何东西，只要你怀着最好的意图去做。你也希望你的奉献在环境中自然分解。

- en: Make sure you have the necessary ingredients and then cast the circle. Light
    the candle and allow yourself to relax and meditate for a moment or two. You want
    your mind to be calm. Once you have achieved this state, become one with nature.
    This is a little easier to do if you are outside. If you are inside, think about
    being in the woods. Picture the trees, the grass and the sky. Think about how
    you are a part of nature. Engage in this for quite some time; do not go on to
    the next step until you think you have done it properly.

  zh: 确保你准备好了必要的材料，然后画出圆圈。点燃蜡烛，让自己放松并冥想片刻。你希望你的思绪平静。一旦达到这种状态，与大自然合而为一。如果你在外面的话，这样做会更容易。如果你在室内，想象自己在树林中。想象树木、草地和天空。思考你如何成为大自然的一部分。全身心地投入其中相当长的时间；在你认为做得恰当之前不要进行下一步。
- en: Once you are ready, you should call forth Cernunnos. The spell that follows
    is a great guide for you, but you can also say whatever you are feeling.

- en: After you have said what you wanted to say, sit quietly for a bit. Allow the
    spirit of Cernunnos to wash over you. You can produce the offerings that you brought
    for him at this time as well. If you are inside, simply set the offerings on a
    plate. Later, you can take them outside and find a good place to lay them. Any
    liquids can be poured directly into the Earth. Food should be left on the ground,
    preferably near an oak tree.

  zh: 在你说完你想说的话之后，静静地坐上一会儿。允许犹诺斯的精神洗礼你。你也可以在这时拿出你为他带来的奉献物。如果你在室内，简单地把奉献放在盘子上。稍后，你可以把它们拿到外面，找一个好地方放下。任何液体可以直接倒进大地。食物应该放在地面上，最好靠近橡树。

    Invite Cernunnos’ spirit to join you. You should feel happiness.
