# A Wish Spell to Manifest a Musical Theatre Casting

This is a spell that I came up with to help me in the future with auditions. Remember that with every spell comes intention and action. Don't expect spells to work if you don't act on them. Put your intuition into everything. And most of all, do your research. This spell will work for plays, band auditions, etc. Feel free to change up the wordings to how you see fit. Blessed be.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   9 Bay Leaves

*   9 pieces of sandalwood, preferably big pieces

*   Peppermint, Sage, and Willow

*   Two candles: One purple, the other candle is a color that represents the musical you are wanting to audition for, or the character

*   Salt

*   A bowl

*   Incense. Any will do, but preferably Sandalwood, for wishes, or Dragon's Blood, to increase the spell?s potency.

*   Optional - Any crystal that your intuition is drawn to for this spell. I am drawn to clear quartz and rose quartz. This is optional.

## Casting Instructions for 'A Wish Spell to Manifest a Musical Theatre Casting'

 *   **Cleanse everything with your incense, if you can, cast a circle if you choose, and call on any deities or divine beings to aid you in this spell.**

*   **Fill the bowl with salt. I suggest getting a wide bowl.**

*   **Next, inscribe your purple candle with the following words:
    MANIFEST
    TALENT
    WISH
    You may choose one of these words, or all of them. **

*   **Now, inscribe your color of choosing with the following things:
    Your full name
    The musical / character you want to audition for, or Are auditioning for**

*   **Place these candles into the salt bowl, or on both sides of the bowl, if you feel more comfortable doing so. You may also dress the candles with the herbs I suggested by using peppermint essential oil to help the herbs stick.**

*   **Now, write an affirmation on all 9 bay leaves that correspond to what you want/are auditioning for.**

*   **Affirmations are statements that are said in a way that have already happened, so things like**

*   **“I am”**

*   **“I have”**

*   **“I will” ** **are all good ways to start affirmations. Do not have anything with “I can’t” “I won’t” “I don’t”. It will most likely not work. The affirmations I recommend are “I have been casted as (character name) from (musical name)” or “I am perfect for the role (character name) from (musical name)”.**

*   **Do the same with the pieces of sandalwood. If you have smaller pieces like I do, skip this step. **

*   **Place the 9 bay leaves into the salt in a circle. Place them going clockwise, to attract your manifestation to you. **

*   **Do the same for the sandalwood pieces, along with the rest of the herbs. **

*   **Feel free to come up with any chants, incantations, etc. for this spell, but it’s not needed. **

*   **Light both candles. Make sure you keep your intention in mind. Visualize the energy of how you feel once you have been casted. **

*   **Let the candles burn down on its own. If you must put out the fire for hazardous reasons, for example, you go to sleep, make sure you try to snuff out the candles, so the spell is “”paused””, then you can re-light them once you are ready. Do not reuse these candles or herbs for other things.**
