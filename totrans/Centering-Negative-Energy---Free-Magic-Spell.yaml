- en: This requires an edit. You can call on the elements for a cleansing, and this
    is a fine start, but you did not cleanse yourself. Are you using the incense?
    Are you taking an herbal bath? Are you grounding yourself? Are you burning cleansing
    herbs as you throw petitions into the fire? This is the beginning and conclusion
    of a spell, it is missing the middle. I would meditate, ground yourself, and visualize
    the four elements wrapping around you and cleansing away any negative energy within
    your aura.
