- en: Make sure you wear something that you wear a lot like a necklace this will store
    the energy.First rub your hands gently together for about 5 seconds then keep
    your hands together, your hands must look like you are praying, then kiss your
    index fingers wile hands are still together your thumb nails must touch round
    about the middle of your chin then hold your hands over the object and close our
    eyes.Imagine that the energy from the object is being sucked up into your hands
    you will know if you are doing right when your hands fell like they been dipped
    in ice cold water.Then hold your hand over the object you wear a lot close your
    eyes and imagine the energy going into the object you will fell the same coldness
    if you did it right.There you have free or emergency energy anywhere you are.
