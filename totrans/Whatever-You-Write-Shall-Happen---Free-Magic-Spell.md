I have a question,how do I use it do I just write what I want without details or is there a specific way to use this

I have to tell you this, hate to break it to you, but I tried this and it didn't work. Sorry for the inconvenience.

The spell will work if you have enough patience and will power. If you doubt the power of magic it is hard to use, but if believe with every fiber of your being that it will work then you will see results.

I've used this spell so many times, it's takes a while for it work. But I can reassure you it dose work. Just be patient.

you cant do the impossible per se because magick is a natural energy and can not change you into a different being.

How long does it take? Like few days for it to happen? I am not sure if I write a date and what was I doing I'm not sure if I am gonna be back at that time of day if I wrote it in book cause there are few mistakes I did and wanted to start over a love life.

so i need thyme.. i wish teleportation worked

reading over this, the chant promising instant and impossible results, it won't happen because that's not how magick works. however, if you write out, say, ''i wish my crush will ask me out'' then say the chant, visualize how it will happen, then take the time to get to know your crush, occasionally reading over what you wrote and saying the chant over, it can work. you're setting your intention and sending out to the universe that you want something tangible to happen, this will set things in motion for you to achieve it. but, if you write ''i want a dinosaur'' or expect it to start raining money after you finish the chant, this won't happen because magick isn't that instant, direct, or impossible.

It will work, because magic is simply the ability to control an alter the energy that makes the universe. If one has the patience and will power, and they believe in magic with every fiber of their being anything and everything can will be possible the only limit, your imagination.

This could work, I once used a chant like this as a sort of wishing envelope. Have not used it yet, but it could work as long as your expectations aren't too wild.

I repeat, this can work if cast correctly, but it won't grant something impossible. You can cast for a million dollars and it will tell the universe this is what you want and through your hard work, you will accumulate a million dollars over, say, a decade. This would be a long-term spell. You cast this so your crush asks you out to prom. You get to know your crush, and they should ask you to prom. You wish for a pet dragon to ride on like in Game of Thrones, that will not happen because it contradicts how magick works on the physical plane [at best, you'll be gifted a toy Dragon]

Well what if the spell's chant was changed to not say instantly or impossible rather matching magic's time then can you say it will work? If so let me know thinking of a new way to rewrite it while keeping the rhyming scheme.

This would work by utilizing the law of attraction in which you detail your deepest desires and tell the universe it will happen, thus charging the energy around you to bring that thing to you. the issue lies in how realistic your desires are. owning your dream home in the south of France or vacationing in Japan might be more attainable than bringing your childhood pet back to life and learning to fly. i suppose i should say no matter how unlikely the odds if it's a natural thing [marry a celebrity, become rich, first person on Mars] then this spell can use the law of attraction to make that a reality [give it time, and you need to put forth some effort] if you are looking for something unnatural [teleprot, time travel, own a living dinosaur] then this spell will never work.

You cannot go back in time to change past events.

So after I write the spell. I write whatever at bottom and suddenly it will come true?

Likely it will not happen.

ive done this and the results of it working are yes and no if its something out landish like i will to tokyo in a week obviously it wont happen but if you write something like i will gain better grades in school and such it could help but when ive used this spell i say this spell for every peice of paper i use to help with it

so if this spell does work and u write something u didnt really mean like death to a person how do u reverse it
