- en: This type of journey is also known as **soul retrieval**, **power retrieval**,
    and **soul healing**.The basic principles of a Shamanic Style Journey are similar
    to those used in many indigenous cultures. It involves connecting with the spiritual
    world to gain insight, clarity, and healing. In order to do this, one must be
    open to the possibility that the spiritual realm exists and is accessible.

- en: The first step in a Shamanic Style Journey is to set an intention. This could
    be a question you want to ask, an answer you want to gain, or an area of your
    life you want to explore. After setting an intention, it is important to create
    a safe space for yourself. This could be a quiet room in your home, a peaceful
    outdoor area, or a special place of your choosing, you can go on shamanic style
    journey by yourself but, let's say you found a circle who is doing one.

    then continue with the preparation of the ritual. The attendees relax on pillows
    or floor and the leader of the ritual starts to drum on a Shamanic Drum {or talk,
    or both}, the sound of the drum induces **state of a trance** in the attendees
    and with their eyes closed, they tend to see visions, meet their spirit guides,
    visit Underworld or the Upperworld and so on, the options are endless.

    This is the time to explore the spiritual realm and ask questions. You may find
    yourself in a place that symbolizes your subconscious mind, or you may encounter
    a spirit guide who can provide guidance and insight. It is important to stay open
    and trust the journey.

    or messages that come to you. These can often provide insight into your life and
    help to answer your questions. Once you have explored the spiritual realm and
    answered your questions, it is important to take time to reflect and integrate
    your experiences.Finally, bring your journey to an end. This can be done by focusing
    on your breath and slowly returning to a state of consciousness.
