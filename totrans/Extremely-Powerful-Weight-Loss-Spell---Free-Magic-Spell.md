*   red ribbon

Set the nine candles up in a circle, with the white and black candles opposite each other. The circle must be big enough for you to sit cross-legged in. Lay a red ribbon on the floor, connecting the white and black candles. Light the candles. With the red pen, write the following on the piece of paper:
I wish to lose weight
wish to lose weight
ish to lose weight
sh to lose weight
h to lose weight
to lose weight
o lose weight
lose weight
ose weight
se weight
e weight
weight
eight
ight
ght
ht
t

Pass the paper through the flames of each of the candles once, burning it, but not setting it on fire. Put the paper in the crystal bowl. Light each end of the ribbon on fire, one with the white candle, one with the black candle. Put the ribbon in the bowl. Once the fire has died down, go outside, and blow the ashes into the wind, imagining yourself losing ten pounds and looking beautiful. Repeat the spell for every extra ten pounds you eant to lose. So, if you want to lose fifty pounds, do the spell five times.

Try it and see. This could work to motivate, but you still need to put in the effort, you won't lose 10 pounds overnight. [also, what was the point of the bleeding heart?] and another thing, while I understand visualizing yourself thinner and all the positives that come with it, beauty shouldn't be one of them. Your beauty isn't tied to your dress size [people who tell you otherwise are toxic] If you don't have a certain level of self-worth before setting off on a weight loss journey, losing the weight won't make you feel better, you'll keep chasing a smaller number. It's a slippery slope. Try the spell before starting a new diet/exercise routine, but don't tie your weight to your worth. [never think ''if I'm this size, people will like me'' it's a very dangerous mindset]

wait a minute, what is the benefit of having ''abracadabra triangle'' on the spell?

This may help with cravings and motivation, but you will not lose ten pounds without any effort.
