- en: When you think of potions, do you think of things like Harry Potter and Charmed?
    If so, that is okay, because that is how most of the world sees potions, but that
    is not the case. You can make a potion out of materials and ingredients you already
    have at home, and the potion can be for consumption or topical use.

  zh: 当你想到魔法饮品，你是否想到《哈利·波特》和《女魔法师》之类的东西？如果是，没问题，这是大部分世界如何看待魔法饮品，但事实并非如此。你可以用家中已有的材料和成分制作魔法饮品，这种魔法饮品可以是可食用的，也可以是局部使用的。

  zh: 那么，我可以把什么变成魔法饮品呢？
- en: My favorite thing to make into a potion is my morning coffee. I work from home,
    and I get up very early in the morning, so my coffee is always the first thing
    I consume every day. The ingredients I use when I make my coffee and the intention
    I set when stirring it both help to direct my energy into the cup. Then I say
    a little chant and move on with my day. If you drink coffee, try the following.
    If you drink anything else in the morning, see if you can come up with your own
    little recipe!

  zh: 我最喜欢变成魔法饮品的事情是早晨的咖啡。我在家工作，每天早上起床得很早，所以每天的第一件事就是喝咖啡。我冲咖啡时使用的配料以及搅拌时设定的意图都有助于将我的能量引导到杯子里。然后我会唱小小的咒语，继续我的一天。如果你喝咖啡，可以试试下面的这个方法。如果你早上喝其他的饮品，看看你是否能想出自己的小配方！
- en: Pour your coffee and add your ingredients. I like to use heavy cream and a bit
    of [cinnamon](https://spells8.com/lessons/cinnamon-herbal-magic/). When stirring
    my drink, I stir clockwise to bring what I want to me. Then, I say something like
    the following.

    Since I work from home, I have a [podcast](http://www.roundthecauldron.com/podcast),
    and I write, I need a constant flow of inspiration. Also, since I work from home,
    procrastination and dawdling are things that follow me everywhere.

  zh: 这个小小的咏唱适合我，因为它很符合我通常的做事情。由于我在家工作，有一个 [播客](http://www.roundthecauldron.com/podcast)，以及我写作，我需要持续的灵感。此外，由于我在家工作，拖延成了无可避免的事情。
- en: Since I am a writer, I have used the words in the above chant very selectively.
    Each one has a purpose, and it serves me well. If you try this out, please do
    not think that you need to have some elaborate chant over your coffee. This is
    how I cast my spells, but you might do it differently. You could even just say
    an affirmation over your coffee and call it good. Whatever works for you!

  zh: 由于我是作家，我精心选择了上面咏唱中的词语。每个词都有其目的，对我很有效。如果你尝试这个，不要认为在你的咖啡上一定要进行复杂的咏唱。这是我施展魔法的方式，但你可能会有不同的方式。你甚至可以在咖啡上说一句肯定的话就好了。对你有效的都可以！

- en: We have talked about making a potion out of something you can consume, but what
    about something you use on your skin? This works, too! If you have a favorite
    lotion or body product, turn it into a potion. If you make your own body products,
    then you have an extra opportunity here. Take your body product - I’ll use lotion
    here as an example - and mix it up a bit. Add ingredients, say a spell, and then
    use it!

  zh: 我们之前说过可以用可以食用的东西制作一个魔法饮品，那用在皮肤上的呢？这也可以！如果你有喜欢的乳液或身体护理产品，可以将其制成魔法饮品。如果你自己制造身体护理产品，那么你就有了额外的机会。拿出你的护理产品
    - 我会以乳液为例 - 再进行一些混合。添加材料，说一句咒语，然后使用它！
- en: Take a lotion that you enjoy. If you do not want to add anything to it, skip
    the next part. If you want to add to it, choose ingredients that work well for
    what you want to do. Do you want to attract love into your life? Maybe add some
    ground rose petals or rose essential oil. Do you want to bring peace and tranquility
    to you? Add some ground [lavender](https://spells8.com/lessons/lavender-herbal-witchcraft/)
    or lavender essential oil. The possibilities with this are endless, but it does
    come with a warning. Some ingredients are poisonous and must be used with caution
    or not used at all. Please do your research before using ingredients that you
    are not familiar with!

- en: If you want to say a chant or spell over your lotion, now is the time to do
    so. You can even create a spell that you say as you use it instead of over the
    lotion itself. Here is an example of a chant using affirmations. When chanting
    affirmations, I like to repeat them as quickly as possible so the words flow together
    and you can no longer make out the words by themselves.

    that is essentially a liquid can be turned into a potion and they do not all have
    to be consumed. You can turn your tea into a potion if you’re studying for a test.
    Had a rough day? Add some herbs to your bath and take a [magickal bath](https://spells8.com/rose-lavender-bath-find-new-love/).
    If you can think of it, it can be done. Do not let your creativity be stifled
    by the thoughts or opinions of others because if it works for you, then that is
    what matters.

    Please be sure that any ingredients you use are safe for you and those around
    you. Some herbs are [harmful to animals](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants).
    Some herbs are [harmful to humans](https://www.britannica.com/list/7-of-the-worlds-deadliest-plants).
    Please take that second of precaution before you use something you aren’t familiar
    with.
