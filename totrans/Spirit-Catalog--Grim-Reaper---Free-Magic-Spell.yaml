  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though it is said to be able to move around in different places our encounters
    have proven otherwise, each country in the world has a different ''Grim Reaper''
    proved by folklore depicting it in many forms, be it Greek, Roman, Japanese, etc.
    They all have forms of the god of death. We have encountered this spirit once
    as it took away an evil soul, it is truly a powerful and almighty spirit, it is
    impossible to seal. Though this spirit is extremely powerful, it is not dangerous
    the Grim Reaper will not disturb you if you do not disturb it, it follows guidelines
    and performs its duties.
