    of what that means, but the latest [surveys dating back to 2008 by Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/religious-denomination/pagan-or-wiccan/)

    and it implied a belief in a false deity. Members of diverse creative organizations

    became the dominant religion in Europe. It was practiced by people who lived in
    rural areas, and they believed that the gods were present all around them.

    cults. It was at this time that the idea of paganism first emerged. As Christianity
    arose from Second Temple Judaism and Hellenistic Judaism, it faced up against
    various pagan monotheistic faiths such as Dionysiac cults.

    in pagan practices. The study of traditional religions sparked questions about
    the origin of religion. Religions started to be interpreted as part of ethnic
    identities.

    polytheists as having a “pagan identity” from birth. It wasn’t something you could
    become or shed off. This “savage” identity was an excuse for much violence against
    these people and lingers to the modern day.
