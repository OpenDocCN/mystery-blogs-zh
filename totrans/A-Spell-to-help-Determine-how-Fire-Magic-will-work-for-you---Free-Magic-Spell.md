Pyrin isn't any sort of being, it is a protein found in the human genome. And Kandor is the capital of Krypton in the Superman comics. Given the inaccurate names that one is to call upon, it is unlikely that this spell is going to do anything that might be considered accurate.

The names are relating to a fictional world, however the spell does work for me. It has told (not actually) me that I have a weak fire magic affinity. True, because I always struggle with fire magic.

How exactly is the affinity made aware to the user?

Since the people you call upon are not actual deities or spiritual beings I doubt this spell works. If you wish to attune with the element of fire you could try meditating by an open flame, a candle or fireplace works, but you can also use a heat lamp or video of a fire. You should also research what fire is associated with and do activists associated with it while reflecting on fire. I have heard some do HIIT training, wearing red, or eating spicy food while reflecting on the fire element, just some examples.
