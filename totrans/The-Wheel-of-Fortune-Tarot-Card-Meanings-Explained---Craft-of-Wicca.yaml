- en: '**The upright Wheel of Fortune tells you that life is in perpetual flux. Good
    fortune and luck will return in due course. If things are going well, be aware
    that this, too, may change and that life may enter a valley. Big changes are on
    the way if the Wheel of Fortune shows upright in your Tarot reading.**'

    moments in your life while they are still within reach – because they might be
    gone in an instant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the change of the seasons, the natural world, and even the supernatural world also
    influence luck and individual fate.

    no matter the outcome, it may not stay long because the wheel always rotates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Wheel of Fortune is also known as the Wheel of Karma.  If you are kind and
    loving to others, they will be nice and caring to you. Be rude and mean, and you’ll
    receive nasty and cruelty in return. So, if you desire love and prosperity, make
    sure you’re putting out positive energy in return. What you put into the Cosmos
    will be returned to you.

    Tarot card indicates that circumstances beyond your hands are impacting your position.

- en: It’s as if the Universe is serving up anything it wants; it’s unpredictable
    and unsettling. This is one of the more difficult components of the Wheel of Fortune
    because regardless of which direction the Wheel spins, it is impossible to modify
    it. Learn to accept what is happening.

    our hands. Unlike the traditional card with gods playing around and influencing
    things, this shows that luck, success, failure, personalities, and so on are all
    naturally determined.

    this card appears. We must learn to accept our fate with grace and humility. We
    may not be able to improve our luck, but we can improve how we react to it.
