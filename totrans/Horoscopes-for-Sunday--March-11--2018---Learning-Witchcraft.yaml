- en: There is little doubt that you will get what you want over the coming year,
    but how you get it will determine the quality of your success. Be direct, be dynamic
    and be determined but be respectful of other people too. For best results, work
    with them.

- en: No matter how confused and chaotic events may be you remain the personification
    of calm – nothing, but nothing, ruffles your feathers. Others can run around like
    headless chickens if they want today but you will float serenely above the cares
    of the world.

- en: Now is the time to get started on those changes you have been thinking about
    for weeks, months, maybe even years. With the Sun in your sign linked to Pluto,
    planet of power, you can and you must make the most of your talents. It’s now
    or never Pisces!

- en: Some of the thoughts running through your head at the moment are pretty explosive.
    So long as they stay in your head no harm will be done, but if you try to apply
    them there is no telling what might happen. Remember, causes always have consequences.

    today or during the early part of next week. Don’t let your doubts about other
    people’s motives hold you back. Act fast and make what you have dreamed of a reality.

    can find a way to combine the two this could be a hugely profitable time for you.
    Just be careful your workload does not get so heavy that you find it hard to cope.

    will take a lot to deny you what it is you desire. Don’t wait for it to come to
    you though – get out there and claim it for your own. Possession is nine-tenths
    of the law.

    is no reason for you to ignore it either. Yes, it may be a bit embarrassing but
    you have a big enough personality to take it in your stride. Learn to laugh at
    yourself.

    What you think are the facts may actually be closer to fiction, so check what
    you are told by other people, and by the promptings of your own mind.

- en: At last you are beginning to make sense of some of the things that have been
    happening in your life in recent months. Now that you can see there is a pattern
    to events you should feel less anxious about the future. It’s all part of the
    plan.

- en: Pluto, your ruler, is on fine form at the moment, making you feel energized
    and dynamic. You are also determined to do something worthwhile. There are enough
    trivial things and trivial people in the world already, so be sensible, be serious
    and be a success.

    whole world disagrees with you but you can and you must do what your inner voice
    tells you. Don’t listen to the so-called experts – YOU are the expert in your
    life.

    in several months. Pluto in your sign makes you ultra forceful – you simply won’t
    take no for an answer either at home or at work. Be forceful, but don’t be fanatical.
