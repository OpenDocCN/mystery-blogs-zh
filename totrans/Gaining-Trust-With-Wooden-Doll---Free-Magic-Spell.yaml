    you should first draw the shape of a man/woman on the piece of wood with a marker
    and then paint it with blue dye. After that you should also draw brows, eyes,
    nose, ears and mouth on the man/woman on the wood.

    but you should omit the facial features. After that, cut the wood into 4 pieces
    while saying: "give me your trust!"'

    is the 2D flatboard image of the dill to be cut out of the wood? And when you
    say cut in four how are these cuts to be made? Like cut four times or cut off
    each limb?
