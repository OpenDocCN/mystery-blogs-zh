    to your problem to decorate your altar with. For example, if there is a problem
    at your office, then Friday would be a good day for doing the spell and a suitable
    theme would be green. The magic can all be strengthened by a tourmaline crystal
    (with magical properties of protection, business, prosperity and friendship),
    nasturtium (if you are struggle,no matter how hard you work), twigs or birch leaves
    (if you want to plan a new beginning). Also lay your favorite talismans and charms
    on the altar and burn some essential oil in your oil burner.

    you own everyday words. There is no reason to feel self-conscious. No one will
    be eavesdropping. The way ahead should slowly form itself. When your magic making
    concludes, remember these words from an ancient Chinese proverb which states:'
