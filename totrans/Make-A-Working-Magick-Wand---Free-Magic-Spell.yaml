    twig, or an intricately craved and decorated magickal tool how your wand looks
    entirely depends on your own practice and taste.

    a couple of months ago I have been able to put it in difrint parts of my body.
    But my only question is why does it come from below my heart, I feel it's intense
    flames a lot, if any one has an answer please let me know.

    ranging from a breeze to a strong wind will come by during the spell. Occasionally
    when I release a spell indoors AC will go off as soon as I release the spell (this
    most often happens when I make a Psi ball and release it to practice energy flow).

    a few months ago. She says that no spell is going to work if I don't ''sign off''
    to at least one god/goddess. Is that actually true?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don't have to involve deity in your craft at all! There are traditions that
    would require deity or spirits to be involved, but there are also witches who
    don't honor or even believe in deities. If that doesn't work for you there's nothing
    wrong with not working with a god/dess.

    cold. Then I went to the great sycamore in our yard, a tree with nearly 6 feet
    of width, and it's bark was warm despite the icy sleet. I walked to one kg the
    low hanging branches, and saw one thick stick near a foot long just in my reach.
    I expected it to be a struggle to pull down, but it fell right into my hands.
    It most definitely worked.

- en: Wands can be made from anything. The material would have special properties
    giving the wand unique energies. It doesn't have to be oak or maple, it could
    be made of metal, crystals, plastic, or whatever. So long as you feel connected
    to it, it works.

- en: Yes and no. Skipping through the woods going ''Magic weee'' does not do anything.
    Approach a tree, introduce yourself and ask if you can use a branch. Connect with
    the trees energy. Meditate by the tree, if you place your hand on the tree, you
    should feel the energy pulsing. Warm or cold could be the energy, but more likely
    its dependent on the weather and the sun on the tree. If you get a yes, thank
    the tree and leave an offering. The branch should be the length of your arm, from
    your elbow to the tip of your middle finger, because you will shape and design
    your wand and it will be worked down. When you have your wand, bless and dedicate
    it (see different spell). Purchasing a wand is also fine, but treat it the same
    way you connected with the tree. Sense the Magik and choose the one you are drawn
    to, not the first one or the prettiest one. It is annoying to say, but you will
    know when you see it.

    it through my body and out my hands and it start raining then lightning struck
    the tree I was next to and it lit on fire so I used my wand to stop the spell
    and it started raining harder I got scared and lost control and the lightning
    started striking the ground in random spot what element and I

- en: What a strange dream. You are every element. You may find yourself with an affinity
    to one or another, or more than one. But you possess qualities of all of the elements
    symbolically represented in magical traditions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like prsona said, we're all the elements and through our craft, we learn to
    balance these energies. Since you didn't state if this was a dream or not, I would
    caution you against roleplaying because it's against site rules. [also, you claimed
    in the first line to not have a wand, then contradicted yourself in the third
    line by claiming you had a wand] If this was a dream, I'd say it's a fear of losing
    control or being unable to control your magick. Fire and lightning are symbols
    of uncontrollable anger and sudden changes in one's life and a tree is usually
    a spiritual awakening. So, this could be a situation in which you lost your temper,
    but it seems more likely you're growing in the craft and you're afraid you'll
    do harm. I'd meditate and journal about your fears to try and come to terms with
    them.
