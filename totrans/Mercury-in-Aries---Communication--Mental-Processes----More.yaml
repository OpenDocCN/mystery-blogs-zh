- en: Mercury is the planet that rules the mind, thought processes, and communication
    style in Astrology.  It tells us not what we think about, but how we think. Mercury
    is the closest planet to the sun, and moves the fastest. It may be difficult to
    differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is the persona, and Mercury
    is the mind.

- en: Mercury in Aries people have a very one-track mind when it comes to their thought
    processes. They cannot multitask– they do one thing at a time, and move onto the
    next. These people are lively, energetic, and outgoing. They appear to need constant
    stimulation and are almost always *doing something. *
  prefs: []

    by Mars, Mercury in Aries people have the ability to use martian ambition to see
    their thoughts become a reality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mercury in Aries people are very quick thinkers. They are courageous and ambitious,
    although they sometimes may lack a bit of common sense. These people may have
    an idea and run with it, without fully thinking through if it is actually what
    they want. Mercury in Aries individuals tend to be a little impulsive about decisions.
    They rarely thinks things through completely.
  prefs: []

    on or think about. Other people cease to exist in their minds, almost as if their
    problems are the only ones in the world that matter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aries in Mercury people have a very self-oriented mind. They often think more
    about what is happening in their own life than in others. This is not a bad thing,
    and gives them a lot of room for realizing their dreams, because they are not
    as caught up worrying about other people and what they are doing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To Mercury in Aries people, they assume this is how all people are. If something
    is preoccupying their mind, they are incapable of setting it aside to deal with
    something else. They have a hard time mentally processing their emotions and issues,
    because when these issues arise, they are the only thing in the world that exists.
    All the good in the world falls away.

    new idea or life is going well, or they are 100% pessimistic. They are a mind
    of extremes, and have a hard time balancing things.
  prefs: []

- en: When they develop an opinion, to them anything else becomes immediately wrong.
    They cannot understand why anyone would think that way. It can be incredibly hard
    for them to empathize with other people, because they simply would not do things
    the same way.

    away from a challenge. They see life as a new challenge every day, and are in
    a constant state of winning or losing.
  prefs: []

    a high. My advise to them is to look for balance. They should be looking for the
    other side of the coin on every thought they have.

- en: Mercury in Aries individuals are either the best or the worst at communicating
    with people. On a good day, when things are sailing smoothly in their own personal
    lives, Mercury in Aries individuals give you 100% of their time and energy, and
    are completely present in the moment. When they’re struggling, however, they rarely
    listen to other people.

    Their energy is very directed, and if the conversation is going one way, they
    do not like when it veers off onto another kind of conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to talk to someone, they are doing so with *intention*, and only want to discuss
    the things they want to discuss.
  prefs: []

- en: Mercury in Aries people are incredibly bad liars. They are too bold and direct
    with how they feel, and they rarely ever have to lie. Sometimes this boldness
    may get them into some hot water– in which case, they may tell a white lie to
    get out of it. This lie will come across almost immediately as being forced or
    fake by the receiver.

- en: The Mercury in Aries woman is bold, assertive, and direct. Her thoughts become
    her words, and she is not afraid to say what she means. Because her mind is ruled
    by mars, she will come across has having a more masculine thought process, even
    if this is not the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    friendships or brothers. Her mindset was likely formed and developed from her
    relationship with her father figure, or other men in her life.

    for people to guess what she is thinking, and she has no expectations that she
    does not lay down beforehand. She is smart and captivating, brilliant and fiery,
    and her mind works much faster than her words can even describe.
  prefs: []

- en: The Mercury in Aries woman is the kind of woman who will tell you to your face
    that you are not what she is looking for. She will fire you for doing your work
    poorly and insufficiently. The Mercury in Aries woman may be picky, because she
    knows no one can compare to her own mental strength, and this may make her discerning
    when it comes to falling in love.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She is witty, charismatic, and outgoing. One of the things the Mercury in Aries
    woman tens to lack is charm and nuance. When she wants something, she will be
    direct and to the point– there is no fluff or go-around with her, which makes
    flirting with a Mercury in Aries woman a bit difficult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What she lacks in charm and nuance she makes up for in her bold assertiveness.
    She is not someone who needs to be “looked after.” If you are looking for a strong
    and independent woman who don’t need no man, Mercury in Aries is probably going
    to be the woman for you.

- en: The Mercury in Aries Man is impulsive and unpredictable. He *does* what he wants,
    rather than *saying *what he wants. He figures people will get what he means from
    his actions, and lives very much by “actions speak louder than words.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this kind of attitude is not exactly passive, the Mercury in Aries man
    would rather avoid aggressive or outright communication when it can be avoided.
    When choosing between a honest conversation and ghosting, this man will certainly
    choose ghosting.
  prefs: []

    in his hobbies and profession(s). He likely always has more than one occupation/source
    of income happening at a time, and he is very driven in every single one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mercury in Aries man is very hard energy to match. He is so independent
    and strong on his own that he makes it known to the world that he does not, nor
    will he ever, need any opinion outside of his own. If he asks a close friend for
    an opinion, it is not because he *wants advise*, it is rather because he needs
    to vent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mercury in Aries man gets his emotions out through putting them into physical
    form. When something happens in his life, it is all he can talk about, and he *has*
    to talk about it in order to process it in his mind. Because of this, he likely
    has very close friends or a partner that he can count on. This makes him dependent
    on someone (whether he likes to admit it or not).
