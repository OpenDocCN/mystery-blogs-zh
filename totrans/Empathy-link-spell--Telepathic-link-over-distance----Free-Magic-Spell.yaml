- en: This will give you a Telepathic connection to someone else who will be able
    to hear you over a great distance and this is a dangerous spell because if one
    of you dies then the other will most likely die as well. It's also gonna be like
    the Empathy link from the Percy Jackson series.

    so mote it be." Next say this as many times as you want " Oh great goddess Athena
    I invoke you to give me an Empathy link like the ones in the Percy Jackson series
    with the person that I choose (first and last name) if one of us dies then the
    other person will most likely die too please let this happen for this is my will
    so mote it be."

- en: This will not work as telepathy of the sort you are describing isn't real. Sounds
    like maybe you are basing this on the Percy Jackson books which are strictly fantasy.
    It won't work, no one will die.
