# Fire and Water Wish Spell - Free Magic Spell

> 来源：[https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/weather_spells/fire_spells/26672/page.html#0001-01-01](https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/weather_spells/fire_spells/26672/page.html#0001-01-01)

 **Please note: **The burned hair will give off a strong smell. The tea tree oil helps a bit, but if you live with someone or are still a closet-witch, this spell may not be for you. Also, please be careful when burning things. Put your hair back and be safe!

**Steps:**

On the small paper or leaf (I used a paper about 1-inch x 1-inch in size), write down your wish. In my example, I wrote:

"I have a job interview."

Write it down as if it already happened!

Fold the paper (preferably three times, but any amount is OK). Then, take several strands (note: hair that has already fallen out. For example, I used a bulk of hair from my hairbrush) and wrap it around the paper.

Next (**and Be Careful!)** burn the hair and the paper (or leaf) in the fire-safe bowl. You can use incense to help burn it, too, a match, etc. 

Add a drop or couple drops of oil. Be careful, as this will make the fire burn higher/stronger. 

When it burns enough (follow your instincts), pour a small amount of water (approx a cup or less).

Add a pinch or two of ashes.

Add flower petals, soil, etc you want to add (optional).

Add some candle wax to "seal". I used a black candle, but you can use any candle or a color associated with your wish. For example, if your wish is related to money, you can use a green candle. 

Stir by moving the bowl around, chanting your wish several times.

When you are done, pour it on the ground outside. For me, I did this right outside my bedroom window.

Important factors to consider:

1\. Make sure that you are still doing things to help with the spell. For example, if your wish is to have a job interview, apply to jobs! If your wish is for your crush to notice you, wear a nice outfit! If your wish is to get stronger physically, work out.

2\. Keep doing the spell until you get the desired results.

My results:

I did this spell about four nights in a row until I got a job interview at the company I wanted! At first, I kept getting job interviews after job interviews at places that turned out to be a wrong fit or farther than I expected. If you don't get your desired results, keep trying! For me, that meant I had to keep applying to jobs and keep spell-casting, even when I was REALLY tired of the smell of burned hair. 

However, the spell works amazing for me, so I kept doing it!

Want to add an extra boost?

Throughout the day, keep repeating your wish. For example, I would repeat the words, "I have a job interview" quietly no matter where I was, throughout the day. 

Sometimes, I would light a candle, say it, then blow it out.

Persistence is key!
