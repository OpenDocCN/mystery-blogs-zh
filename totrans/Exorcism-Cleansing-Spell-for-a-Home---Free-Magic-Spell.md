**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Large Bowl of Salt

*   White Candle

*   Large Fireproof Bowl

*   1 tablespoon powdered garlic

*   1 tablespoon peppermint

*   1 tablespoon ground clove

*   1 tablespoon dried/powdered thistle

*   A handful or two of sweetgrass

*   Sage or dried oak leaves

Take the large bowl of salt and sprinkle a pinch or two over the exterior doorways and windowsills of your home. Make certain you get each and every one.

Choose the room that has the strongest negative feel to it. Light a white candle. In a large fireproof bowl combine all the herbs.

Carefully light the mixture so that it smolders, giving off an aromatic smoke. Leaving the candle lit, carry the bowl in to each room and repeat the following:

''In the name of the Eternal Lady and Lord I bid thee part.

I consecrate and clear this space.

Let nothing but joy linger here.''

When you have done each room, return to the first, set the bowl beside the candle and wait for the remaining mixture to burn out.

Take the ash outside and sprinkle it over the grass/flowerbed/etc, thereby returning it to the Mother.

I would not consider this an exorcism, but it has potential as a cleansing. I would use different herbs. Especially sage and sweetgrass. Do your research surrounding these herbs as white sage and braided sweetgrass are part of close practices. This is not to say the magick police will break down your door if you use it, I am saying you might consider other alternatives or purchasing from a local indigenous supplier.
