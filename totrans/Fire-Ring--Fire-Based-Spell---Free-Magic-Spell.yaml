- en: 1\. Create a ball of fire, grab it between your two hands or your mind (which
    many strong wizards decide to do), and twist it like a rag and little ashes like
    water droplets will hit the ground.

- en: 2\. After about the 10th water droplet that hits the ground, take the very thin
    twirled fire string, (Can be used as whip but several more steps can transform
    it to be stronger and more sturdy), bend it with your mind (envision it) and now
    you have a ring. You must be careful with what you envision because it could be
    dangerous.

    than with your mind. It also goes away once used. There are many other fire rings
    which more experienced wizards can use, but if you are a beginner, I recommend
    sticking with this one. If you insist, in the future, I will create another fire
    ring under the title: Fire Ring:Fire based spell-Expert'

- en: 4\. Two ways you can deflect a fire ring spiraling towards you, (to do this,
    just bend it using your hands as a guide), is using another fire ring to deflect
    it, and maybe even attack your opponent at the same time if you use blue fire.
    (Search up blue fire and use the same precautions in making a fire ball and ring).
    Secondly, you could jump through the ring by using a water skin spell and tackle/attack
    your opponent, all the while, extinguishing the fire ring. If the second attack
    is used on you, have a wind gush or another air spell prepared to block their
    tackle or water attack.

    cannot create a ring of fire through will.

    both of those, this isn't a real spell nor any form of real magic.
