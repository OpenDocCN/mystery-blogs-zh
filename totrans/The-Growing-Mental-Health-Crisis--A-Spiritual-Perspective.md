*In this newest Episode of “Psychic Chat” we will discuss the growing mental health crisis that our society is currently facing. We will explore the spiritual reasons behind the surge in mental health issues and provide unique insights into the root causes of this widespread problem.*

As we drift further away from our spiritual selves and our connection to nature, we often lose touch with the inner compass that guides us. This disconnection can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and a wide range of mental health issues.

> We will talk about the why's and how's of the current state of things and possible energetic solutions and easy steps we can all take to enhance our well being, that go beyond simple meditation recommendations.

*We have a whole self-paced video course that will teach you fundamentals of energetic protection, cord-cutting and self-defense.*
