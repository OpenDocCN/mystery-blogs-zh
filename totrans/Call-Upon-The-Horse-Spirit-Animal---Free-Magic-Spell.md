# Call Upon The Horse Spirit Animal

Spirit animals are the epitome of their own species. Like a totem, they represent their species and are not specific animals who have lived before. The horse can help you to be more independent and confident in yourself, to love yourself, and to stay true to yourself.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Call Upon The Horse Spirit Animal'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   - 1 Candle (Optional) Can be any color, preferably white or red.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   - 1 Candle (Optional) Can be any color, preferably white or red.

*   - Your voice (Or you can just think)

1\. Light your candle if you decided to use one. Set it next to you or in front of you. If you don't have a candle, that's fine. It doesn't matter where you are, it's best to do this in a quiet area, like your room.

2\. Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Keep doing this until you are fully relaxed. After you are calm, you can open your eyes or keep them closed. In your mind, imagine what the horse spirit animal might look like. Imagine it approaching you slowly, a light fog and shining stars surrounding it with a soft white or yellow glow around the spirit.

3\. Say this out loud or in your thoughts, it doesn't matter which.
''Spirit animal of the Horse, please guide, protect, and teach me your ways, help me to be more confident in myself, and to not be afraid to be independent. Watch over me as I face my problems and decisions.
Thank you''

I feel this outline is incomplete. Are you suppose to meditate after the chant? Give an offering? Bless a horse shaped charm to use to symbolize them in future rituals? If you simply walk away, what happens to the energy you have raised in the process of the ritual? You need to ground yourself and the energy in the room. I would also cast a circle since you are preforming a ritual, but that is a personal choice.
