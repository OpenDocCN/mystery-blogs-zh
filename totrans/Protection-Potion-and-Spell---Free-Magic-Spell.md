 Fill up any sink 3/4 the way full with warm water. Add in the 2 tea bags and the coffee. allow to steep until water is darkened. then remove them they wont be needed. If you have a lemon cut it in half and put it in or shake in some lemon juice

Put in all of the spices and herbs above, if you have it fresh it will work the same. Cut your orange and carrots in half and add them in along with the pecans. Your mixture might not look tasty but it should smell good.

Put in the item or items you would like to enchant and begin to slowly stir the mixture. While you are stirring say this spell and you don't have to memorize it:

"A bay leaf for protection,
Celery for psychic ability,
Thyme for attracting loyalty
Parsley for calmness and protecting thy home,
Garlic for healing and protection,
Lemon for cleansing,
Cloves for banishing the hostile,
Sesame for money,
Dill for luck,
Carrots for lust,
Orange for abundance of happiness,
Orange peel for love,
Tarragon for healing,
Pecans for employment and success,
Oregano for strength,
Coffee for anti-negativity,
Paprika for adding energy to a spell,
Chamomile for love and healing"

Stop stirring the mixture and reach in and find your item/s but do not pull them out hold them in your hand and repeat the spell. You shall know whether or not it worked, because you will feel the energy radiating off of the mixture and the room itself. Take the object out and dry it. you will have more energy.
