    items for this spell:** On a bright, sunny day, hold a small mirror in the palm
    of your hand, tilted to catch direct the sunlight. Maintain this position for
    no more than a few seconds. Nine seconds is the maximum. That''s it and the mirror
    is charged. The sun is so powerful that nine seconds is all it takes, and half
    of that is probably more than sufficient.'

    for another purpose, it must be cleansed, reconsecrated, and the ritual repeated.
    If done incorrectly, it can have tragic consequences.
