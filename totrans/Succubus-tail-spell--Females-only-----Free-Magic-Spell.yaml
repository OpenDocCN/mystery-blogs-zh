    your bed, and begin to squeeze your breasts. While continuing to squeeze your
    breasts, chant the following 5 times: "Succubus, succubus, lend me a tail. I do
    not care if I fail. I want the love, I want the lust. A succubus tail, get one
    I must!" If you cannot handle chanting this while squeezing your breasts, you
    must remain calm and focus. Continue to squeeze your breasts for 5 minutes after,
    but do not stop. In several months, you will have a succubus'' tail. Be careful,
    as you may find your lover far more irresistible than they already were, and may
    lose control of your actions temporarily.'

    will grow a tail.

    and they have always worked.
  prefs: []

    The people saying this is fake aren't saying magick isn't real, they're saying
    this spell isn't.

- en: Okay guys- you might not believe me but it works but not in the way you think
    it would work. I am not growing a tail or something but what happens is true-
    it will only happen spiritually btw- this spell slightly scares me now and i dont
    know how to reverse it. I dont want my sin to be lust. (And remember it does no
    physical changes)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You grew a spiritual tail? I'll go out on a limb and say you did [because physically
    it will never happen, astrally people claim anything] you want to undo the tail,
    I don't know how, a cleansing might help, but if you're stuck with a spiritual/astral
    tail use it as a reminder to think before casting and be careful what you wish
    for
  prefs: []

- en: Well I'm pretty sure you should of thought about that, now all you will know
    is lust, just humanity, to sin is death, that is your penalty, just like humanity
    to follow after Sin, they are always wrathful, full of sloth, and are to lazy
    to acheive anything on their own, they are always greedy and gluttonous for power,
    they envy what other people have(even tho what they have is plentiful), and they
    are full of lust, and prideful not so much, if they had any honor or pride they
    wouldn't follow after Sin, and the reason I'm talking as if I'm not human, is
    because if this is what it means to be human, then I reject being a part of humanity

    that ends in k it may not help, as its offensive in the way i use magic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is not rhe all undoer spell, but a safe one if you ise the k. Well safe
    as in it likely wont harm you for it. Spell: Focus on the tail, and traits more
    desirable, but destinctly like yourself. For example, you are timid and resourceful,
    so you may go/think fox. Youll find you can move the tail where you could not
    before and if going by the example it became a foxes. As you said about not wanting
    the sin of lust, youll find you cannot move the tail as was not yours. Once you
    have the tail of what is like you, be honest on trait similarity ot it will fail
    simply will it away, as it was yours it will fade. There you go there if needed.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hypothetically, if this gave you an astral tail, there wouldn't be any physical
    side effects. You may feel something similar to sensing energy [like when someone
    loses a limb they have phantom sensations as if the limb was there] but there
    wouldn't be anything like pain or randomly knocking things off shelves when you
    turn. In the astral, you would be able to feel/use the tail as it would be part
    of your astral form.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    which is what a lot of people like to think for some reason.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because those of us educating members on Real Magik know what is and is not
    possible. On the physical, Magik is a force of nature and does not defy nature.
    You cannot grow a physical tail.

- en: As everyone above has explained, when you know how magick works on the physical,
    you don't need to try out every spell. You can read it over and decipher if a
    spell works or not. We are trying to impart our knowledge onto new members so
    they don't waste their time on fake spells. However, nobody is going to stop you
    from trying it. We're just witches with more experience explaining why a spell
    won't work. If you want to ignore us and try a spell, go for it. [provided the
    spell isn't harmful like ''drink this poison and learn to fly'' then I'd say don't
    try it, but if its ''say this phrase and become a were-rabbit vampire with sparking
    wings and a Dragon tail'' fine. That should only hurt your ego]
