**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Waxing crescent

*   Incense or candle(Optional)

Look at the moon's reflection in the water. Light the candle/incense if you want to. Put your hands into the water where the moon's reflection is. Scoop up some water with your palms and wash your face with it. Chant:
''I will find my special gift and use it with good care.'' three times.
Now sit beside the river/stream/etc and clear your mind of unnecessary thoughts for at least five minutes. This is a little like meditating.

I nick mastrocola and I did the routine of this spell and I just remember this spell for now I will say this in my head

This might work for some, but you do not have special abilities locked away that need be awakened. True, some have talents they have yet to discover, and others might need practice strengthening natural talents, but there is no spell that will unlock some ancient ability buried deep within. Furthermore, sitting quietly and letting thoughts flow by is meditation.
