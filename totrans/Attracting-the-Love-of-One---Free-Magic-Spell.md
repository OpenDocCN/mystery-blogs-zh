**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Cauldron (Something like that)

*   Fire

*   Paper 3x3 inches

*   Something red to draw with

 At nighttime light a small fire in a cauldron or what ever you have available to contain the fire. Cut out a piece of paper that is 3 inches by 3 inches. Draw a heart on it and color it in with red. Write the name of the name of the person that you desire on the heart. While doing all this be thinking of this person being attracted to you and not being able to resist you! Think of his or her heart burning with desire for you just like the flames of the fire. Then kiss the name on the heart 3 times. Place the paper in the fire while saying these words 3 times. Do so with sincerity...

***Fire come from below, bring me love that I do know,
Make my heart blaze and shine, to bring the love that will be mine!
Soon my love will come a day, three times strong and here to stay!
SO MOTE IT BE!*** 

Stay and meditate on the spell you just did, seeing it come true! After you are finished concentrating for a few minutes, extinguish the fire. Soon your love will come to you! **From - Phantom120**
