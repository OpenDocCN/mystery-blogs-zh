**Three Red Leaves Spell**
This spell is used to protect the mind against things such as nightmares, negative thoughts and invasions of evil. First you must gather three red leaves from any tree, plant or bush. Lay them in a triangle on a flat surface. In the centre of the leaves, place an already lighted candle, and place a few drops of chrysanthemum oil on each leaf.

Say this incantation three times:
"Red leaves, gift from earth,
Birth to death and death to birth,
Keep all evil far away,
Day to night and night to day."

Then extinguish the candle, and wrap the leaves in a white cloth or pouch. Place this near your bed within three feet of your head and it will stop all nightmares and negative thoughts.
