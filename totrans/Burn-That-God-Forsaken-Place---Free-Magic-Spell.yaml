    write the name/address on the other. Then meditate and clear mind for about 10
    minutes, then imagine that place on fire. Smell the ash. Feel the blisturing heat
    almost as if it senders your own skin. Make a mental note of the pain you feel,
    now open your eyes. Assemble the sticks in your cauldron and use the match or
    lighter to set them on fire. Chant with a strong commanding voice.... ''

    property is a crime.

    by your own rules, anything is possible. Not saying it would work in this level
    of reality or in the exact manner the spell intends, of course.

- en: A crime is literally something punishable by law, so whether you live by your
    own rules or not, it's still a crime, Nyarlath. (Also, it kind of sounds like
    you're saying arson is okay? I'm not saying you are, I'm just pointing out that
    your comment could come across that way.)
