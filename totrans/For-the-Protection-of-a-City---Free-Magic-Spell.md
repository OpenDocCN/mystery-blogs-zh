# For the Protection of a City

A spell for the protection of a town or city.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Money

*   Bread (unleavened)

*   Oak bark

*   Lavender

*   Rock salt

## Casting Instructions for 'For the Protection of a City'

 To begin with, you must remain pure for eight days, starting from sunrise on the first day to sunrise on the eighth. During this time, you must eat only unleavened bread and drink only water. You must neither have sexual intercourse nor masturbate. You must steal nothing, slander no-one, and injure no-one.

On the eighth day, take a large amount of money and walk through your town or city. When you meet a homeless man or woman, give them some money - enough for a large meal. Do not tell them your name, nor an alias, nor where you live. When you are done, leave them and silently pray for their wellbeing; I will not tell you what to pray.

Repeat this a minimum of eight times, giving money to no less than eight destitute people before sunset. When this is done, return home.

There, crush together oak bark, lavender, and rock salt into one mixture and ignite it. When this is done, say "Beneath thy holy shield we all are safe, O Adonai, O Yeshua Meshiach, against all tempests and all enemies. No fire, no weapon, no plague shall touch us. We are under thy protection, forever and ever. Amen."

With this, the operation shall be complete. No plague shall touch your town, nor shall any enemy raze it, nor shall dread storms bring it to ruin.

**Additional Notes**:

*   I will leave it up to the practitioner how much money is necessary. I could not possibly give an estimation.
*   Be charitable, but give only to those who need it. Many lie in wait, eager to take your money, while many others are in genuine need. Do not give to those who do not need it, lest you cause them to sin. Be wise and observant, yet also be generous. Quoth the Didache, "Let your alms sweat in your hands, until you have discerned to whom you will give."
*   It is exceptionally important that you tell no-one you are performing this spell. Do not tell your friends, family members, fellow practitioners of magic, nor anyone else. You must also keep your giving a secret, telling no-one that you gave or plan to give money. "But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly." (Matthew 6:3-4)
*   Salt symbolizes preservation.
*   Lavender symbolizes peace.
*   Oak is associated with Jupiter, Zeus, and Thor.
*   The number eight is associated with Mercury.
