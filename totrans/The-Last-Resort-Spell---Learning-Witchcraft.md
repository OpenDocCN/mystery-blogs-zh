If none of the spells you have tried have worked, there is a last resort spell that you can try. This spell must be cast on a Friday which is the day most strongly associated with Venus as you will be drawing on her power. To add potency to the spell, you should cast this when Libra and Taurus are in ascent.

**What You Need**

You will need a fresh piece of paper and an unused pen. You also need to have Cardamom essential oil, a crystal of malachite and green leaves if you are casting during Taurus. Pink and royal blue flowers will be needed for casting during Libra and you will need a pair of scissors.

**The Spell**

On the paper, you will need to write your first name and the first name of your jaded lover. If you need to stimulate the sexual aspect of your relationship, you need to draw a square around the two names. If you are certain that you want to spend the rest of your life with the person, you need to draw a circle around them. You should then hold the paper in both of your hands, close your eyes and create a clear picture of the person in your mind while saying:

*If it be right, please let things be,*
*As joyous as they used to be,*
*And let it be done, that it harm no one.*

Once the words have been said, you need to cut out the shape you have drawn on the paper. You should then slip the paper under your pillow.
