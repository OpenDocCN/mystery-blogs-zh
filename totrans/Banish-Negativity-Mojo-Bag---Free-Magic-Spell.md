 Gather items where you do your spell work. Light the incense and black candle.
Light the smudge stick with the black candle. You may make a circle with the smoke if you like.
Hold the black bag in one hand with the smudge in the other, circle the bag with the smudge three times. Let the bag absorb the smoke from the incense and some of the heat off the candle. CAREFUL! NOT TOO CLOSE. Repeat with the shell and the onyx.
Place herbs in the bag along with the shell and onyx. Anoint the bag after you close it. Feed the bag with your energy. When ready, say:

**"I give these items power,
darkness will cower,
With this bag negative thought and energy repel,
Banish it all with this spell."**

Leave the bag near or under the incense until it goes out. Place the bag anywhere you like. All items are optional and you may make substitutions.

Mojo bags are part of Hoodoo, so I would tread lightly, but smudging is a closed practice. However, the items used are not exclusive to Hoodoo, so you can alter this. This would be a protection satchel. If you use a cleansing bundle instead of smudging, I see no harm in this spell.
