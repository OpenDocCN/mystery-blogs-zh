Cast a circle. Light a black candle and burn myrrh incense. Sprinkle the poppet with salt water, saying:

Blessed be, thou creature made of art.
By art made, by art changed.
Thou art not cloth (or wax, whatever it is made out of)
But flesh and blood.
I name thee ___________ (person being bound)
Thou art s/he, between the worlds, in all the worlds,
So mote it be.
Hold the poppet and imagine it enmeshed in a silver net, binding the person in question. Tie the poppet up firmly with red ribbon, binding all parts of it that could possibly do harm. Charge it, saying,

By air and earth,
By water and fire,
So be you bound,
As I desire.
your power is found,
Your power I bind.
By moon and sun,
My will be done.
Sky and sea
Keep harm from me.
Cord go round,
Power be bound,
Light revealed,
Now be sealed.
Earth the power and open the circle. Bury the poppet at the time of the waning moon, far from your home, under a heavy rock.
