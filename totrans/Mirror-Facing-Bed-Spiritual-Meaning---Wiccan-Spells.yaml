    Chinese practice of Feng Shui offers valuable insights. Feng Shui, which translates
    to “wind” and “water,” focuses on the flow of energy or “chi” in our surroundings.
    And one crucial aspect of Feng Shui is the placement of objects and furniture
    in our homes, including mirrors.

    energy flow depending on their placement. Mirrors have the ability to reflect
    and amplify energy, making them ideal for creating a sense of spaciousness and

    and create disharmony in relationships. This belief stems from the idea that when
    we sleep, our body’s energy fields expand and mirror reflections can disturb this
    energy, leading to restlessness and even nightmares. Moreover, according to Feng
    Shui principles, the reflection of a sleeping person in a mirror is believed to
    double the energy, which can lead to feelings of unease and restlessness.

    the quality of the mirror also plays a significant role. It is recommended to
    use high-quality mirrors with clear reflections and avoid mirrors that are broken
    or distorted. Additionally, the shape and size of the mirror can impact the energy
    in a room. Round or oval mirrors are favored in Feng Shui as they are believed
    to promote energy flow, while sharp angles and edges are thought to create negative
    energy or “sha chi.”

    placements that are considered more auspicious. Placing a mirror on the inner
    side of a wardrobe door or inside a closet is believed to redirect the mirror’s
    energy and prevent it from directly facing the bed. Another option is to position
    the mirror in a way that reflects beautiful or calming views, such as a window
    or a piece of artwork.
