    the quality of the mirror also plays a significant role. It is recommended to
    use high-quality mirrors with clear reflections and avoid mirrors that are broken
    or distorted. Additionally, the shape and size of the mirror can impact the energy
    in a room. Round or oval mirrors are favored in Feng Shui as they are believed

    placements that are considered more auspicious. Placing a mirror on the inner
    side of a wardrobe door or inside a closet is believed to redirect the mirror’s
