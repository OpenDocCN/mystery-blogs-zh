    dragon or angel. It's not necessary, and this will still work if you don't have

    If you don't get it when you wake up from your dream, think about it. It might
    take a while to understand because your brain has a weird way of presenting things,
    as well as this spell or ritual.

- en: Since it represents your emotions and you feel you should use more, then go
    for it, but I would try and use three for the top three emotions. You can use
    more, but I don't think it'll enhance the spell. [if anything, I feel it'll add
    more confusion]
