**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**Place the animal you want to ask to be your Familiar on your Alter-if it is too big put it next to or something.
place your hands over the animal and look into its eyes and say...
''By the Moon that shines at night, and the Sun that's very bright, I ask you once, i ask you twice, but more than twice would not be nice... With a Wag, a Croak or Meow, pray tell me now what you will do.
Will you my Familiar be? Give your answer unto Me!''

Wait untill the animal responds, and if you take it as a postive one, then the animal is now your Familiar.

Now you need to name it! your Familiars name must be a secret one.
Again place the animal on you Alter and recite.
''Now i'll give you a New Name, Secret as a Hidden Flame. It's a Secret none shall see; Only we two, you and me. With my hand I make this Spell. Your new name to none i'll tell.
It is ________________!
This is my Will, So Mote It Be!''

Or can i wild animal be used as one's familiar.

A familiar is an animal you have a spiritual connection with [and some don't believe they're physical animals but spirits] you may have a connection with a wild animal but those are usually seen more as a type of animal guide or a passing hint from the universe you might need something [like if you keep seeing chipmunks just hanging around you, it could be saying you need more fun carefree energy in your life and not this chipmunk is your familiar] that said, most familiars are your pet because they are domesticated, calmer around humans, and you can observe and connect with them [again, some believe you can train a pet to help you in ritual like a familiar] as for the effectiveness of this spell specifically I cannot say since I've never cast any spell to find my familiar

Can i try a dragon figurine

Would this work without an alter?

Pets aren't actually able to become familiars, this is a misconception. Familiars are a sort of spirit, not a living, breathing animal. Refer to below link for more information: https://www.spellsofmagic.com/read_post.html?post=857694

Can a dead pet be a familiar?

This is not how you get a familiar. Historically, familiars were demonic creatures which took the form of an animal so they could spy on villagers and report back to the witch they served. Today, familiars are seen as pets you have a special bond with and the pet is able to sense Magik. While some claim you can train pets to be like familiars, a spell will not turn a regular pet into one you have a spiritual link with. I would also like to warn that having a familiar because it sounds cool is the wrong reason. This is a spiritual link. When the pet dies, a part of you is lost with it. It is a worse grief than the normal loss of a pet. You can sense when the animal is in destress and vice versa.
