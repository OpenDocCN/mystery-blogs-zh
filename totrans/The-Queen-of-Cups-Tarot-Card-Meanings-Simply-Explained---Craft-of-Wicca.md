 ## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the Queen of Cups card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

Here is a new interpretation of the Queen of Cups tarot card:

In a modern context, the Queen of Cups can also symbolize the importance of self-care and self-compassion.

 She is a reminder to take care of ourselves emotionally, to be kind to ourselves, and to practice self-compassion. She can also represent the importance of emotional boundaries, and the ability to say “no” to people or situations that are not healthy for us emotionally.

When this card comes up, it can be a reminder to tune in to your emotions, to be kind to yourself, and to make decisions based on your intuition. It can also indicate that you may be in a place of emotional balance and stability and you should trust your feelings and be open to the support of others.

In a reversed position, the Queen of Cups can indicate a struggle with emotional intelligence, which may manifest as difficulty in expressing one’s feelings, difficulty in empathizing with others, or difficulty in taking care of oneself emotionally.

 It can also indicate a disconnection with one’s emotions and intuition, and a lack of self-compassion.
