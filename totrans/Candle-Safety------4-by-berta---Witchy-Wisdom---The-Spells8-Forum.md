“A **glass jar candle** is especially risky to burn to the bottom, because allowing the heat to reach the bottom of the container **could** cause it to crack or explode, in which case the wax will melt out or the wick ( **flame** ) **could** fall out and cause a **fire** !”

**I mistakenly felt that a votive candle in a jar was relatively safe… until last night…**
