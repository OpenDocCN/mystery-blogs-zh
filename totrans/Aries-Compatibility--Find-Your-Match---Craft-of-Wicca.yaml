  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re an Aires if you were born from March 20 to April 21 (varies slightly
    depending on the year).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sign is associated with fire, Mars, and red. Aires tend to be leaders and
    hot-headed. They are energetic and type-A personalities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few ways to approach relationships as an Aires. You can look for
    “opposites attract” or true compatibility. You will want to stay away from other
    fiery people that want to take charge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re probably the type to want to win an argument, and though making up can
    be hot, a partner who also has this quality will lead to long-term incompatibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perfect compatibility will come from a mate that likes cleaning up after the
    fight. You’ll be on to the next project, and so a mate that is detail-oriented
    and cautious will balance the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You tend to lose patience quickly, so you’ll also want a patient mate that knows
    how to soothe you during delays and inactive times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should beware of true opposites, though. You share your love and affection
    freely, so you may not read the signs of someone too introverted or shy if things
    aren’t working for them. True opposites may also find themselves getting jealous.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be cautious of pairing with another Aries. It can work with considerable planning
    and compromise. You’re both passionate and want to dominate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make this work, you’ll need to be willing to submit to your partner’s will
    at times. Admit when you’re wrong and don’t gloat when you’re right.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re both independent. With all your other projects and leadership roles,
    you might find yourself exhausted and resenting your partner for not picking up
    the slack.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can work, but be wary of entering this relationship. Once the passion and
    lust wear off, you might find it to be not worth the effort.
  prefs: []

- en: '## Aries and Taurus'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taurus is going to be stubborn, but this is a good thing. As an Aries, you will
    probably be turned off by too much passivity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the type of passion and competition that can be good for you. As opposed
    to the Aries/Aries pairing, Taurus can rule with you instead of against you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be wary of a Taurus that tries to dominate too much. A good Taurus match will
    stand his ground and keep pace with you without blowing up or taming you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '## Aries and Gemini'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You fall for Geminis and fast. Geminis are fun and entertaining. They keep pace
    with your life, but also provide that much-needed break from your hard work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are, without a doubt, great compatibility. You should pay very close attention
    to the course of the relationship, though. Geminis don’t take things as seriously
    as you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What you perceive as an intense love could be a fling for them. Use your words
    if you want to keep your Gemini around. Make sure you’re on the same page. You
    don’t want to be surprised by a sudden breakup when the next fun thing comes along.

- en: '## Aries and Cancer'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the trickiest pairings for an Aries. Cancer is yielding and loving
    and motherly. It will initially feel like a perfect synergy of passion and tenderness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, that will wear off fast. You have no interest in being protected,
    and the relationship will quickly turn to one in which you feel like you are being
    controlled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This doesn’t have to be the case. So, you must define your boundaries early.
    You also don’t like the drama a Cancer will bring.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Cancer needs to have separate friends as an outlet for these tendencies.
    If you manage this, the pairing can be good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '## Aries and Leo'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Leo is another fire sign. This will be a relationship of hot passion. You’ll
    both be able to do your own things without fear of jealousy or neediness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You do need to be wary of your partner outshining you. It’s just in your nature
    to compare yourself to everyone else. You both want to be the best.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If one of you has success without the other, it could turn into a sour point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But don’t shy away from this pairing. It is one of your best. You’ll be very
    comfortable around each other, and you both understand the other’s motivations
    well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '## Aries and Virgo'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Exercise caution when dating a Virgo. Virgos tend to be pure and prudent. You
    will probably find it hard to get excited about each other sexually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll see someone too shy to be arousing. They’ll find you too outgoing and
    promiscuous. There can be few opposites that attract Virgos for you, but this
    will be an exception.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Outside of the bed, this is one of the better matches. Virgo has the patience
    and internal calm to deal with your more explosive moments. Virgo lovingly puts
    you back together and ties up loose ends.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll open them up to new people, places, and experiences. It’s a great match
    if you don’t push too hard and can find the passion in bed you’ll need.
  prefs: []

- en: '## Aries and Libra'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is a relationship that will need work. It’s great Aries compatibility,
    though: fighter meets lover. You won’t understand each other’s motivations, but
    that won’t matter.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You complement each other, and so as long as you find a way to get past your
    main differences, it will work. You’ll find yourself frustrated at the restraint
    of the Libra.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go into this relationship knowing you need to balance each other. You’ll annoy
    the other, but through compromise, this is a pairing that can work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '## Aries and Scorpio'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scorpio pushes your buttons. You upset easily, and they can do it every time,
    effortlessly. You don’t understand your attraction, but it is undeniable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You want to punch them, but this only seems to drive them wilder and rile you
    up more. This is an exciting, volatile pairing. The sex will be great.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re opposites, and you attract because of this. Nothing makes sense in this
    relationship, but it seems to work anyway.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Embrace this. Do not fear the teasing or Scorpio’s questionable motivations.
    They aren’t doing these things to hurt you, and so as long as you don’t take it
    personally, this can work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '## Aries and Sagittarius'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sagittarius can be more controlling than you want. You have a lot in common,
    and one of those things is independence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you’re okay with Sagittarius off on their own, they may not give you the
    same freedom. Neither of you is a team player, and as you try to lead each other,
    you can find the relationship falling apart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The arguments aren’t hot, and you’re both too stubborn to get around to the
    making-up part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you fall seriously for a Sagittarius, you’re going to need to navigate this
    with caution. This pairing can make for a great fling, but the long-term potential
    is rough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aries and Capricorn
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Capricorn can be a great match for you. Capricorn is willing to work for the
    relationship. They also compliment your need to go from project to project with
    a hard persistence to see things through to the end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Capricorn won’t back down from your more intense moments and wants to ride it
    out. They want you to succeed as much as you do and will put in the work to help
    without feeling the need to put their own problems first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Capricorn is one of the better Aries compatibility.
  prefs: []

- en: Aries and Aquarius
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aquarius may be drawn to you, but you will probably not have the long-term patience
    for an Aquarius.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aquarius is introverted, calm, and contemplative. They like the idea of you,
    but they will probably burn out fast. Because of the initial projection onto you,
    it can start hot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be wary to not misinterpret this. At their core, they cannot sustain it. Once
    the true Aquarius colors come out, they’ll retreat to reading books in bed when
    you want to go out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will become bored and annoyed by this behavior. If the relationship is genuine
    and meant to be, you can make it work by giving each other the freedom to be their
    true selves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aquarius’s thoughtfulness can provide a nice compliment to your long-term plans.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There will be a lot on the surface to like about this pairing. You play off
    each other well, and to everyone else, it looks like you’re perfect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You both like physical affection and new experiences in bed. But be wary of
    your natural tendencies. Pisces follows and you lead. This can quickly turn into
    a dysfunctional situation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pisces will fall for you fast, so make sure to keep your relationship status
    known before you hurt the Pisces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a tricky pairing to navigate. Your opposite qualities can complement
    each other, but they can also lead to a lot of friction.
