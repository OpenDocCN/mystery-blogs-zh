    importance over the coming 12 months. You may, in your opinion, be worth your
    weight in gold but if they see you as arrogant it could damage your ambitions.

    There is no reason why you should not be friends but with Mercury turning retrograde
    today if you say the wrong thing it could lead to a parting of the ways.

    tells you that something is not quite right about your current situation, and
    your instincts are rarely wrong. Don’t commit yourself until you know for sure
    what’s what.

    be they are giving you only half the story in the hope that you will make accusations
    against someone that they are too afraid to make themselves. Don’t fall for it.

    know by now that few things in life come for free. Make sure you know what will
    be expected of you in return. It may be too high a price to pay.

    It may seem as if you are the one who is losing out but in the long-term you will
    gain in ways you had not expected. Good deeds never go unrewarded for long.

    can read you like an open book. The best move you can make today is to be entirely
    open and honest about what you’ve been up to. It’s really not that much of a big
    deal.

    Come right out with it and let them know what is going on, and what the consequences
    are likely to be. Honesty is always the best policy.

    you will be thinking straight. Now that you know that you are less likely to make
    any spur of the moment decisions that could cost you money if you get them wrong.
