    also known as the “third angle” and is calculated based on the intersection of
    the ecliptic and the prime vertical. The vertex is not a planet, but rather a
    point that represents a certain kind of energy in a person’s life.

    It is believed to bring people and situations into a person’s life that are meant
    to help them grow and evolve spiritually. The vertex is also associated with relationships
    and is said to indicate the kind of partner a person is destined to meet. Astrologers

    and important relationships. It is not a planet, but [similar to Part of Fortune](https://teaandrosemary.com/part-of-fortune-astrology/),
    is rather a mathematical point that is derived from the intersection of the ecliptic
    (the path of the Sun) and the prime vertical (the plane that runs from due east
    to due west).

    a point of high energy and intensity. It is associated with sudden and unexpected
    events, as well as with people who come into our lives for a specific purpose.

    insight into the types of people and experiences that are likely to have a significant
    impact on an individual’s life. For example, if the Vertex is in Aries, the person
    may have fated encounters with assertive and independent individuals, while if
    the Vertex is in the 7th house, the person may have important relationships that
    involve partnership and cooperation.

    planets and points in the chart, as these can provide additional information about
    the nature of the fated encounters and relationships that the Vertex represents.
    For example, a Vertex that is closely conjunct the Sun may indicate a powerful
    and transformative encounter with a male figure, while a Vertex that is square
    to Saturn may suggest fated challenges and obstacles in important relationships.

    and relationships that shape our lives. While it is not as well-known as some
    of the other points in the chart, it can provide valuable insights that can help
    individuals navigate their personal and professional relationships with greater
    awareness and understanding.
