 ## Casting Instructions for 'Sunny Weather and Clear Skies'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Take a container of some kind (I used a blue bottle cap) and pour some water into it,
preferably mineral water or spring water but any will do. Then put some salt in it and leave it
on a windowsill if it is sunny or windy (if windy you need to make sure that it is secured and
wont blow away). If it is wet outside or humid and the water will not evaporate away, leave it
in your house in a warm place or by a window. As you pour the salt in, imagine the mixture
becoming the clouds in the sky visualize it evaporating and the clouds evaporating with it.
Then leave it to evaporate in its place. Only remove when all of the water has gone.
