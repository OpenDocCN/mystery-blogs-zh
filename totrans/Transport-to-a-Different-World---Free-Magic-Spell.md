When do you actually teleport like do you teleport there after a hour or something

You can't magickally teleport to another world, with magick, so this spell won't have any results.

You cannot physically teleport.

Anyway, I think this spell is kinda SUS.

i believe there is a spelling error in this spell just a heads up. for those wondering you cannot physically teleport period at our current technology and magick will not do this either however if you performed this spell in a lucid dream it will then become possible.
