- en: My spiritual journey has been very long and, at times, a troublesome journey
    that took me from learning about magick into becoming a Wiccan, and then moving
    towards Paganism. From Paganism I slowly found the Draconian path of D.J. Conway’s
    books. Eventually I found myself drawn to the path of Spiritual Satanism, in which
    JOS and Ea Koetting were the main contributors to this change.

    suppose it ran in the family as two of my other brothers were just like me when
    it came to reading books.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But anyways, I began reading a ton of books and book series. However, I ran
    across a book series called Sweep. It intrigued me because it was a fictional
    book series that was mainly focused around Wicca and magick.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I got to around the third book in the series I was curious as to whether
    or not Wicca was a real religion or not. So I went online at my Middle School’s
    computer room, which was next to the library, and I looked up Wicca and soon found
    dozens of websites talking about Wicca. And within about half an hour I had read
    quite a bit about Wicca and realized that the book series I was reading actually
    wasn’t making much of anything up when it came to Wiccan beliefs or even magick.

- en: Now the first thing I did after I found all of this out was to learn how to
    cast spells and work with magick. So the first website I came into contact with
    was spellsofmagic.com.

    a Ki ball of energy, and boy was I amazed that I could actually feel the tingling
    magickal energy on the palms of my hands.

    and even though I didn’t I understand a lot about the occult world, I knew that
    it was meant for me.

- en: Moving onward with my spiritual journey I began to move away from Wicca and
    into Paganism, and from then on out I began to really open up myself to magickal
    practices and started to have what many call a spiritual awakening.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And eventually everything just clicked; I could somehow inherently know things
    that I never studied in detail. I was seemingly more “advanced” than most people
    who studied in the occult and magickal practices. However, I had not learned the
    art of evocation and invocation of spirits; nor had I learned how to speak with
    spirits telepathically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I soon found the Draconian path of D.J. Conway through a YouTuber known
    as DragonFeather. So I eventually asked for the two “dragon” books by D.J. Conway
    for Christmas, and low n’ behold my Grandmother had gotten them for me even though
    she had no clue as to what those two books contained.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I learned quite a bit of information from those books, and with that new knowledge
    basis I also gained new experiences, one of which was telepathy when I contacted
    my Dragon “spirits”.

- en: For some time I thought that this path was the so called true path that I had
    been searching for all this time, (as this was probably around three to four years
    into the occult).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, as fate would have it, the Draconian path wasn’t calling to me as strongly
    as was the demon known as Azazel, who found me while I was watching some of Ea
    Koetting’s YouTube videos.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was a slightly painful move away from the Draconian path and into the Satanic
    path which was mostly fueled by the Joy of Satan group, which also in hindsight
    wasn’t the best group to get mixed up with, but I suppose everyone grows up eventually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this field of “magick,” I also figured out how to hone my skills of telepathy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    as The Serpent’s Key channel, (there were a few others, but those two channels
    were the main ones).

- en: Eventually I began to find some information on demonic children, or in other
    terms, people who have (a) demonic parent(s). This led me to trying to figure
    out who I was, or what my spiritual ancestry was, (if you can call it that.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, I could never truly pinpoint who I was exactly, but during this soul
    searching time I commented on a YouTube video to help someone out with summoning
    demons, (because at this time I was pretty well versed and experienced with what
    and how to evoke or invoke demons and other spirits).

    other via an app called Telegram.

- en: We slowly began to become good friends and we helped each other out in many
    aspects of life as well to study and research occult topics, and we both were
    interested in seeing who we were spiritually. This led to us believing and being
    told by demons and other spirits that we were actual mythological gods; (later
    we discovered that this wasn’t entirely true.)
  prefs: []

    to channel demons and other spirits to get information from them.

    to), I attempted to compile a list of demons, with all of their sigils, all of
    their mythological and Biblical names, as well as other information about them.
    This was simply something I did to pass time and to gain more knowledge on the
    different demons and spirits out there.

    and it seemed as though ours was going, because I, for some reason or another,
    wanted to end our friendship, (this was a few years ago, so bare with me as I
    do not fully remember why I wanted to end our relationship). But I did finally
    end my relationship with my friend and I was seemingly free of having to worry
    about him all the time, and I could now focus more on myself and becoming a God
    then I normal had in the past.
  prefs: []

    forum had a section for doing such readings. I slowly ‘mastered’ this art by continually
    practicing and honing my skills in this field.

    when he talked about the three god-like powers, which are omnipotence (through
    summoning), omnipresence (through soul travel), and omniscience (through divination).
    I honestly was very good at all but one of them and that was soul travel.

    me and tells me that he found out that the demons and other spirits we were working
    with were actually lying to us about trying to help us to become a god. They in
    fact would restrict us in power, to the point were we couldn’t become a god. So
    we quickly disbanded from all of the demons and other spirits we had been working
    with, and soon we started to progress in spiritual power and both of us were having
    relatively better success in certain areas of our spirituality.

    trying to find my niche in Taoism, Buddhism or some other eastern philosophy.
    Even so, I still wanted to become a god and I also wanted to find something different,
    something that would help me along my path. I was open to anything new, and I
    had no idea what was about to happen to my life.

    got me to go to a Catholic Basilica in southern Wisconsin. I was amazed at the
    beauty of the place, and we sat down in one of the pews of one of the parishes
    at this place, and I thought long and hard about whether or not God was real and
    whether or not I should go down that path.

    to now is music based around Biblical topics; I’ve even stopped playing video
    games. I also got rid of most of my books and DVD’s that weren’t Biblical. I even

    going to judge every thought you ever thunk, every deed you ever did and everything
    you’ve ever said (Matt. 12:36, Rom. 2:16). But if you are not saved by the grace
    of God then you can not enter into Heaven, this is because God does not reward
    sinners with an eternal life of peace and tranquility, he instead punishes sinners
    righteously for the wicked things they have done.
