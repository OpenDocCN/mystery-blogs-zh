- en: My spiritual journey has been very long and, at times, a troublesome journey
    that took me from learning about magick into becoming a Wiccan, and then moving
    towards Paganism. From Paganism I slowly found the Draconian path of D.J. Conway’s
    books. Eventually I found myself drawn to the path of Spiritual Satanism, in which
    JOS and Ea Koetting were the main contributors to this change.

    dozens of websites talking about Wicca. And within about half an hour I had read
