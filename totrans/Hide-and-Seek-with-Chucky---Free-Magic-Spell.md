# Hide and Seek with Chucky

  Rated 1/5 Stars

This is a hide and seek game with Chucky the doll.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Stuffed chucky doll

*   Bag of uncooked rice

*   Needle

*   Crimson thread

*   Sharp machete knife

*   Cup of natural salt

*   Water

*   Black candles

*   Cat skull

## Casting Instructions for 'Hide and Seek with Chucky'

 Light the candle and say: "Spirit of chucky come I offer you my blood and this cat skull."

Cut open the doll and remove the stuffing. Fill the doll with uncooked rice. (In many Asian cultures, uncooked rice is believed to attract spirits).

Clip your fingernails and put them inside the doll. (This binds the doll to you).

Sew the doll up with the crimson thread, then tie up the doll with the rest of the thread. (The thread represents blood and binds the spirit to the doll).

Fill the bathtub with water.

Place a cup of salt water inside your hiding place.
Choose a name for your doll. (Naming a spirit makes it more powerful). Name will be chucky

At 3 AM, go to the bathroom, pick up the doll and say three times: "(Your Name) is the first it!"

Place the doll in the bathtub, take the knife with you and go around the house turning off all the lights. Switch on the TV and leave it on a static white noise channel.

Go back to your hiding place, close your eyes and count to ten.

Return to the bathroom with the knife in your hand.

Say: "I have found you, (Dolls Name)!" and stab the doll with the knife.

Say three times:" Now (Dolls Name) is it!." and put the doll and the knife back in the bathtub.

Immediately, run back to your hiding place and wait.

At this point, you may hear the pitter patter of tiny feet. If the doll is close, you will hear the white noise on the TV change. Apart from the sound of footsteps and things being moved around, some people have reported horrible smells, drastic changes in temperature, and the TV suddenly switching off or the volume changing dramatically. Some have reported the sensation of being touched or pulled on.

If at any time, you feel the doll is about to find you, end the game.

To end the game, take a mouthful of salt water. Keep it in your mouth. Dont swallow it. Get out of the hiding place and start looking for the doll. The doll is not necessarily in the bathroom. It could be anywhere. Whatever happens, dont spit out the salt water until you find the doll.

When you find it, pour the rest of the salt water in the cup over it, then spit the salt water in your mouth over it as well. Say three times: "I win! and cut off the crimson thread." This is supposed to free the spirit and end the ritual.

After this make sure you dry the doll, and burn or discard it later.

Rules:

*   Do not stop this ritual halfway through. You must do it through to the end.
*   Do not go outside of the house.
*   Do not play this game for more than two hours, or the spirit will become too powerful and will not leave the doll.
*   You must be alone in the house when you play. You can play with friends, but if there is someone else in the house who is not playing, they will be in mortal danger if the doll finds them instead.
*   When you are returning to your hiding place, do not look behind you.
*   You must turn off all lights and keep very quiet while hiding.
*   Do not leave your hiding place without salt water in your mouth. The doll will still be searching for you.
*   If you are religious, take a symbol of protection from your religion into the hiding place with you (eg: a crucifix, rosary beads, a scapular, a Hamsa or a Buddhist amulet or talisman).

This is a very dangerous ritual and we advise you not to try it. We will not be responsible for what happens to you if you try it. If you make a mistake, you could wind up stabbed to death or possessed by an evil spirit.

This does not work for a number of reasons, but the biggest one is you cannot make an inanimate object come to life. For safety reasons, I should remind you not to play with knifes. To quote Billy Bones ''beware running with scissors, or any other pointy objects. It's all good fun, until someone loses an eye.''
