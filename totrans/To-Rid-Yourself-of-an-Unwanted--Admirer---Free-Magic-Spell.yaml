- en: Occasionally people get into a situation where they are being pursued by someone
    whose attention is a nuisance. Rather than reacting in anger, it is often easier
    to open the way for the unwanted suitor to leave. This spell, done on a Waning
    Moon - often does the trick

    offending person. Fling the leaves on the fire and say: "Withdraw from me now
    I need you not". There is a requirement to declaim passionately, and to use some
    force, in any spell that is designed to drive someone from you. Therefore, be
    very sure that you do not wish this person to be in your life in any way.'

- en: Ensure the fire is properly and safely extinguished. Repeat the action three
    nights in a row. Preferably this spell should be performed outside,but it can
    be also be performed indoors if you have a suitable fireplace and provided you
    are careful.Strictly, one is supposed to gather the vervain leaves, though with
    urban living this is a bit of a tall order. Make sure you have at least a couple
    of handfuls of the dried herb.
