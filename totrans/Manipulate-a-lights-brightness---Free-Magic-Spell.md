Please remain calm as you read the following words. This is plausible. Hear me out! Magik is energy. Causing a lightbulb to flicker because you charged too much energy is plausible. I have seen it happen. It is far more common to manipulate a candle flame to flicker than a lightbulb, but it can happen. You are tapping into its energy with your Magikal energy and they are vibrating at the same frequency. This is the same reason lights flicker when spirits and other entities are nearby. You will never charge enough energy to make a lightbulb explode, nor can you make a candle flame grow into a blazing inferno. Less energy and concentration is required to move a candle flame over a lightbulb because fire is a natural element and the electricity in a lightbulb is tapped within glass and wires. You do not need a chant, but if it helps then use it. It is about focusing your Magik into the object and manipulating the energy with your will.

As for this being a spell, no, it is an energy manipulation technique. Including the chant could transform it into a spell, but spells are like ritualized prayers. You are asking for something specific through this process. This is just controlling energy for fun. Not saying that as an insult, simply a fact. Since the energy has no purpose other than to practice how to manipulate it, this would be an energy exercise, not a spell.
