    a physical and energetic boundary between the sacred space inside and the external
    world. By closing the door, practitioners create a realm where their focused intentions
    can manifest without interference from outside influences. This boundary helps
    to create a concentrated and protected environment conducive to successful spellcasting.

    the opening of the spiritual realm. It represents a shift from ordinary reality

    blurred. This can lead to a loss of focus and the dispersion of energy necessary
    for successful spellcasting.

    or unwanted energies, that may disrupt the flow of the ritual. It can also leave
    the ritual space vulnerable to negative or chaotic energies, compromising the
    intentions and desired outcomes of the spell. Without the protection and containment
    offered by a closed door, the energy may dissipate, making it more difficult for
    the practitioner to harness and direct it effectively.

    connection to the divine and the spiritual realms. The open door may serve as
    an open invitation for energies that are not in alignment with the practitioner’s
    intentions or that may interfere with the ritual’s purpose. This can dilute the
    potency of the spell and hinder the practitioner’s ability to attain their desired
    outcome.
