 Light the candles as you say:

"Couple I see, couple I name,
I cursed thee,
Cords of dismay,
Cords of hate,
Cords of jealousy,
This being the cords of three,
Fall under my spell,
Your relationship shall now fail,
Dismay you shall feel,
Jealousy of each other there shall be,
I times this with the cords of three,
But let hate be the curse I put upon thee,
And So may it be."

Then bring the cord and focusing all your energy and remember your reasons of hatred for theses 2 and imagine them during the final fight and then cut the cord and burn the two halves in very far locations (as far as you want them apart).

when you say very far locations? what does this mean? can you burn and dispose of separately or do they have to be burnt in operate places?

I would edit the chant, but this is a basic cord cutting.
