- en: Information: The Psalms have been used for centuries as tools to focus spiritual
    energy towards a specific goal. These sacred writings are believed to contain
    the breath of the Creator. And when these mystical words are combined with visualization
    and intent, magic happens. The power from the Psalms does not come from the items
    used. These items serve as visualization tools. The power comes from the Psalm
    itself and from your visualizations.

    your body is not important, but you want to be comfortable. You should be sitting
    in front of your table with your candle, in its holder, in front of you. The ashtray
    should be next to the candle. And Psalm 70 should be placed where you can read
    it. The rest of the items should be placed on the table as well, but off to the
    side.'

- en: Use the black magic maker to write your enemys name onto the white paper. You
    want to write the name small enough to be able to write the name 10 times on this
    sheet of paper. When you write the name, in black, draw a circle around the name
    with the red marker. The circles should be big enough just to encircle the name.
    The red symbolizes protection. Now, use the scissors to cut the red circled names
    out of the paper. You will now have 10 strips of paper with your enemys name on
    each strip. Dispose of the excess paper.

- en: Light the white candle. The color of the candle symbolizes the purity and righteousness
    of your spell. As the candle is burning, slowly read the unedited version of Psalm
    70, 10 times. Focus on what the words are saying.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, read the personalized version of Psalm 70, 10 times. Again, focus on what
    is being said. As you are reading, picture your enemy attempting to radiate harm
    to you, but that harm is being blocked, magnified, and then sent back to them.
    Picture Gods power flowing through you as you stop your enemys plans to harm you.

- en: Last, repeat the modified version of Psalm 70\. After each reading, place one
    of the strips of paper into the candles flame, and set it into the ashtray. Burning
    the name symbolizes releasing the spell into the spiritual realm. Continues to
    visualize as before. When the last strip is burned, continue to recite the modified
    Psalm for 5 minutes or so. When the spell is complete, clean up your area. You
    can save the candle for additional uses.
