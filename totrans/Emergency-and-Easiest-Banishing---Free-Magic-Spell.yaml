    Just ask for a candle for faith. Usually the spell is "El Sagrado Corazon de Jesus
    Cristo." It is Santeria so sorry for the Jesus part. This spell adds faith for
    you. Make sure you buy it prepared, just say "prepahdough por favor." It should
    be around ten bucks. Teleport to Los Milagros Botanica in Chicago and they have
    it for like $5 USD.
