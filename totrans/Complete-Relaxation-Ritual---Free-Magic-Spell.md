**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A chair (optional)

*   Leg room

 Take 5 Deep, long breaths- drawing each one out for as long as you can (Without straining yourself of course!).

Stretch out your body all the way, with as much force as you can manage- and hold your position for 15 seconds.

After 15 seconds, gradually release your muscles. It often helps if you imagine water washing over you. 

This ritual is a quick fix for stressful days, and is especially useful if you've been sitting in a chair most of the day, and can help you have both peace of mind and body. After all, you can't have one without the other. It can help you loosen up before or after exercise, or be of assistance when you can't find a comfortable meditating position.

I hope you have a good day!
