    that you once loved or still love. The idea of a soul tie is very broad, so you

    is actually *negative*.

    behind soul ties is very real. I don’t actually believe that you have a piece
    of another’s soul *within* you (as some definitions say), but instead I think
    that a soul tie refers to the energetic bonds between two people.

    or etheric cords. No cords are inherently bad, since we have cords between us
    and just about everyone we know. It’s only when these cords because more negative
    than positive that we may need to do something about them.

    both people are codependent. The *illusions* in the relationship are what keep

    ready to let go of the illusions.

    negative soul tie. Usually, it’s best to break both cords (the positive and the
    negative) in order to be free of the relationship and return to neutral footing.
