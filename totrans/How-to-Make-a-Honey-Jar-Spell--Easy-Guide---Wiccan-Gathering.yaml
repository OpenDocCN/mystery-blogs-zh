    magic practitioner needs to know. They’re often used for protection, but they
    can be used in any situation that needs “sweetening”. Could someone benefit from
    being kinder? Could a group benefit from added harmony? These are just a few of
    the great uses of a honey jar spell, and why you should add one to your spell
    arsenal.

    the names of the people you’re promoting harmony in. Then rotate the page as you
    write your intention, encircling the names. Fill the jar with honey and submerge
    the paper. Burn the candle over the jar, sealing it with wax.**'

    else. You might use one to guide a boss into being more considerate. Or you could

    intent more.

    **Don’t lift your pen off of the paper as you write.** To do this, write in cursive
    and don’t worry about dotting i’s or crossing t’s for now.*   Rotate your paper
    at a 90-degree angle but continue to keep your pen on the page. Write your name
    on top of the first name three times. Your name should cross the other person’s
    name, or your name if you’re casting the spell on yourself.*   Take in five deep
    breaths with your eyes closed.*   Open your eyes and focus on your intent as you
    stare at the paper.*   Write your intent as a circle around the name grid you’ve
    created.*   Your goal is to make a circle, so again don’t lift the pen as you
    write. Aim to have a complete circle once you’re done. You could simply write
    “happiness,” “love,” or “harmony” over and over as long as your intent is clear
    and the circle forms.*   Once you’re done, you can lift your pen off of the paper
    to add dots to your i’s or lines to your t’s.*   Fold your paper in half, facing
    the direction of the other person’s name. Rotate your paper at another 90-degree
    angle and fold it in half in the direction of your name this time.*   Fill your
    jar with all your spell items– honey, herbs, crystals, and any other charms.*   Submerge
    your paper into the honeyed jar. While doing so, state your intent. It could be
    as simple as *“Sweet honey, please aid in making (other person’s name) sweeter
    towards me. Just as you’re sweet, so shall (other person’s name) be. As is my
    will, so mote it be.”* Of course, you can tweak those lines as much as you want
    to suit your needs.*   Once you’re done, your finger should come off with some
    honey on it. Lick the honey off and close your jar. Savor its sweet taste.*   Place
    your candle on top of the honey jar and light it.*   Focus on your intention as
    the candle burns, and allow the candle to burn completely. Keep the candle wax
    on top of the jar even when you store the jar in a different spot. Light a candle
    and focus on your intent as much as you want on the following days or whenever
    you feel like it to reinforce your honey jar spell.
