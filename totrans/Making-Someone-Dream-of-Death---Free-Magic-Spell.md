**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Pot with water

*   Celery stick

*   Knife or athame

*   Jasmine tea bag

 Focus on the hate for the person and drain it in the water by passing your hand over or through the water. Put the pot on the stove to boil, put the stove on high heat. When the water starts to boil, throw in the jasmine and put in the celery. You could put the whole thing, so that it sticks up or break it into pieces. Once that is completed, let the water boil for a while and focus on your hate for the person, focus on what you want. I would find that hard to imagine so I just repeat what I want to happen to myself and just trust and know.

After youve done that for a while, put in the knife. Let the sharp part stick in the water and the handle part stick out of the pot. Leave to boil for as long as youd life you could say an incantation to go along. Just make sure you say "With no true death to them". And thats it.
