This sounds like someone trying to appear native, but are not actually native. I do not want to say it is appropriation, but it makes me feel it is. What language is the chant suppose to be? What tribe is this from? I suppose you could try it and see if it works for you. I would suggest purchasing the ingredients required from a local tribe or store that supports a native community.

no i am native american i posted this on another account i may not have spelled everything right but ye...

If you claim to be native, then I will believe you. I get concerned when an anonymous person post rituals online from closed religions and cultures many simply lie and paint over their made up views with a glossy coat of native culture to seem special. I am not saying you are doing this, I am trying to explain my concern and why I commented. I am interested to know what nation this is from, and what language it is meant to be. I know native language is oral and few have written, so spelling is not a major concern.
