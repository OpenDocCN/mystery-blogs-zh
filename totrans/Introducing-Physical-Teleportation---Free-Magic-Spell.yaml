- en: 'Physical teleportation is the near instantaneous transport of the psychic from
    one location to another. Because teleportation is an extension of clairsentient
    ability, there are two categories of teleportation: Extensive Teleportation and
    Projective Teleportation. As the names imply, each is based on the type of clairsentience
    which must be used to target the correct location.'

    upon arrival at the new location.

- en: 'Extensive Teleportation: this is the ability to teleport one''s body a short
    distance, overcoming intervening barriers to normal travel. In order to use extensive
    teleportation, the targeted location must be sensed via sense extension, or must
    be in physical sight of the psychic. Teleportation is nearly instantaneous once
    activated, and can generally be accomplished in the same OP during which clairsentience
    was used to locate the target. The psychic remains subject to possible disorientation
    at the new location.'
