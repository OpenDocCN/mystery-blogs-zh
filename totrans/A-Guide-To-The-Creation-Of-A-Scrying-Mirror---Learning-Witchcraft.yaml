    are a few things you must gather if you want to perform this spell.

    you choose a regular mirror, think about painting it black. You can also go with
    black obsidian.

    Put the mugwort inside. Fill it completely. After this is done, boil some water.
    Once you see the bubbles, put the hot water in the jar so that all the mugwort
    is submerged. Then, put on the lid and make sure it fits well.

    will vary, as the size has an impact. After the infusion is done, strain the concoction
    and take out the herbs. The infusion needs to be placed in a chalice.

    deity of divination’s that you can try and bring forth, like Hecate, Odin, Freya,
    Hermes, Cerridwen or Brigid. Pick someone that you relate to personally.

    mind of any other thought that might consume you. Submerge the scrying mirror
    in the mugwort and picture the mirror becoming a tool that you can use.
