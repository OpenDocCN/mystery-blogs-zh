    the basil and honeysuckle, then sprinkled the cinnamon on top. This is completely
    optional, alternatively you could just burn the herbs yourself during the rite.
    I just feel like this is a much cleaner and safer way to burn herbs. I usually
    do this a day or two before the actual spell and leave the candle & crystal in
    the windowsill to be cleansed by the sun. Again, totally optional. This is just
    my personal way of doing things and every witch's path is different!

    two major accidents on the high road, and I didn't drive my best at all! But I
    still passed, and my instructor was really nice and said that she could see that
    I was a reasonable driver even tho I made a few mistakes. Thank you so much!!
