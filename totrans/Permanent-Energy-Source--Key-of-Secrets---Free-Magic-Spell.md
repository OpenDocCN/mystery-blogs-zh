**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Trinket, object of any kind

*   Colored candle

*   Steel Nails

*   Metal Plate

*   A box

 First, you need to cleanse your working space, then cast a circle (you need to know to do this properly)

inside a circle, put some small compact object (that will be your anchor) that's associated with the source (for example small pedant of the moon if the source is the moon or obsidian necklace if source is center of the earth, or key for etheric field)

Put a simple box atop of your object, and atop of the box, put an metal plate. Put an colored candle in the metal plate, but note that color of candle must represent source of your energy.

At the upper third of your candle, attach 8 pins (just poke 'em in the waxy candle). Then light up the candle

You will need to meditate inside the circle, lying down or sitting, visualizing that anchor connecting with the supposed source of energy. You need to meditate until wax burns down and all pins fall to the metal plate from the candle. Then, you need to note in which shape pins fell. Draw that shape on the paper, that will be the code word, or the "sigil" of your anchor. When you visualize the shape, or look at it on the paper, you are unlocking a pathway to the source with your anchor key, while doing so, meditate on drawing energy trough this channel.

You can leave anchor on the paper with code word, just be sure to draw circle around it and build up some basic protection around it, because you don't want certain entities coming to the leakage of the energy. By doing so, you have perpetual generator of supposed energy, a channel to the source.
