- en: One of the best amulets for ending a relationship is a blessed, charged piece
    of fluorite. Besides helping you both to see your situation clearly, the natural
    3-D diamond shape of this stone provides a firm foundation on which to base your
    parting words.

- en: To charge the fluorite, leave it in sunlight for seven minutes (for a conscious,
    logical decision) and in moonlight for seven minutes (for sensitivity). Carry
    this with you, touching it momentarily before delivering the bad news. Afterward,
    you may want to throw the stone away to detach yourself further from the relationship
    and its energy.

    Take a small, clear amethyst (for self-control), socialite (for emotional balance),
    and a carnelian (to decrease anger), and put them in a glass of spring water.
    Visualize purple, blue-white, and reddish light, respectively, emanating from
    the stones and filling the water. Take the glass in hand, saying:'

    Try a talisman made from a clear quartz (to clear energy) and jet (to collect
    excess negativity). Place the stones in a pouch filled with mint (to inspire peace),
    along with any object that represents the person you wish to forgive. As you place
    the token in the pouch, say:'
