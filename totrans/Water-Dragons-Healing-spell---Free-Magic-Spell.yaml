- en: calling on a water Dragon for healing can work, but this chant seems a bit nervous?
    i would instead say ''oh Water Dragon hear my cry, lend me your healing chi. Let
    it flow and heal me. May I heal at your wish, so mote it be'' it has a bit more
    confidence to it, because if you are asking a Dragon for help, one would assume
    you already work with them, and therefore they know you don't intend to abuse
    their gifts.

- en: '''''Slowly heal faster'''' is a bit of an oxymoron, but a slight increase in
    the time it takes to heal is plausible with Magik. This spell walks a fine line
    for me. You cannot gain dragon powers. You also cannot gain elemental powers.
    But, calling on a spiritual entity in your craft is real. So, asking a water dragon
    to assist in a healing is plausible. I would edit the chant and charge the water
    with Magikal energy while imagining the outcome.'

- en: Add a pinch or three of salt as you chant. Salt helps water remove infection,
    though to gain that benefit you would need to add a fairly large amount for the
    volume of water in a bathtub. However in this case adding salt can tie the body
    of water with the ocean and its depths.

- en: As far as the chant itself goes, it has some flexibility, as Nekoshema already
    mentioned. As long as you present yourself to the dragons as a person asking for
    help, and recognizing their position. It could be something as simple as ''Great
    dragons of the depths, honor me with your healing waters.'' Approach with a sense
    of gratitude, and the chant that works for you should come naturally.

  zh: 就咒语本身而言，正如Nekoshema已经提到的，它具有一定的灵活性。只要你以寻求帮助的人的身份出现，并认识到它们的地位，都可以。它可能只是像“深海伟大的龙啊，请用你的治愈之水荣耀我。”以感激之心接近，适合你的咒语应该自然而然地出现。
