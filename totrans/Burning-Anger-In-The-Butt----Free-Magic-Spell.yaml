    Put the heat proof container nearby. It should be large enough to hold a piece
    of burning paper. Sit at the table and take the piece of paper and pencil in your
    hand and write a letter about how your feeling. Write about why you are feeling
    that way. Pour all your heart and soul into writing this. Be very specific and
    focus on the feeling while you are writing this letter. If someone/something caused
    you to feel this way, you may start it out with Dear So-and-So if you so wish.
    After you have completed the letter (it can be longer then 1 piece of paper) take
    it and catch it on fire with the candle. Put it in the heatproof container and
    gaze into the flames. See all your hurt, anger, sorrow, etc. being burned up by
    the cleansing flames. Visualize this until there are no longer any flames or glowing
    embers left. Repeat with 2nd paper if the letter is longer than 1 piece of paper.
    Remember to take your time when writing the letter. There is no rush. :) Snuff
    the candle when finished.'
