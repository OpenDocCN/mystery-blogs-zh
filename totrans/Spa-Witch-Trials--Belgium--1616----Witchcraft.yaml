- en: The Spa Witch Trials took place in the city of Spa in present day Belgium (then
    part of the Spanish Netherlands) in 1616\. It was one of the larger and best known
    of the witch trials in Belgium, and led to the execution of ten women, and possibly
    the death of another four.

- en: The events began early in 1616, when the authorities of Franchimont issued an
    investigation of sorcery after a strange plague had caused the deaths of both
    humans an animals in the area. The public was encouraged to report any suspicious
    gatherings in the forest, anyone absent from work, anyone giving bread to the
    sick (perceived as an attempt to bewitch them), and husbands who suspected their
    wives of committing adultery with devils.

- en: The allegations appear to day to have been very circumstantial. The husband
    of Maroie Herodes gave as evidence for claims that she was a witch the fact that
    she had once felt very cold on return after an absence. Another man had heard
    Isabeau delle Court and Gelette Noel talked of as witches, and claimed that his
    horse had been sick after passing them.

    to death by garroting and burning. Ten were executed, and the remaining four possibly
    died in prison during torture.
