This is fake. Running some words through a Latin translator does not make this genuine. Blood spells bind the spell to the target in a powerful way. Taking some salt and saying ''I don't want to be cursed anymore'' in Latin will do nothing. It would require an energy intensive cleansing and protection and even then it is not a guarantee. This has zero energy behind it. All you are doing is lighting a candle and saying words. You've done nothing to target the root cause of your plight.
