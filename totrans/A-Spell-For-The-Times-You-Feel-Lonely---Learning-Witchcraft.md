# A Spell For The Times You Feel Lonely - Learning Witchcraft

> 来源：[https://learningwitchcraft.com/a-spell-for-the-times-you-feel-lonely/#0001-01-01](https://learningwitchcraft.com/a-spell-for-the-times-you-feel-lonely/#0001-01-01)

Whether it’s a new home or a new job, moving means you lose the connections you once had.

The world seems made for the extroverted and outgoing, and so if you’re shy it can be even more difficult to make those connections.

Hopefully, this spell will help.

**Here’s what you’ll need:**

1 x piece of scrap paper
1 x piece of parchment
1 x pen
1 x orange candle
1 x hurricane lamp, empty
1 x bolline
1 x jar
1 x part salt

Take the pen and paper and write down a few things that describe you, your personality, and who you are as a person.

Now take what you’ve written, and edit it down to use as few words as possible.

Once you’ve gotten that done, write those words on the parchment. You’ll want as few words as possible because you will then inscribe them onto the candle.

Fill the jar a third of the way up with salt.

Take the parchment, roll it up, and bury it into the char. Seal the jar and put it in the safest place near you bed that you can find.

Take the candle, which should now be inscribed, and place it into the hurricane lamp. Light the candle. If you have a cat or dog, keep them away from the lamp. Accidents will happen!

Focus on the flame, watching the candle burn, and visualize your life with the new friends and connections you want to make. You’ll need to declare your intention next.

*Help me, bring to me new friends*
*Take my loneliness and make it end.*

As you fall asleep, visualize what you’ve inscribed onto the candle drift off into nothingness.

You can wake in confidence that you won’t have to worry about making new friends. Of course, this is a two way street. You’ll have to actually put some effort into talking and meeting people if you really want it to work!
