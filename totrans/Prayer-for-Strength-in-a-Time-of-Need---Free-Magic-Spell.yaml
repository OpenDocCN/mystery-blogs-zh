    is not required. Lower yourself to your knees, in a bowing position, and chant
    calmly focusing on your words and them reaching the deity your are praying to.

- en: It might work, but in a dangerous situation, I do not think you want to say
    a long chant. I would consider grounding your energy, making yourself invisible,
    and stealth yourself out of the situation. Please note, when I say ''invisible''
    it will not be physical, invisibility spells make people overlook you by grounding
    your energy. If you wish to test this chant, I would do so before a competition
    over waiting until you are in danger.
