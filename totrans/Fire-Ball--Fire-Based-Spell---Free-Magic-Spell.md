# Fire Ball- Fire Based Spell

This spell enables you to create a fire ball. It takes massive amounts of energy, but after MUCH practice, you could create several without wasting a breath! There are many different versions, many which are stronger, but this is best for beginners.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Fire Ball- Fire Based Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Energy (VERY important!)

*   A friend

*   Experience with magical fire

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Energy (VERY important!)

*   A friend

*   Experience with magical fire

(The reason I included magical fire in the ingredients is because it is quite different and usually used for attacks and defenses rather than warmth. If you wish for warmth, please click my history box to see my first spell on warmth)

1\. Sit or stand with your friend by your side. It is always good to have a friend during practice in case all your energy is taken from you.
2\. Next, focus on your hand. Envision it so that every crease and hair on your hand is memorized beneath your eyelids. (This is the part in which is not always necessary after many months of practice.)
3\. Gather the warmth at the tips of your fingers and mutter the following words:
Let fire warm my hand
And that of the ice in my opponents land
Let his soul burn in grief
As he withers like a leaf
4\. The part above can be spoken out loud, in your mind, or envisioned in your head: The most common choice is envisioning the words for it is faster.
5\. This is when your friend comes in handy. All energy and bloods attention is focused on the building heat and soon will take form. The more energy and belief, the better. If it does not work, do not panic. Just repeat the verse a couple more times. If you are a very beginner, I recommend patience. I have still not mastered this spell, but after months of practice I have created one or two.
6\. (Optional) To create many, you simply envision just as many hands.
If you want six balls, you have six hands, one an exact copy of the other. It takes no less time but A LOT of energy.
7\. Stay safe and have fun!
8\. Finally, to take it away, you blow hard unless you have already used it, for example; In a duel.
