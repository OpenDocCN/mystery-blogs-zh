Wind come to me, 

As I summon thee, 

To come with a song for thee.

Then sing once,

Who has seen the wind, neither I or you

But when the trees bow down their heads,

The wind is passing by, where are you going,

And we're have you been, will we feel a gentle breeze when you visit once again,

Passing through the wind is passing through

Passing through the wind is passing through

Who has seen the wind, who has seen the wind

Who has seen the wind ,who has seen the wind

Neither I nor you.

Hold the last note for about ten seconds.

Then your done.

Tell me what happens in the comments cuz I can't wait to hear the results! I actually was singing the song earlier today and it literally summoned the wind. I know that because I felt a big whoosh of air hit me and it wasn't even windy.

When I was explaining the song/spell I ment wind not win...just a FYI

You cannot control the wind with a song.

Do you personally hate me or something?!?

I do not ''hate'' anyone. I do not know you. Merely disagreeing with a person does not equate hatred. I comment on all fake spells regardless of user. I wish to help new members know which ones are a waste of their time so they do not get discouraged when their spells do not work. Whomever wrote them does not matter to me. If it is a fake spell, I will say so, there is no other motive beyond that. You should not take things so personally, not everything is about you. Sometimes people disagree, but it does not mean nefarious intentions.

I can tell that you hate me alot

Pray tell, why do you conclude that?

And I said summoning not controlling

Cuz ever since I posted spells I found in an old spell book in my basement you've been saying their fake or won't work.

My mistake, you cannot SUMMON the wind either.

A spell book in your basement you say? I also said I do not hate you. I do not know you. From the behaviour I have seen form you so far, and after reading your profile, I can conclude you are young, love Harry Potter, think you could be a vampire, and have zero understanding of Real Magic as well as zero patience for those who disagree with you. For the record, Magic is a natural energy that does not defy nature. It effects energy to bring natural change. You are human, and while Harry Potter is a fine series of books, it is a complete work of fiction. None of it is real.

Who cares about my stupid bio!!! Anything can happen in the magic world!!!

Btw my sister put the Vampire and cookies thing on my bio...she wants to embarrass me

And yes there is a spell book in my basement
