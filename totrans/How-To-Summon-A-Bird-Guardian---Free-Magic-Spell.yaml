    there is a slight glow in the gems. Imagine the glow getting stronger until they
    make the feather rise into the air. Then, imagine the feather growing into wing,
    and the wing growing into a bird. Imagine the bird morphing into what kind of
    bird you want it to be. Think of it coming to land on your shoulder. Open your
    eyes.
