    you won’t be able to do that until you have tied up various emotional loose ends.
    Make that your goal for the next six months – and the six months after that will
    be amazing.

    out into the world and have some fun. Don’t worry that your financial and work
    situations are still under a menacing cloud – there are much brighter skies up
    ahead.

    much difference over the next few days. The momentum you have built up in recent
    weeks will carry you along at speed for quite a way yet. It’s still a great ride.

    now both Venus and Mercury have moved into your sign your enthusiasm should start
    to pick up once more. The good days are here again. The great days won’t be far
    behind.

    ahead of the game, both at work and in your private life, so stay calm and carry
    on as before. There is no such thing as failure – every setback makes you stronger.

    work toward that goal each and every day. Small steps become giant leaps over

    Having said that, you may need to up your game on the work front over the next
    few days. The more rivals try to talk you down the more you must talk yourself
    up.

    fact that a financial decision you took a while back has not worked out for the
    best. You need to be brave and own up to that fact, then do something about it.

    is they are and you must decide what you are going to do about it. As a first
    move you might want to ask them what’s wrong. It could be something really simple.

    considerable progress, but as your ruling planet Venus has now changed signs you
    need to focus on more personal relationships. Love is more important than labor.

    reason could be that you have got too close to the situation and need to step
    back a bit so you can see it from several angles. It’s still simple, if you know
    how to look.

    it falls to you to get their head straight again. Yes, give them a shoulder to
    cry on but get them to look at the situation logically as well – then tell them
    to get a grip!

    What a negative way of thinking! There is no reason at all why today, and tomorrow,
    should not be as good as, if not better than, all the days that went before. Be
    positive.
