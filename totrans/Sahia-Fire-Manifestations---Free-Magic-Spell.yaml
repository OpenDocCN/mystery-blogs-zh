- en: Here is where Sahia enjoys the game a little too much. Fires burning and raging
    out of control, now Sahia is in her element. She will manifest through raging
    infernos and kill by flame and smoke. She will take children and elderly first
    in her venting the wrath of her enslavement. She now knows the brutality of her
    master and the hatred with him to be summoning such evil. An heir is in sight.

- en: (1) The altar should face north. Place the altar bowl on the center of the altar.
    Place the yellow candle behind the altar bowl. The red candle goes in front of
    the altar bowl. Place the blue candle to the left and the green candle on the
    right side of the altar bowl. Place the athame on the right side of the altar.
    Place the white candles at the quarters around the ritual circle. Have a stool
    handy. Now it is time to step into the circle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (2) Stand tall and hold the athame high. Visualize the energy of the cosmos
    striking the athame and going into your body, charging you up. Fill yourself with
    this energy and hold it inside yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (3) Lower your arm so that the athame is pointing straight. Speak the line of
    incantation and draw in the energy of the element in that direction and light
    the candle on the altar in that same direction to the altar bowl. Turn clockwise
    to the next direction, do the same thing until you are back facing north.

- en: (4) Sit on the stool; close your eyes and just quiet your mind and allow your
    thoughts to go without paying attention to any one of them. Open your eyes and
    make the request for protection and once again quiet your mind and allow yourself
    to feel the presence of your guides and protectors.

    athame over your chest with your right hand. The blade should be pointing up.
    Once you feel their presence, it is time to light the candles around the circle,
    starting with the north going east, south and west.
