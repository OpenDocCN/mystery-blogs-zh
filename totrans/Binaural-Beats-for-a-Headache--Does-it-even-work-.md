# Binaural Beats for a Headache? Does it even work?

> 来源：[https://www.magickandwitchcraft.com/post/binaural-beats-for-headache-does-it-even-work#0001-01-01](https://www.magickandwitchcraft.com/post/binaural-beats-for-headache-does-it-even-work#0001-01-01)

Binaural beats may be a little bit of a digital relic, from long gone times of about 10 years ago, which, in internet time measures, is pretty much equal to a Trilobite fossil. Long before all the ASMR ambiences, lofi mixes with muffled music coming from another room while simultaneously raining outside and other oddly specific You-tube videos, Binaural Beats was all the hype and everybody was listening to some : binaural beats for focus, sleep, insomnia, headache, sinus infection {yes, for real} and we believed in almost miraculous power of monotonous sounds in weird pitch.

We know that binaural beats are meant to be a form of sound therapy, where listening to a slightly different tone frequencies between your left and right ear, should decrease anxiety levels, stress levels or increase focus.

The truth is, there are many different contradictory studies on this topic and no definite scientific answer if binaural beats are real or not. But there is also no scientific answer to many big questions including "Why Humans even exist?" which can be thankfully answered thanks to esoteric studies.

So to resolve this dilemma I decided to try the only thing I thought I could do. **I tried it on my myself, turning myself into a test guinea-piglet for binaural beats.** And my very empiric conclusion was : I am not sure. It seems to be doing something, but I am not sure what.

I had mild success with binaural beats for focus, some success with the ones for relaxation, I am not generally somebody with a lot of anxiety so I didn't try these, I had exceptional results with binaural beats for headache {I did not have a sinus infection for years, so I can't really testify to these either} and decent results with binaural beats for chakras.

Even-tough there seems to be no resolution to find out if binaural beats are real or not, it is undeniable that there are people who would swear by their results with their use, and you may be potentially one of them. If it works, don't fix it as they say. Scientific or not, I decided to share the one video here, that helped me the most, and that is the Binaural Beats for Headache, that worked at least for me, after listening to it for about 20 minutes with headphones. It may or may not work for you, but it may be worth giving it a shot. :}
