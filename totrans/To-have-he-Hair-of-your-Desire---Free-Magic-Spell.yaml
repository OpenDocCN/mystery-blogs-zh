- en: Midoriya is sort of correct. If you're dreaming of long pink hair to grow naturally
    from your head, no, this spell won't work. However, if you're hoping your hair
    will grow longer faster, then that's in the realm of possibility, but it won't
    be an instant thing. You might see an extra inch or two over the span of a month,
    but that's about it.
