I was hopeful about this one, but it's another flawed spell. You cannot become a mermaid, and if you wish to make a protection charm calling on mermaids that is fine, but this is not a working spell. You can take a necklace with a seashell, place it in salt water, and call on mermaids to bless the necklace to protect you from harm. You will not transform into a mermaid, no evil mermaids will be after you, and nothing bad will happen if you do not cast it correctly.
