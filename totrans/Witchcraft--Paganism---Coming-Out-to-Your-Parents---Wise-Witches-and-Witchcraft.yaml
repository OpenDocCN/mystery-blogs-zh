    faiths with your family. You may not feel wholly comfortable in this, but it’s
    absolutely vital in maintaining good relationships. See, coming to your parents
    honestly and openly shows thoughtfulness, consideration, maturity, and a sense
    of responsibility. Many parents are thrilled by that gesture, at least enough
    to open the door and make the conversation less tense.

    religious or spiritual choices. Hiding things or sneaking inspires distrust that
    could negatively shape your family’s opinion about Witches and Pagans for a very
    long time (making it all the harder for you in the days and years ahead).

    when connected with the word Witch) make a lot of people antsy, if not downright
    fearful. Most parents have a limited amount of knowledge about what those words
    really mean but for what they’ve heard in church or on TV. Their uncertain reaction
    is normal, but you have another disadvantage due to your age.

    not be seeing the whole picture, and you don’t have the advantage of extra years
    of life experiences to guide your choices. That doesn’t mean you’re necessarily
    going to make a “wrong” decision, but it’s a parent’s ethical duty to advise you
    as best they can, even if they disapprove.

    to carefully preserve. Family is very important, and while you might not always
    agree with your folks, and they may not always approve of all you do, that’s simply
    the way of things. If your parents set down rules, follow them. A discussion as
    to why you feel they’re unfair can always follow. Remember that magic is always
    with you even without crystals and wands. No one ever said that you had to plaster
    the word Witch on your bedroom door to maintain your beliefs, even if silently.

    Group B reflects a conservative lifestyle that may also include deep-seated faith.

    a meeting. Bring everything with you, including your convictions, and be ready
    to answer your family’s questions in a simple, respectful way. Remember, they
    may have odd ideas about Wicca being evil or that it’s some kind of cult, and
    you have to show them the positive influence metaphysical ideals can have on your

    living, environmentalism, etc. are all part of the Neo-Pagan play book

- en: Spiritual education is important to the Wiccan belief system. The Craft is not
    a shake-and-bake religion—it’s one that uses the mind that God/dess gave us to
    learn and grow. I.E., you are taking this seriously
  id: totrans-30

  zh: 精神教育对于巫教信仰体系至关重要。这不是一个摇摇晃晃的宗教——它是一个利用上帝/女神赋予我们的头脑来学习和成长的宗教。也就是说，你是认真对待这个的。
- en: This path provides a sense of self-confidence and improved control over one’s
    life (This is one of the things many people in your age-group lack.) When your
    parents say “be responsible” Wicca and Paganism agree!

  zh: 这条道路提供了自信和对自己生活的改善控制（这是你这个年龄段许多人缺乏的东西之一）。当你的父母说“要负责任”时，巫教和异教主义都同意！
- en: Speaking of being responsible, taking personal culpability for your actions,
    inactions, and choices are stressed. In all Neo-Pagan traditions, your life is
    what you make of it, and when you mess up—you clean up!

  zh: 谈到责任，强调对自己的行为、不作为和选择承担个人责任。在所有新异教传统中，你的生活取决于你自己，当你犯错时——你要自己清理！
- en: Attention is given to thinking before one acts (i.e., balancing our hearts and
    heads, and using the mind we’ve got for sound reasoning, even in matters of faith—
    or, perhaps more aptly, especially in matters of faith!). You haven’t just randomly
    “joined” Wicca or Paganism. It was a carefully considered decision.

- en: Just as a side note, this is not the time to wear black nail polish or ask about
    getting a piercing or a tattoo. You want to be taken seriously. Don’t add fuel
    to what could be a rather heated discussion. So, dress in something you know your
    parents like—not too fancy, but neat and somewhat professional. Appearances do
    mean a lot, and the way you look helps convey your sincerity.

  zh: 只是作为一个旁注，现在不是涂黑色指甲油、询问穿孔或纹身的时候。你想要被认真对待。不要给可能是激烈讨论的情况火上浇油。所以，穿上你知道父母喜欢的衣服——不要太花哨，但整洁而有些专业。外表确实很重要，你的外表有助于传达你的诚意。
- en: Now, some of you are already thinking—what if all this doesn’t work? What if
    they object to my studies and interest, or want to limit me in some way? First,
    try negotiating. For example, if your parents are worried about you burning candles
    and incense in your room because it’s a fire risk, try potpourri and dab aromatic
    oils on your lamp instead. That honors the house rules, shows responsibility with
    their request, and still accomplishes your goal.

  zh: 现在，你们中的一些人可能已经在想——如果这一切都不起作用怎么办？如果他们反对我的学习和兴趣，或者想以某种方式限制我？首先，尝试协商。例如，如果你的父母担心你在房间里点蜡烛和熏香会引发火灾风险，那么尝试用香包和在灯上涂抹芳香油。这尊重了家规，展示了对他们要求的责任感，并仍然实现了你的目标。
- en: Alternatively, if their objection is more deep-seated, perhaps you can work
    out a trade-off. Offer to attend church or special family functions (that you
    would otherwise avoid) with them. Or add a new chore into your household routine.
    In return, ask that they allow you a specific amount of time to devote to your
    spiritual interests.

- en: If both these approaches fail, the best advice is to honor your parents’ wishes
    (fall back on “Under this Roof”). You can certainly re-approach them in six or
    twelve months and try again (sometimes persistence pays off because it shows your
    interest wasn’t short-lived or a “fad”). You can also still read about the Craft
    at the library or talk about it with friends. But ultimately respecting your parents’
    decision in and around your home is the right thing to do, including from a Magickal
    perspective.

  zh: 如果这两种方法都失败了，最好的建议是尊重父母的意愿（回到“在这个屋檐下”）。你当然可以在六个或十二个月后重新与他们交涉并再次尝试（有时坚持会有回报，因为它表明你的兴趣不是短暂的或“时尚”）。你仍然可以在图书馆阅读有关女巫教的书籍或与朋友讨论。但从魔法的角度来看，尊重你父母在家中及周围的决定是正确的事情。

- en: Think of it this way—we talk about tolerance, love, and trust as keynotes to
    our beliefs. If you cannot give those things to the people who provide for and
    nurture you, how can you possibly hope to give it to anyone else? Also, anything

- en: See, being a Witch is more about who you are inside and how that affects the
    way you live your life than it is about all the bells and whistles, like spells.
    You can portray your ideals, and be the Magick, without waving it in people’s
    faces and making them uncomfortable. Living and thinking globally also includes
    your own home. Begin there, gently, and sensitively, and you will do just fine.

  zh: 看，成为一个女巫更多的是关于你内心是谁以及这如何影响你的生活方式，而不是所有的花哨和小道具，比如咒语。你可以展现你的理想，并成为魔法，而不是摇晃在人们面前让他们感到不舒服。全球思考和生活也包括你自己的家。从那里开始，温和地、敏感地，你会做得很好。
