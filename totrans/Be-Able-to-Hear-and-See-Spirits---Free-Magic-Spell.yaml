    Then on a flat surface, place the candles with the tall candle in the middle of
    the two small ones. If you are trying to reach bad spirits, now arm yourself with
    a cross and put salt around the candles.

- en: This spell is not going to work. Seeing or hearing spirits are abilities which
    need to be developed with practice. It is debated that one is born able to see
    spirits. I feel it can be developed and that spirits can choose whether to appear
    to someone. This spell isn't likely to work well. It offers no exercise to develop
    clairvoyance or clairaudience.
