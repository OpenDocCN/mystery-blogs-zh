- en: Violets and daffodils are beautiful flowers, and ones that I find popping up
    around my garden each spring. The violet and daffodil are flowers that I personally
    associate with love and loving energies, so it seems only fitting that they should
    be mentioned in spells for love.

- en: Gather together equal numbers of daffodils and violets. I usually gather between
    4 to 6 of each flower; just enough to make a small bouquet. Tie the flowers together
    with a pink ribbon and place them in a vase. Hold your hands over the flowers
    and (if you are giving them to an individual as a gift) visualize the flowers
    strengthening the bonds of love and friendship between the two of you, I would
    also suggest saying a small chant associated with your intent.

- en: If you are using the flowers for yourself, do the same, but simply visualize
    them vibrating with loving energy and drawing that energy to you, again you can
    say a small chant to cement your intent. You  can also dry the flowers, when they
    start to wilt, and carry them in a small, charm sachet to bring loving vibrations
    and energies to you.
