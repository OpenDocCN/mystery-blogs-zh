    If you have not yet thought it through then you need to, because what occurs over
    the next few months will help you turn dreams into realities. You must have a
    plan.

- en: You will need to deal swiftly and sternly with someone who tries to muscle in
    on your territory today. Don’t listen to their lies and excuses – make sure they
    know you are not amused and simply won’t stand for it. Be firm. In fact, be furious.

    your journey or a few dollars to your bill, so take them in your stride. And if
    something, or someone, goes out of your life, wave it, or them, a fond farewell.

    on too strong. The last thing you want is for others to see you as some kind of
    extremist. Sometimes the middle of the road is the safest place to be!

    Chances are they are talking fast in an effort to bamboozle you so you don’t see
    they have no real idea what they are going on about. Don’t be fooled.

    will be receptive to new ideas. Remember though that just because an idea is new
    does not mean it is good. Check, double check and then triple check all the facts.

    ability will soon see you are a force to be reckoned with – a force of nature
    no less!

    if people you have to deal with are deliberately obstructive. That will only inflame
    the situation. Stay calm and let them see you won’t be riled. The crisis will
    pass.

    problem bigger over time. The only way you are going to solve your current dilemma
    is by getting directly involved. Make it your mission to make things right.

    night today, and that’s good. The planets suggest that you need to be busy and
    you need to push yourself closer to your physical and emotional limits – though
    not beyond them!

    have to accept that not everyone is going to see things the same way as you. By
    all means be outspoken today but temper it with understanding and humility.
