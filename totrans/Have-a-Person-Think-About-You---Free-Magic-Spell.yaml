- en: This spell works over time. A relationship that grows slowly generally has more
    chance of success than a whirlwind romance and that is what is represented here.
    Small seeds represent the many facets of a relationship. The spell is done as
    the Moon is growing in power

    need nurturing so does love, so you will need to look after the growing seeds.

- en: It is said that the plants will grow and flourish if the love is meant to be,
    but will wither and die if there is no real energy in the relationship. For those
    who are not very good at plant-care, you might choose to put a reminder to nurture
    somewhere prominent.
