- en: If you are the type of person who loves Halloween, then you probably have some
    idea of the various rituals and traditions around the holiday, but what is Samhain?
    You are no doubt even aware that Halloween, sometimes referred to All Hallows
    Eve, came from an attempt by the Catholic Church to keep the peasantry happy by
    acknowledging one of their Harvest festivals. You may have even heard the term
    Samhain, and know that it has something to do with the original pagan holiday.

    there are a number of different traditions we rolled into All Hallows Eve, and
    not all of them came from Samhain. Not only that, but there are plenty of modern
    pagans who celebrate Samhain who do not necessarily celebrate it the same way
    as it was traditionally celebrated.

- en: Samhain is specifically a Celtic holiday, or so it is believed. It is known
    that there are many ruins and old structures in Ireland that are marked with traditional
    Samhain markings. It is also known that several traditions that became Halloween
    traditions were originally Irish traditions. A good example of this is the jack-o-lantern.
    The jack-o’-lantern started in the 19th century, and was believed to either represent
    evil spirits, or ward them off.

- en: Since the ancient Celts celebrated the turning of seasons as holy days, Samhain
    is considered one of the four major holidays of ancient Celts. It means that being
    a Harvest Festival, it was traditionally celebrated at the end of the Harvest
    before the coming of winter. It was a time to take stock of the larder and ensure
    that the cattle were properly cared for for the winter. It was also believed to
    be a day when the barrier between the physical world and the spirit world was
    particularly weak. This meant that spirits, such as ghosts and other supernatural
    beings that don’t quite fit into the category of ghost, were sometimes able to
    step between the worlds.

    strongly that was believed. It’s difficult to know precisely how large a part
    spirituality played in the everyday lives of ancient people. After all, in the
    modern day there are plenty of people who will claim some spiritual belief or
    another, but don’t really practice those beliefs with any regularity or determination.

    hearthfire from the bonfire, and using fall Harvest fruits as definition tools,
    are associated with warding off evil spirits. There were also traditions such
    as ritual sacrifices. Oftentimes a small animal such as a rooster would be sacrificed
    and then it’s blood would be trickle down the threshold of the family home.

- en: Of course, the fact that many of these traditions can also be associated with
    building a sense of community in order to ensure the village would have enough
    food for the winter, and warding off the cold in a way that allows the community
    to come together after what might have been a difficult harvest, indicates that
    many of these traditions may not have arose from the idea of spirits at all. Or,
    as with so many other religious and holiday traditions, they may have been both
    of those things at once.

  zh: 当然，许多这些传统活动也可以与建立社区意识相关联，以确保村庄在冬季有足够的食物，并在一次可能是艰难的收获之后驱散寒冷，这表明许多这些传统活动可能根本不是源于对精神的想法。或者，就像许多其他宗教和节日传统一样，它们可能同时具有这两种属性。

- en: Sometime during the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, traditional Samhain
    festival began to die out. Some communities still lit bonfires, and of course
    there was the need to choose which animals to slaughter and what to keep in the
    larder, but with the spread of the Catholic Church many Pagan traditions gave
    way to Catholic traditions.

  zh: 在18世纪末和19世纪初的某个时候，传统的萨温节庆典开始逐渐消失。一些社区仍然点燃篝火，当然也需要选择宰杀哪些动物以及在食品室中保留什么，但随着天主教会的传播，许多异教传统被天主教传统所取代。
- en: It was in the late 19th century that a man named Sir John Rhys begin to revive
    Samhain as a Celtic New Year. He took a great deal of information from the historical
    texts he could find, and from surrounding countries such as Wales and Scotland,
    and combined it into a somewhat more generalized New Year’s celebration. However,
    it was Sir James George Frazer who managed to popularize the festival. Not only
    that, but he was the man who put forth the idea that Samhain was the Celtic festival
    of the Dead. Even so, he did admit that the evidence was a bit sparse, due to
    both the age of the information and the fact that the monks who recorded it in
    writing tended to Christianize many of the names and activities.

- en: In the United States, as well as other countries that has picked up Wicca and
    other neo-pagan religions, Samhain is treated a bit eclectically. The specifics
    depend on precisely which branch of neo-paganism one follows. There are Celtic
    revivalists who attempt to follow the traditions as best they can based on the
    information available, there are neo-pagan Druids who take the idea of the traditions
    and attempt to translate them into modern life, and then there are Wiccans who
    consider it one of the most important Sabbats of the year.

  zh: 在美国以及其他接受女巫教和其他新异教宗教的国家，萨温节被视为一个略微混合的节日。具体情况取决于一个人究竟遵循哪一支新异教。有试图根据现有信息尽可能遵循传统的凯尔特复兴主义者，有将传统理念并尝试将其转化为现代生活的新异教德鲁伊，还有认为这是一年中最重要的萨巴特之一的女巫教徒。
- en: A Wiccan Sabbat is one of the seasonal holidays. Samhain fits very well into
    that. The reason it is deemed as being so important is that it is a time to celebrate
    the lives of those who have passed on, as well as celebrate the lives of those
    around you. Not only that, it is seen as the festival of darkness. This may sound
    sinister, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Wiccans believe in balance
    in all things. The balancing Sabbat of Samhain is Beltane, which is the festival
    of light. as such, Samhain being a festival of darkness is merely celebrating
    the fact that light and darkness have a balance, and the season continues to change.

  zh: '-   巫师节是季节性节日之一。萨温节非常适合其中。它被认为如此重要的原因是，这是一个庆祝已故者生命的时刻，同时也是庆祝身边人生命的时刻。不仅如此，它被视为黑暗的节日。这听起来可能有些不祥，但事实与此相去甚远。巫师们相信万物平衡。萨温节作为平衡节日的对应是贝尔塔尼，这是光明的节日。因此，萨温节作为黑暗的节日仅仅是在庆祝光明和黑暗的平衡，季节继续变化。'
- en: So what is Samhain? As you can see, while it is associated with Halloween it
    is not exactly the same thing. Halloween has become something of a marketing holiday,
    making it quite secular. Meanwhile, Samhain is much more religious and spiritual
    then secular. And now whenever any of your friends wonder “what is Samhain”, you
    have a ready answer for them.
