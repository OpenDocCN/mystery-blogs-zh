    circle. Place your four purple candles all around you, corresponding with north,
    south, east and west. Light your incense stick, placing the white candle right
    in front of you. Light all of the candles, then work on clearing your mind as
    you gaze into the flame coming from your white candle.

    forehead. This is the location where your innate psychic abilities are found.
    Work on absorbing the energy from the white candle while chanting the following:'

    what is unheard and seeing the unseen, psyching powers will be strong and keen.
    As I open up to see all through my third eye, this psychic bond to me I wish to
    tie. Unbind my spirit as well as my mind, so that my visions will no longer be
    confined. Allow my visions and dreams to come before the rising sun, as I cast
    let my will be done. My psychic powers, I invoke thee. It is done, so mote it
    be.”

    messages that you get in your dreams as soon as you wake. Even though they may
    be cryptic in the beginning, your psychic messages and visions will become a lot
    stronger in the days to come, especially if you are writing them down in a meticulous
    manner. Keep the notebook handy at all times.
