    white. Fill the tub up with hot water (as hot as you can stand to sit in). Add
    1 cup sea salt, 1 tablespoon sage, 1 tablespoon lavender and 1 tablespoon chamomile.
    Turn off the water and let the bath steep in the herbs. Kneel or sit in front
    of the tub, in the nude, and repeat this incantation:'

    the candles and go to sleep. By dawn the curse will be broken and you will once
    again find that feeling of "blessedness" that you lost.

    a tea. As the water cools, charge it with energy. When the water has cooled to
    a safe level, step in and soak in the water, imagining negative energy being washed
    off your skin and sitting like tar on top of the water. As you soak, say the chant
    and imagine a protective light of positive energy filling your body. When you
    feel ready, pull the plug, leave the tub, and put on fresh clothes.
