    it within some kind of containment. Calm and reassure the animal. Bring it to
    a calm state where it can sit comfortably. Take both acorns and two lengths of
    thread. Tie each thread so the acorn hangs in the middle, then tie one around
    your neck. Trim the other to size and tie around the animal's neck. Calm it down.
    If it flips out, your spell cannot be repeated for a year, so be careful!

    soul. Imagine the acorn necklaces giving you and the animal power and longevity
    while also streaming back the souls so you each are completed by each other. The
    maple wood gives you life and bonds you eternally. Now light the green candle.

    Wear your acorn for a week. If the animal is fine with wearing it, make them wear
    it for a week. At the end of the week, come together with the animal again. If
    the animal isn't wearing the acorn necklace, put it on them again. Bring out the
    flower cup, hold the quartz and repeat the final chant* three times. Now, take
    off the necklaces. Bury them with the quartz in a place important to you. You
    may want to consider going to your hometown or the house you grew up in, or even
    your childhood climbing tree. Remove the flowerheads and bury them with the rest.
    Pour the water over it. The candles should be snuffed and buried in front of your
    current residence.

    the animal will run away in the middle of the spell. If they don't abandon you,
    they will probably hate you. Using man-made food may prevent you from forming
    the bond. Reading from a printout of this page is a good idea, as flubbing up
    the spell counts as failing it. Side effects may include being awake when your
    animal is and being tired when your animal sleeps, being hungry when they are,
    gaining their taste for food, etc.
