After reading your type of Witch from the quiz, you may say AH HA! That is truly what type of Witch I am. Or you may still be fuzzy. If you’re not sure, that’s perfectly ok. The outset of this quiz is just a small part of your magical journey.

Remember, you were able to take the “What Type of Witch Are you” quiz in the privacy of your home without curious eyes. So relax and try not to make things more complex than they need be. There is really no such thing as cookie-cutter Witchcraft. We, like a room full of black cats, are all too stubbornly individualistic for that!

If you find yourself stewing in this uncertain cauldron, perhaps take a peek at some of the other Witch’s listed and see if they fit you better. A common mistake made when people get excited about something is marrying themselves to the first thing they find. Witchcraft practices shouldn’t be like that. You are exploring what kind of Witch are you. Take your time. You will know for sure over time and it will be clear as a bell, book and candle!

On the other hand should your wand light up merrily and you feel you have absolutely answered the question “what type of Witch are you” it wouldn’t hurt to meditate on that awareness for a while. Let it gently settle into your spirit. Affirm your choice out loud, if you wish. Speech and hearing are two senses that transform the energy in our aura, aiding in manifestation. Think of this like trying on a new pair of new ruby slippers. Sometimes you need to walk a few steps before finding that comfort zone.

What next? Well, gather up your broomstick and other tools that you’ll need for your spells and rituals. You don’t have to do this all at once (hey, we all have a budget), and obviously, the items change depending on the type of Witch the quiz revealed. Also, remember that a lot of a Witch’s tools can often be found in and around the home, like herbs and spices in your pantry. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using those items. If anything they already resonate with your personal energy making them even more effective.

While you are wandering around in New Age and Witchy shops for your gadgets you can multitask – do some networking too. Mix, mingle, talk to people. Ask questions. Reach out and see if you can find others that are the same type of Witch you are, or those who simply enjoy the company of other people of a like mind.

Egads! Just because you decide you are a Solitary Witch doesn’t mean you can’t hang with a Kitchen Witch periodically. Take off your pointy hat and start out simple. If anything you’ll find surprising commonalities and probably get some grand ideas through the exchange (and perhaps make a long-term friend in the process).

Now there is the process of figuratively “bagging it up” and taking home all the wonderful goodies you’ve discovered. As you take each new magical piece out, determine where it should live in your sacred space of home. Perhaps you want to set up an altar specifically for your tools. Perhaps you want them scattered about as decorative touches that make you smile wherever you look. Trust your instincts in terms of fitting together everything like an energetic puzzle. You will probably rearrange them several times anyway before you’re happy.

Finally, it’s always good to keep a magical journal that follows your exploration and growth in Witchcraft. You can keep this separate or add it to your Witch’s spell book (or Grimoire) when you create one. Go back and read this from time to time just to see if you get even more insights out of your experiences. Page by page you can literally witness personal improvements and celebrate them. Where there’s a Witch there’s a way.****
