    to remember to take down the circle. Never leave the energy you have raised hanging.

- en: 'Begin this at the east of your already cast circle. Point with your wand, athame,
    or pointer finger at the eastern candle, and call out: "Farewell, Air, Guardian
    of the East. You are now dismissed." Draw a pentacle above the Air candle (this
    is saluting it) and extinguish it with the snuffer. Never just blow out your candles.
    This is considered bad luck.'

    or index finger and recite: "Farewell, Fire, Guardian of the South. You are now
    dismissed." Salute the element, and extinguish the candle.'

- en: Do likewise for the remaining elements in your circle until all the candles
    are out. Then, you are free to go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Feel free to be creative with these two spells! Write your own chants for when
    you invoke and dismiss the elements, or maybe even write certain chants for special
    occasions like holidays, sabbats, and such. You don't always have to use candles
    to represent the elements, I just prefer to. Some people use a wand, a feather,
    or incense for Air, a star or perhaps a piece of charcoal for Fire, a bowl of
    water for Water, a stone or a bowl of salt for Earth, and a statue or picture
    of a deity for Spirit. Feel free to get creative and personalize your own circle
    casting. This is your practice. Don't feel pressured to imitate others.
