- en: Have you ever seen someone, in person, with physical angel wings? Magic is a
    natural force that brings natural change to the natural world. Humans bones are
    nothing like bird bones, they are too tick while birds are hollow, and we lack
    the joints cabable for winged flight, therefore this spell does not work.

    \ who\x92ve succeeded in spells like these"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have not, as Tadashi said it's not possible through magick or nature. Human
    bones and bird bones are completely different, we don't have the joints required
    for wings, and above all just saying ''I saw someone'' isn't proof. Those of us
    explaining real magick to you have provided proof and explained why pretty clearly,
    you simply going ''no, I saw it'' doesn't prove anything.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tadashi and Nekoshema is absolutely correct. Sorry darlings, but witches are
    humans and we can't change that. The human anatomy and bird anatomy are completely
    different, as Nekoshema said. Magick isn't like the magick you see in shows and
    movies, it requires studying and such. And magick stills applies to science
