    \ stream. Next, send the image into the crystal by pulsing the breath out of your\
    \ nose at the same time you send the image into the crystal. Repeat this process\
    \ three times for the best results. Now, imagine a magnificent healing flower\
    \ opening up in your mind\x92s eye. At the mement the flower fully opens, use\
    \ your breath to pulse the image into the amethyst. Repeat this process three\
    \ times."

- en: Place the amethyst crystal into the bottle of oil and leave it there. Anoint
    yourself with the oil after dark whenever you like. Anytime you have a chance,
    place the bottle of oil in a place where it can absorb moonlight. This will strengthen
    the healing effects of the oil. When you do this, ask for the help of a moon goddess.
    Use the oil within a couple of weeks for best results.

    before anointing your skin. You could also place some in a tiny vile and carry
    it for the same effect.

- en: Very specific item,notes,instruction. Also the author also give the source of
    this Spell. the instruction 'repeat this process 3 times' (very good) is same
    like 'mountain move' in ''Gospel of Thomas'' (from ''deadsea scrools'' in ''nag
    hammadi'', and not from these day bible), repeated 3 times in the book, because
    it is the most powerfull sentences in that book. even Tesla the inventor rumored
    circling a building 3 times before entering it.
