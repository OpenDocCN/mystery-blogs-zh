- en: Voynich manuscript is often called, the most mysterious text of all times. It
    has been written in coded language, which is yet to be de-code. It is also filled
    with symbolism and illustrations, we are also yet to understand.

    loving emperor Rudolf II. We know its story from this point onward with good precision,
    we have an account of all the people throughout the centuries, who spent their
    lives and money trying to decode it. However, the fact that is such a mysterious
    text, may be a challenge for a code-breakers but it also makes it a blessing for
    training psychic abilities and clairvoyance!

    **Meditation on unknown symbol - a Secrets Revealing Meditation**.It is designed
    as a practice to enhance clairvoyance, but a great advice and knowledge can be
    obtained through it too.

    concentrate on it. Breath deeply, and keep you mind empty - apart from the symbol
    you are focusing on. It may take over 5 to 10 minutes of breathing and focusing,
    don't be afraid to take your time. Especially rationally minded people will have
    the tendency to rationalize the symbol ‚Äì ‚Äúthis could be this‚Äù , ‚Äúthis could be
    that‚Äù‚Ä¶ forget about reason, just let the symbol trigger visions and embrace irrationality,
    that it will bring ‚Äì if you will follow the flow of the visions you will most
    likely find something interesting at the end. üôÇ

    Keep focusing on the symbol, than look away for a short moment and the look quickly
    back. Notice what was naturally the first thought that came into your mind after
    looking back at it.'
