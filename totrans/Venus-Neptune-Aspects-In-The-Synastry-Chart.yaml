    is that neither person can *really* see what’s true. It’s as though there’s a
    wall blocking each person from reality.

- en: The only way this relationship can work is if both partners are ready (at some
    point as the journey isn’t instantaneous) to reveal the dark parts of their soul.
    This won’t feel good at first. Much like breaking an addiction, both people will *want*
    to get more of the “good” feelings in the relationship.
