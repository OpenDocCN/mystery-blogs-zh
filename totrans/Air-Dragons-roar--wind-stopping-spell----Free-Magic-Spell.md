it might grant you some favour with an air Dragon, but controlling the weather would involve a lot more than just asking nicely for the wind to die down a bit.

Unless you work with the air element or dragons, this will not work. As outlined, you only need ''belief'' which leads me to conclude this is fake. You did not put any Magik into it. You are simply saying works once and hoping for the best. If this works, it would be a placebo.

This I think might work because I did a spell the other day to cause a gust of wind and now almost any time I leave the house the wind picks up so this might work if you ad magik to it.
