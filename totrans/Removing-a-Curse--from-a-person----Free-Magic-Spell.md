# Removing a Curse (from a person)

This ritual will help remove hexes, curses and negative influences on body, mind and soul. (Important note: Dont try to use this ritual in the case of a Blood Curse because it won't work to remove a blood curse, if this indeed does not work then please mail me or someone else that is experienced, so they can research the curse and give you the proper instructions to remove said curse. WARNING I do not recommend attempting to remove a blood curse without supervision or help from an expert.)

Click on their username, then click on the mail tab located in the upper right corner of their profile. As for your current predicament, what spell exactly was used? Blood Magik is not inherently evil, so saying ''blood curse'' would mean the caster used some of your blood, or you cast a curse using your own blood. Blood personalizes the spell to the person, so unless your blood was used, this would not be the result of the spell/curse. The majority of curses in my experience are the result of your own fear charging your person with negative energy thus resulting in cursing yourself. Similar to worrying yourself sick. All of this is a round about way of saying, unless we know the exact spell, we can only give generic options to remove it. Cleanse yourself and your home, then ward and protect yourself and your home. There are a plethora of ways to do this, but I do not wish to take up too much space in the comment section. Once you cleanse and protect, the most important thing is to raise your vibration. If you stay in a scared low vibration, the negative energy will return and continue to plague you. You need to create a daily routine to bring positive energy in. A daily blessing, an affirmation, meditation, shielding. Focus on things that bring you joy, this will charge positive energy and help prevent negative energy from returning. You may need to cleanse and protect more frequently at first.
