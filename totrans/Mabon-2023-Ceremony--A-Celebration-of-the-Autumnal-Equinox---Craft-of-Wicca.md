Mabon is a time of celebration and thanksgiving. It is right around the corner. Mabon 2023 is on September 22, 2023\. For other Wheel of the Year dates, check out my article on the [Wiccan Wheel of the Year](https://craftofwicca.com/wiccan-holidays-wheel-of-the-year-explained/).

 It marks the autumnal equinox, a time when the days and nights are of equal length. It is a time of balance, when the bounty of the summer sun is starting to give way to the darkness of winter.

Mabon is a time to celebrate the harvest and give thanks for the season’s blessings. It is a time to come together with friends and family, feast on the fruits of the earth, and hail the onset of winter.

 I know many Wiccans love Samhain and Beltane, but my favorite holiday is Mabon because of that feeling you get as the weather turns a touch cooler and the colors of the leaves changing makes its own magic.

The Mabon ceremony is an important part of the Pagan tradition. Here we will share some tips on celebrating Mabon in your own home.

 ## What Is Mabon?

Mabon is a Pagan ceremony that celebrates the autumnal equinox. It is a time to give thanks for the harvest and to celebrate the autumn season.

 The ceremony typically includes a feast, prayers, and rituals that honor the gods and goddesses of the harvest. It is a time of transition, as the days grow shorter and the nights grow longer.

 Mabon is a time of mystery and magic, a time to celebrate the change of seasons and the bounty of nature.

### The History of Mabon

The Bavarians started a holiday that begins the final week of September in the 1700s, which we now know as Oktoberfest. There was a lot of food and celebration at the event. In modern-day Bavaria, Oktoberfest is still a holiday.

 Any culture with a deep connection to crops, farming, and the cycles of nature has some form of harvest festival around this time of year.

 It is a time to give thanks for the harvest and to honor the cycle of life and death, and each culture had its own view of gods or goddesses involved in a successful harvest season.

The ceremony is traditionally held on or near the Autumnal Equinox, which falls on September 22nd. Of course, before modern-day science, the exact date of the equinox wasn’t known.

 Mabon is one of the four major Sabbats celebrated by Wiccans and Pagans. It is a time of harvest, reflection, and thanksgiving.

 The Welsh God, the son of the Earth Mother Goddess, is where the term ***Mabon*** originates. The event was not originally a Celtic celebration, as evidenced by the fact that the term was only used in the 1970s.

## How to Celebrate Mabon 2023

To celebrate Mabon 2023, you can gather with your friends and family to honor the harvest. There are many ways to celebrate, but here are a few suggestions:

 *   Make a ritual to honor the changing of the seasons (described below).
*   Make a corn dolly, which is a traditional symbol of harvest.
*   Make an autumnal altar and decorate it with fruits and vegetables of the season.
*   Hold a feast to celebrate the bounty of the harvest.
*   Make a cornucopia to symbolize the harvest.
*   Sing harvest songs.
*   Read poems about autumn.
*   Make a quilt or afghan as a tribute to the harvest season.
*   Eat foods that are associated with autumn, such as apples, pears, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and squash.

Let’s look at a few more of these in depth. A full ceremony/ritual is given later.

 ### Cornucopia

The cornucopia is a symbol of abundance and prosperity. It is a common decoration for harvest festivals like Thanksgiving, Mabon, and Christmas.

The cornucopia is an ancient symbol of plenty dating back to at least the Classical period. It was always filled with fruits, vegetables, grain, and other foodstuffs that were associated with the Earth’s bounty. In modern times it has been filled with gifts like toys or wrapped chocolate candies.

The basket can be found at any general purpose store around this time, or just repurpose a basket you already have.

 ### Corn Dolly

The corn dolly is a harvest decoration made of corn stalks. The stalks are woven together and adorned with fruits, vegetables, and other products to create a decorative figure.

Materials:

 *   Corn husks (available at most grocery stores)
*   String or twine
*   A long stick or piece of wire
*   Scissors
*   Vegetables, fruits, and other produce
*   A bowl of water

*   Apple Pie
*   Pumpkin Pie
*   Squash Soup

I won’t go into recipes because this isn’t a cooking site and everyone’s tastes are different.

 ## Mabon Ceremony Script

The following is a sample script for a Mabon ceremony. Feel free to adapt it to suit your needs.

For this you will need:

 *   Kernels of corn
*   Red clothing
*   A red or orange candle

If this is going to be more religious in nature, you can use your [Wiccan altar](https://craftofwicca.com/wiccan-altar-set-up-for-beginners/), otherwise, you will need a place for the candle to rest.

 Begin the ceremony just as the sun is setting.

Stand outside and face West, toward the setting sun and wear any small bit of red that you have.

 Say:

 > Welcome! We are gathered here today to celebrate the autumnal equinox and the harvest season.
> 
> This is a time of change, a time when the days grow shorter and the nights grow longer. It is a time of introspection and reflection, a time to honor the past and prepare for the future.
> 
> The harvest is a time of abundance, a time to give thanks for all that we have been given. It is also a time of contraction, a time when we must prepare for the coming winter.
> 
> Mabon, Child of Light, and the son of the Earth Mother Goddess, we thank thee for this bounty.

Now toss the kernels of corn out in front of you as an offering.

Continue:

> So let us celebrate this harvest, and remember that all things must come to an end. Let us look forward to the new adventures that await us in the months ahead.
> 
> Just as the sun now sets and changes light to dark, the seasons will change from light to dark. Protect us and guide us with this light.

Now light the candle and let it burn until the sun has completely set.

 Remember to hold a positive intention and reflect on what this summer has brought you up to this point. Ceremonies and rituals are as much an internal spiritual practice as they are an outward expression of gratitude.

The Mabon 2023 Ceremony is an opportunity to celebrate the autumnal equinox and all that the season has to offer. It’s a time for gathering with loved ones, enjoying the harvest, and taking a moment to reflect on the year that has passed.
