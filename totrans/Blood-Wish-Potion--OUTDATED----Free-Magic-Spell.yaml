- en: I highly recommend you do not use this wish potion for things like people to
    get hexed or hurt, it's really likely to backfire and the outcome will land on
    you. Oh and most importantly... Be careful what you wish for. The effects of this
    ritual are permanent and can't be reversed.

    to bless the ritual to work.. Step 1: gather your ingredients Step 2: add water,
    honey and mix the components together clockwise Step 3: after doing mixing, take
    your hands around the mortar and draw energy from yourself (only good and positive
    energy) and bring it into the mixture. You may think about what you want Step
    4: while bringing energy, say the following incantation ~Wishes all And wishes
    one What I ask for May it be done All I wish for May it please come true Here
    is an offering just for you~ Step 5: quickly add a drop of blood to the potion
    and mix it while still thinking about your wish Step 6: after done mixing, drink
    all of the potion quickly as if the blood will become toxic as your wish will
    become toxic as well. -Depending on what you wished for it can come true in either
    hours, days, weeks, or even maybe years... just be patient- If you attempt this
    ritual, email me your results~'

    you cannot say a chant and wake up a model, but you can say a chant, the energy
    shifts, and you have an easier time sticking to and achieving your goal.'

- en: i'm confused as to the nature of this, is it a blessing or curse? i can't tell,
    if it's a positive spell why bring up the blood making the potion toxic, if it's
    a curse the ingredients don't work with the intended energy. if it works for you
    i'm happy, but this whole thing seems flawed to me.

- en: This spell is a bit wonky as I have made it during a phase of mine ! not bad
    for you to think of it as flawed but it has worked, I may need to change a few
    things though lol
  prefs: []

- en: With a bit of tweaking I could see this working for some cases, but the blood
    is a dangerous addition. Drinking blood is never a good idea, even just a drop
    of it. A drop wouldn't kill you or anything, but it could make someone sick, and
    if someone cast the spell often it could quickly become dangerous.

    with the blood tbh

- en: Yes, I'm certainly passing no judgement on the blood, as I did similar things
    when I was younger lol, and because you seem receptive and understanding about
    criticism, which is great. I just wanted to point it out in case someone younger
    came along and thought it would be a good idea to drink a bunch of blood for a
    spell. I think the blood could certainly be helpful in connecting the wish to
    oneself as long as drinking it wasn't involved lol.
