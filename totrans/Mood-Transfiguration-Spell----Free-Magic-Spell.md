**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A wand or just your eyes.

To cast this spell, you must wave your wand around in the air or just stare at the person and as you do that, you say: ''This (say the emotion that they currently are here.) kid is now not. (A/An) (say the emotion you want them to be here.) kid shall fill their spot.'' Then, just stop staring at them or point your wand at them. P.S. This is not a spell from Wizards of waverly place! It really works and it is entirely different from the wizards of waverly place spell!
