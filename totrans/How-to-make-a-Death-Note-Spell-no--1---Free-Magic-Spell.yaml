    deadly and have consequences unimaginable for the foolish and dabbling. Make sure
    you have enough magickal experience before trying this.

    for some people. In English, I would advise you to write in Drow or other transliterate
    language in English since only you can translate it unless some religious freak
    or a pig (anarchist slang for cop or a detective cop) gets a hold of it.)

    type in the font of your choosing as long as no one reads it.'

    you've printed off. I prefer spit since it doesn't get you into trouble with the
    psych police and you can easily disguise it into your dragon's blood ink available
    from many occult stores. I have this ink since I have been involved with the occult
    in my life and let me tell you, it works like real blood when you combine menses,
    spit, or blood in it.

    the lord your god,'' ''Will of god will be obeyed'', or ''Sword of God's will''.
    Or put the word Goddess or God/dess or even Satan in it by dipping it in ink and
    writing in the language of your choice.

    say, ''By the powers of Darkness, I ask this book to kill those with names written
    into it. By the darkness and might, I summon the angel of death (or Shinigami)
    to activate this book in pure darkness.'' Then meditate while the candles burn
    down before snuffing them. Let the darkness get sucked into the book and turn
    darkest greyish black.

- en: You cannot make a death note with Real Magic. What you are referring to is a
    work of fiction. The anime is not a documentary. While you can charge a pen and
    paper with energy and write your intention and it manifests, death requires more
    energy, and one cannot write down a name and they die.

    not everyone believes in heaven and hell. Research, soul search, and discover
    the answer that resonates with you.
