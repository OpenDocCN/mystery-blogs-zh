    you may think that is the case but it isn’t. The fact is you have all the time
    in the world, so relax and take each day as it comes. Enjoy life, don’t rush it.

    choice in the matter. Instead of trying to fight the future why not find ways
    to make it your friend? Don’t let your fear of change stop you from acting decisively.

    but what is your evidence for that assumption? Most likely the facts have not
    changed in the slightest – you have just become a lot more suspicious. Get over
    it.

    don’t worry in the slightest how many people get upset by it. You cannot keep
    your mouth shut when there are so many injustices going on in the world around
    you.

    an entirely comfortable experience. It’s good to be popular but may not be quite
    so good when there are things you would rather not have the spotlight shining
    on!

    suddenly gets tougher over the next few days – that’s exactly what you need.

    If you do get involved you may find it impossible to break free again. Other people’s
    problems are for them to deal with and learn from. You’ve got enough of your own.

    say sounds false or not quite right. Just because they claim to know what they
    are talking about does not give them immunity from criticism. Their “facts” may
    not be facts at all.

    must be no cutting corners and no using dubious measures. If you leave yourself
    open to charges of dishonesty your rivals will seize on that to make you look
    bad.

    on with what you are doing quietly and calmly and stay under the radar as much
