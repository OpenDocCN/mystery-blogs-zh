- en: Is time running out? Do you have to act right now? Your birthday chart indicates
    you may think that is the case but it isn’t. The fact is you have all the time
    in the world, so relax and take each day as it comes. Enjoy life, don’t rush it.

- en: You may not want to move with the times but the planets indicate you have no
    choice in the matter. Instead of trying to fight the future why not find ways
    to make it your friend? Don’t let your fear of change stop you from acting decisively.

- en: You seem to have got it into your head that a friend can no longer be trusted,
    but what is your evidence for that assumption? Most likely the facts have not
    changed in the slightest – you have just become a lot more suspicious. Get over
    it.

- en: Speak your mind fearlessly today. Stir things up both at home and at work and
    don’t worry in the slightest how many people get upset by it. You cannot keep
    your mouth shut when there are so many injustices going on in the world around
    you.

    an entirely comfortable experience. It’s good to be popular but may not be quite
    so good when there are things you would rather not have the spotlight shining
    on!

    currently moving at a pace that is far too easy for you. Don’t complain if life
    suddenly gets tougher over the next few days – that’s exactly what you need.

- en: You must not allow yourself to get dragged into other people’s private affairs.
    If you do get involved you may find it impossible to break free again. Other people’s
    problems are for them to deal with and learn from. You’ve got enough of your own.

- en: By all means question what other people tell you today, especially if what they
    say sounds false or not quite right. Just because they claim to know what they
    are talking about does not give them immunity from criticism. Their “facts” may
    not be facts at all.

    must be no cutting corners and no using dubious measures. If you leave yourself
    open to charges of dishonesty your rivals will seize on that to make you look
    bad.

- en: Try not to call attention to yourself today, either at home or at work. Get
    on with what you are doing quietly and calmly and stay under the radar as much
    as possible while doing it. You don’t need recognition, you need to be left alone.

    calm and not be panicked will win you plenty of admirers. Maybe you should ask
    yourself though where the pressure came from. Chances are you brought it on yourself.

    but maybe that’s no bad thing. Every now and again it’s good to remind those you
    deal with, at home and at work, that you will never be one to follow the crowd.

    that nothing happens in a vacuum. Consequences don’t come out of nowhere – they
    always have causes, and your task now is to uncover the root of your current dilemma.
