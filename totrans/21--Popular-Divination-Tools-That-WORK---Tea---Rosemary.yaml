- en: Divination has been around for thousands of years. At least, that’s how long
    we have been actively recording divination practices. Divination tools have been
    around just as long. Since the beginning of the occult, practitioners have used
    tools to gain answers to their questions from spirits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hundreds of years ago, witches and seers used to “see” using divination tools
    such as bone reading and entail reading. Obviously, these methods are not super
    popular anymore. Divination tools have evolved over time, and even though they
    look a little different, there are still *many* popular divination tools out there
    today that work.

    already use some of these divination tools or they may be completely unfamiliar
    to you.

    to clear my divination tools, but you can also use sage, sound, the sun, the moon,
    or visualization techniques.'

    that you don’t have any different energy influencing your answers. The only way
    to get a valid reason is to clear your tools first!

    use! Using the pendulum is the act of *dowsing*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    pendulums on Amazon](https://rstyle.me/+ImbsBEmjUrHeSREyoRoX3A)), but it’s very
    easy to [clear your pendulum](https://teaandrosemary.com/cleanse-pendulum/) once

    using my pendulum with charts.
  prefs: []

    want to make your own pendulum using a rock and string, or you can use a necklace.
    I prefer purchasing a pendulum because it’s made to swing equally in all directions,
    but this is simply a personal preference.

    Although Tarot cards are a bit difficult to use at first, I really love Tarot
    and do recommend putting in the time to learn these divination tools if you’re
    interested.

    reading that is geared towards soul growth.

    cards are one of the newer divination tools on the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for each card with slightly different photos. Oracle Cards are instead made in
    any way the creator wishes. No one deck is like another in *any* way.
  prefs: []

    one place and choose what deck I’ll use for a reading based on intuition.

    effective. The pen is best used during automatic writing sessions.
  prefs: []

    a piece of paper, and a quiet place to sit. [Check out this post for instructions](https://teaandrosemary.com/5-easy-exercises-to-develop-strong-claircognizance/)

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the Ouija board is often viewed with fear, I find that it is simply
    another divination tool. You may need to add some extra protection when you’re
    working with an Ouija board, but you can certainly connect to positive spirits
    and receive insightful answers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do recommend [purchasing a brand new Ouija board](https://rstyle.me/+0XL5mh9-etrkWXUFkG2_vA)
    instead of using one that has entities attached to it. You’ll need to clear the
    board and cast a circle in order to keep out negative spirits.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    such as a crystal ball. You can also scry using water, a mirror, a spoon, or anything
    else that is either transparent or has a reflection.'
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The candle isn’t often though of as a divination tool, but it works quite well.
    You can scry into the candle flame if you want to practice clairvoyance. Alternatively,
    you can speak aloud (about any topic) and interpret the bounce and height of the
    candle flame as your answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I often incorporate candle divination into my spell work. If a candle flame
    is strong, I assume that my spell has a good amount of energy. If the candle is
    going wild, that’s an indication that something is off with the spell. If the
    candle flame is weak, I usually know to gather *more* energy in order to cast
    a spell successfully.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tool, but that’s probably because it *works.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I love doing a small tea leaf reading for myself at night. To practice tea leaf
    reading you’ll need a tea cup, a saucer, a kettle, and loose leaf tea.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Drink the tea until there are only a few drops left in the bottom, the flip
    the cup over so that the loose leaf tea has a chance to move about and stick to
    the side. Flip the cup back over and observe what patterns you see in the leaves.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Table turning was super popular in the Victorian times, probably because you
    only need a table. Similar to the Ouija board, table turning got a bad rap, but
    it’s really just another one of the many divination tools that we use to get answers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea is that the energy of the group (sitting around the table) and the
    energy specifically coming from their hands (resting on the table) gives the spirits
    power to tip the table. You can ask a question then say various letters or answers.
    When the table tips to one side, this is indicative of an answer from the spirits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although table turning isn’t super popular nowadays, it is a super fun group
    activity for a spiritual community to try, similar to the Ouija board. Make sure
    to [cast a circle](https://teaandrosemary.com/how-to-cast-a-circle/) or at least
    cast some type of protection barrier before beginning.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Astrology is one of my all-time favorite divination tools. It isn’t so much
    a physical divination tool as it is an art. I use physical charts for the purpose
    of astrology, but most of the answers in astrology come from learning, studying,
    and intuiting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can take quite a bit of time to learn astrology, but I really feel that it’s
    worth it. Astrology is (*in my opinion)* one of the most accurate divination tools
    on this list. It’s a comprehensive science/art that you’ll start to see in every
    area of your life.
  prefs: []

    can use a plain old bowl of water!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll want to use the same method you would use with a crystal ball. Let your
    eyes fuzz out and spend a few moments getting into a deep trance while focusing
    on the water. Over time, images will reveal themselves to you.

    don’t know the full language of runes (most of us don’t), it’s much simpler to
    use wooden runes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    answer you received.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    divination tools. I typically use playing cards for numerical questions, but you
    can really use them any way you like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want more than just numerical answers, you can assign values or meanings
    to each of the playing cards. Alternatively, you can pair each playing card up
    with a Tarot card definition. This is pretty easy because there are 4 Tarot suits
    that coincide with playing card suits.

    You may already own crystals and not realize that they can function as divination
    tools!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or place crystals on your chakras. Alternatively, you can scry using a crystal,
    as long as it’s slightly see-through or milky. Some of my best scrying sessions
    have been while using a crystal!
  prefs: []

    specific crystals for specific purposes. Don’t forget to bond with your crystal
    before using it.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use regular dice as divination tools! Most of us already own dice, so
    this is an easy way to practice divination without spending any money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For very basic questions, an even number is a yes and an odd number is a no.
    It can be helpful to use multiple dice at once to get clearer answers. If the
    dice are split (one is even while one is odd) then the answer is unclear or unknown.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also ask numerical questions to the dice and gain insightful answers.
    For example, you could ask how many minutes would be most beneficial for your
    body to workout or other health-related questions. I also like using the dice
    for time-related questions.

    as the incense burns.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I do recommend scrying into the mirror when it’s somewhat dark so that you can
    *see* more easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many ways to scry into a mirror; there really are no rules. You can
    ask a question and wait to receive the answer visually, or you can see what comes
    up. Sometimes, I even ask to see a past life in the mirror.
  prefs: []

    tools. I believe that the mind is *the* primary divination tool. As much fun as
    it can be to use various tools and methods, psychism begins within us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tools. It’s certainly fun to play around and you can get many great answers from
    divination tools, but at the end of the day, the answers are always within.
