# Get Money (powerful, but dangerous one)

  Rated 5/5 Stars

this spell can get you a pile of money, however please cast with care- if not experienced/careful enough, it may get you the cash in a huge backfire way, for example a relative dieing. this is a long-term based spell, and may take some time to have effect (several days/weeks to months, based on how powerful it is)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Get Money (powerful, but dangerous one)'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   a quit place to concentrate

*   a clear mind on what you want.

*   piece of paper(may be ripped of as small piece)

*   pen/pencil

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   a quit place to concentrate

*   a clear mind on what you want.

*   piece of paper(may be ripped of as small piece)

*   pen/pencil

first off all, concentrate you on money, and get a clear mind on what you want to do with it, or how you will live with it.

then, draw a pentragram on the piece of paper before you, and say this:

''water, fire, air, earth, and the spirit of all, the elements of luck and existence, combine your powers, let my wish be my fate. for i wish to get a grip on whealth. for my desire is (put a small brief desire here). please let my wish be my fate..''

then imagine the elements, going away from you to go on a journey to haul that for you.

as i said, this spell is dangerous and very powerfull, and if not cast carefully, this can cause great consequences. however if you think out clear what you want, in such a way you hold the harm outside, this spell can't do any much backfire. i recommended intermediate and higher levels to cast this.

why this spell is dangerous ?

Hello, can I use protection spell for the backfire?

Technically, yes. You should have protections in place [wards, shielding, protection charms, sigils so on] so you won't need to cast in addition to this spell. Personally, I've maybe had 1 spell backfire in my almost 16 years of practice, so don't worry too much. Look into a daily shielding practice, should protect you in case this spell backfires, but I wouldn't worry about it, because the doubt could lead to negative consequences.
