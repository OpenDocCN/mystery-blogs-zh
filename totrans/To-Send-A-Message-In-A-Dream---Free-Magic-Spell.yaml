    \ would still like to prepare the candle in some way, you can carve symbols or\
    \ words that represent sleep or dreams into the wax, or ones that are relevant\
    \ to the message you are sending. You can also carve the person\x92s name into\
    \ the candle. And, of course, you can both carve and anoint the candle if you\
    \ wish. Light the candle and gaze at it, focusing on your message and intentions.\
    \ Then prepare for burning the herbs. If you are burning them as loose incense,\
    \ light a charcoal disk (use a pair of metal tongs) by the candle\x92s flame and\
    \ put it in the flame-proof container. If not, fold the herbs tightly into the\
    \ piece of paper. If you\x92re using paper, perhaps write onto it what you want\
    \ to send or draw symbols relevant to your message. Then burn the herbs, either\
    \ by sprinkling them onto the charcoal disk or by lighting the folded paper by\
    \ the candle\x92s flame and quickly placing it into the dish or bowl. As you watch\
    \ the smoke curl up, speak the following words:"
