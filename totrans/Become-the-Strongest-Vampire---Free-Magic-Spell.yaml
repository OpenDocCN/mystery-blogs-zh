    do more until the flame goes out. Then think of your self with ruby red eyes fangs

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can't. vampires aren't physically real. magick is a neutral energy that
    only effects energy to bring a desired changed. it doesn't contradict nature because
    it's a part of nature, ruled by nature, and since humans cannot naturally transform,
    and vampires aren't physical beings [they're astral beings like spirits or fae]
    no spell will let you physically transform because it would contradict nature.
