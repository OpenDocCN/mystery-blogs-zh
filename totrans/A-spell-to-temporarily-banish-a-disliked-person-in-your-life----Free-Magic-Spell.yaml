- en: Take your bowl/container then proceed to add the item that you own that came
    from the person you dislike. Add the water slowly. Stir this in for about 5-10
    minutes. Put the jewelry ( remember nothing overly expensive ) in the water and
    leave it there for 1 hour. After one hour the water and the particles of the item
    that you own that came from the person you dislike will have soaked into this
    jewelry item. You can then proceed to give the jewelry to the person you dislike.
    This should temporarily banish them from your thoughts and life. Temporarily=
    a day. Enjoy this while you can.
