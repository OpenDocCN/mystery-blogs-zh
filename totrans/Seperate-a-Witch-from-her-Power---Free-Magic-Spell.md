This does not work. You can block a witch from using their powers against you, our power comes from all around us. If you personally are having a spiritual block, there are ways to connect back to spirit, but a spell will not permanently take away your power. Furthermore, ''gypsy's'' are real people, not things you can tap for ingredients. While they have a culture that includes Magic, divination, and ritual, their blood is not a powerful weapon to be used in spells. Also, most prefer the term Romani as ''gypsi'' has historically been used more as an insult.
