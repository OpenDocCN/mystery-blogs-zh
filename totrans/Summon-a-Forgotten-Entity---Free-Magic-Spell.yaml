- en: Hair appears as either dark smoke or golden flames. Shadows surrounding the
    eyes that complement the iridescent orbs. Half the face covered with black cloth;
    rumored to be full of youth. Clad in black, and adorned in chains once used to
    keep them restrained in Hell. ''Nomen mihi Trinit?s Argentia.'' ''Trinit?s Argentia''
    is only one of the names this entity goes by. I will not reveal what their true
    name is, as I was not given permission to do so. The incantation doesn't reveal
    their true name, but the nicknames they often went by. By the way, the '?' is
    a long 'a;' 'a' with a line over it (pronounced ''Tree-nee-toss Our-gen-tee-ah'')

    **has** to be a good reason; a small quarrel with someone that's easily resolvable
    or mere hurt feelings are not good enough reasons.

    one). While you hold the mask, from the description given, imagine what you believe
    Trinit?s will look like. While Trinit?s may appear like that to you, they may
    not appear like that to another (only one person knows what they really look like;
    you will know if you''re the one). While keeping this image in your head and holding
    the mask, recite this:'

    the case, you will hear a voice in your head say, "Tell me why you''ve called
    me." It may sound soothing, apathetic, annoyed, or even angry depending on their
    mood or if they didn''t like what they "read" off of you. Be warned: Trinit?s
    **knows** what your intentions may be, as they can "read" anyone like a book.
    If you''re doing this as a joke, Trinit?s will know it and let you know that they''re
    very real (and it won''t be pretty for you). This is best used for revenge and
    power. As I''ve stated already, they won''t take action over mere hurt feelings
    or a tiny quarrel between someone that can be easily resolved, and if they sense
    that you will abuse the power be ready to have a lesson learned. As stated already,
    Trinit?s can "read" people like a book.'

    with it. I've noticed that they will happily accept any chain of any kind (as
    long as it's made out of metal), incense (especially lotus, jasmine, and dragon's
    blood, but any will do), hibiscus tea, and blood. If you don't have any other
    offering to go with it, they'll just draw from your energy (I wouldn't recommend
    this, as they'll draw a large amount).

    quite ruthless when it comes to getting the job done; you don't want to be a target.
    If you're lucky enough to be on their good side they are a wonderful protector.
