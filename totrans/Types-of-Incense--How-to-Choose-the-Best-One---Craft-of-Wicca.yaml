- en: 'There are three main types of incense: directly lit, heated, and unlit. Directly
    lit incense must be set on fire and burned. It is the most common and often comes
    as a stick. Heated incense is warmed up on a candle, charcoal, or heater and emits
    an aroma.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the most common type of incense. You’ve probably seen this or even used
    this type. A stick of incense is lit and placed in a holder to catch the ash from
    burning. As the stick burns down (sort of like a cigarette), scented smoke is
    emitted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a variety of perfumes and lengths available for scenting a big room
    or for religious purposes. The length of the stick determines how long it takes
    to burn. By cutting an incense stick, you may change its burning time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    thickness.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coil incense is essentially the same thing as stick incense, except that the
    stick has been wrapped into a long spiral.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because sticks cannot actually be bent like this, coil incenses are composed
    entirely of incense material. They lack a hardwood core in the center.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The lengthy burning period of this sort of incense distinguishes it. Coil incense
    is ideal for scenting a big place, such as a hotel lobby or a space with several
    corridors.

    is directly formed into a cone so that it stands on its own.

    cones increases stronger as the burning portion of the cone falls into the broader
    region of the cone. This sort of incense is ideal for quickly scenting a place.

    elements. They solely contain incense material and no core for support.

    because many types of cooking involve this from smoked meat and grilled foods
    to fermented ones as well.

    the first is called ***Monkoh***, and it is a very small piece of wood. In modern
    times, it is usually placed on an electric heater that will reach a constant perfect
    temperature.

    be burned down in a dish of sand. Then the wood pieces will be placed next to

- en: This traditional style of incense is combined, kneaded, and matured in pottery
    jars for three to five years before being used. You may have seen this being used
    in the Japanese Tea Ceremony.

- en: Kneaded incense feels a bit like playdough. This makes it very easy to adjust
    the amount being used by breaking off or adding pieces to the dough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kneaded incense has a pleasant, creamy aroma and is not lit with a flame; rather,
    it is heated using charcoal or a wood chip heater, or even in modern times, an
    electric heater. This is very similar to how wood incense is heated.

    shaped molds with a mixed incense formula. Plum blossoms, the moon, and other
    shapes are possible. When burnt with charcoal, this type of incense releases its

    practice, spellwork, building energy, focus, and more.

    be too intense for some people. This means that incense sticks and cones tend
    to be better for large rooms or at least have a window open.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Heated incense is mild and soothing, but it tends to be more expensive and requires
    you to have a way of heating the incense. This is a great choice for small apartments
    or meditation rooms. Quality electric incense heaters go for around $50 ([check
    current prices here](https://amzn.to/3GU4lgI)), but once you buy one, you are
    set for life.
