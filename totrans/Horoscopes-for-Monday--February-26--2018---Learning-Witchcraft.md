## Is Today Your Birthday?

Is the world in as bad a state as some people say it is? Of course not. In fact there is every reason to believe that the next 12 months will be remarkable in the most positive of ways. Celebrate your birthday, then celebrate each and every day to come.

### AQUARIUS

You may be eager to start something new but the planets urge you to be cautious. It may feel as if you are lagging behind your rivals but there is no need to rush things. Watch and learn from what others do, especially from their mistakes.

### PISCES

The Sun in your sign, alongside Mercury and Venus, makes all things possible, but that does not mean you should try to do everything. What is the one thing you would choose to do if you could do no other? Do it magnificently today.

### ARIES

It’s not like you to get emotional for no good reason but you will be pushed to keep your feelings under strict control this week. Above all refuse to give in to self-pity. You have so much going for you now – keep reminding yourself of that fact.

### TAURUS

A decision about your career should be left a day or two. According to the planets you don’t yet know all the facts, so be smart and hold back from committing yourself. If you move too early it could cost you financially and professionally.

### GEMINI

The Sun in the career area of your chart means you must get serious about your ambitions. You may think you are serious already but are you prepared to put everything you have on the line? Go the extra yard, then make it a mile.

### CANCER

You seem to be more relaxed now the Sun is moving through the most philosophical area of your chart. Finally you recognize that you don’t need more material success, you need more peace of mind. Do whatever it takes to get it.

### LEO

It may appear as if you are the only one in the neighborhood who does not know what is going on but it’s probably not true. There is no big secret that the world is keeping from you, so maybe you should stop taking life so seriously.

### VIRGO

Make time for other people today, especially people who need a shoulder to lean on, and maybe cry on too. If you go out of your way to put their interests first now the universe will go out of its way to protect you later on.

### LIBRA

You must stay on top of your workload this coming week, because if you fall behind even a little bit it will be an uphill struggle to catch up again. Do what must be done, do it on time and do it well. Stay ahead of the game.

### SCORPIO

If you make a promise to a friend or relative today you must be absolutely certain that you can deliver. If you let them down, even if it’s not their fault, they will hold it against you not just for days but for weeks, maybe months, to come.

### SAGITTARIUS

You want to go out into the world and have fun but something in the back of your brain is nagging at you to be careful. You don’t have to give up on the good life altogether but you do have to keep your eyes and ears open.

### CAPRICORN

People you meet over the next few days, both in your personal life and professionally, will bring new ideas to the table and from those ideas new opportunities will arise. You’re not the only one whose mind is open to visions of future greatness.
