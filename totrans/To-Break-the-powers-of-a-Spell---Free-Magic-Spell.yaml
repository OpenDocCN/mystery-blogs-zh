    DRIPPINGS FROM THE CANDLE SO THAT IT STANDS ALONE. FILL THE BOWL TO THE RIM WITH
    FRESH WATER, WITHOUT WETTING THE WICK. BREATHE DEEPLY AND MEDITATE FOR A COUPLE
    OF MINUTES. WHEN YOUR MIND IS CLEAR, LIGHT THE CANDLE. VISUALIZE THE POWER OF
    THE SPELL CAST AGAINST YOU AS LIVING WITHIN THE CANDLES FLAME. AS THE CANDLE BURNS
    DOWN, IT WILL SPLUTTER AND GO OUT AS IT TOUCHES THE WATER. AS IT IS EXTINGUISHED
    BY THE WATER, THE SPELL IS BROKEN .FINALLY, DIG A HOLE IN TO THE GROUND, POUR
    THE WATER INTO IT, THEN BURY THE CANDLE.

    use salt instead of water. I would also observe the way the candle burns as well
    as the flame as this could determine how the spell is going.
