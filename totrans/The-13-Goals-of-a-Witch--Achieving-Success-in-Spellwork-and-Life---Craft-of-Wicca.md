You’re drawn to the witch lifestyle for a reason. You want to achieve success in spellwork and in life. But what are the specific goals of a witch?

 There is no one answer to this question, as the goals of a witch can vary from person to person. However, there are some general themes that appear in nearly all lists of witch goals.

 In this post, we’ll explore the 13 goals of a witch and discuss how you can achieve them in your own life.

 ## What Are the Goals of a Witch?

So, you want to know the goals of a witch? It’s a broad question, and there is no one answer that fits everyone. However, after years of studying and practicing witchcraft, Scott Cunningham famously distilled the 13 most essential goals that all witches should strive for:

 1.  Know yourself
2.  Know your craft
3.  Learn
4.  Apply knowledge with wisdom
5.  Achieve balance
6.  Keep your words in good order
7.  Keep your thoughts in good order
8.  Celebrate life
9.  Attune with the cycles of the Earth
10.  Breathe and eat correctly
11.  Exercise the body
12.  Meditate
13.  Honor the Divine

These goals help direct you onto the right path for developing a solid spiritual practice and creating positive change in the world.

 A witch is never done working on herself or her magic, and there is always room for growth. But if you can focus on these 13 goals and make them your own, you will be well on your way to success in spellwork and life.

 ## The 13 Goals of a Witch Deep Dive

The ability to perform magic is both alluring and powerful.

It is of the utmost importance that you know yourself before you begin a serious practice. Many people cannot hold themselves accountable.

 There are many people who have ruined their lives by giving in to every whim: curse this enemy, manipulate that crush, and on and on.

It is okay to be fast to anger, but you must know that about yourself and understand how to keep yourself from using magic when in these situations.

Goals 2-4 go together. This is a lifelong journey of mastering a craft. It is much better to understand what goes into a spell and why you are doing it than to blindly copy someone else’s work.

 This means we must keep learning and understanding our craft. This way, when our magic doesn’t work for whatever reason, we have the ability to analyze what went wrong and take corrective action.

 If you have no understanding of your craft, you’ll be stuck.

Balance is important in all things. The elements are in balance, and our lives must also be in balance for much the same reason as the first goal.

 When we are out of balance with nature or our spiritual selves, then things will go wrong.

Wicca is a religion of nature. This is why I recommend having your own [Wiccan garden](https://craftofwicca.com/the-essential-wiccan-garden-design-supplies-and-more/).

 This means we must become intimate with the ways of nature: celebrating the [Wheel of the Year](https://craftofwicca.com/wiccan-holidays-wheel-of-the-year-explained/), nurturing life in all its forms, and communing with the Earth.

 I know a lot of witches want to ignore this part, but it is very important. You cannot properly sense the energy around you and manipulate it during magic and spellwork if you are not attuned to nature.

One of the best ways to improve this part of your practice is to start a [Wiccan meditation](https://craftofwicca.com/how-to-start-a-daily-wiccan-meditation/).

 There is no easy and quick way to become a competent witch, and an incompetent witch is very dangerous to herself and others.

 Lastly, do not ignore the divine aspect of Wicca. There is so much out there that is unseen and bigger than us all, and this is all that needs to be meant by “the Divine.”

Wicca is a religion without dogma, so you do not need to worship in any formal way, but I assure you my witchcraft improved as soon as I honored that such power existed beyond my reach.

It humbles you and helps you keep your practice in perspective.

 At the core of every witch’s practice are the 13 Goals of a Witch, which represent the essential skills and traits that every witch must develop in order to be successful.

 These goals encompass everything from developing a strong magical will to mastering the art of spellwork, to become emotionally balanced and fulfilled.

 Achieving these goals is the key to success in your personal and magical lives.

 Do you have what it takes? Only time will tell!

## Achieving These Goals Through Spellwork

Now that you know the 13 goals of a witch, you may be wondering how you can achieve them through spellwork. Here are a few tips:

*   Choose spells that correspond with your goals.
*   Visualize yourself achieving your goals as you perform the spell.
*   Believe in yourself and your ability to achieve success.
*   Be patient and stay focused on your goal.
*   Use your willpower to achieve your goals.

If you keep the goals in mind each time you perform spellwork, you will start to subconsciously incorporate them into every aspect of your life.

 This is the best way to really embody the true nature of Wicca and being a witch. When you struggle to follow the path, then you will constantly stumble.

 I no longer even think about these goals. They are just a part of my identity after years of keeping them in mind as I performed my craft.

## Achieving These Goals Through Other Means

While the thirteen goals of a witch can be achieved through spellwork, it’s important to remember that there are other ways to accomplish these goals as well.

 For example, if you want to be successful in your career, you can work hard and hone your skills. Or, if you want to find love, you can put yourself out there and meet new people.

 The most important thing is to stay focused and driven. Remember why you’re working towards these goals in the first place, and don’t let anything stand in your way. With dedication and perseverance, you can achieve anything!

 I highly recommend having a Wiccan journal in addition to your Book of Shadows. In this journal, you can reflect on what each of the goals means to you and you can record if you are following the goals and how you slip up.

 You can track which are hardest for you and make a conscious effort to improve in those areas.

 Journaling is a highly underrated part of being a witch.

## Conclusion

So there you have it: the 13 goals of a witch. These goals can help you achieve success in spellwork and life. Just remember to stay positive, patient, and persistent, and always put your needs first. Congratulations on making it to the end!

If you want to achieve success in spellwork and life, you’ll need to focus on achieving these goals.
