Ever heard of tea leaf reading? It’s a fascinating form of divination, kind of like [peering into a crystal ball](https://teaandrosemary.com/how-to-use-a-crystal-ball-divination/) but with tea! This ancient practice, also known as tasseography, involves interpreting the patterns left by tea leaves in a cup. It’s not just for psychics or fortune tellers; anyone can give it a try. In fact, learning how to read tea leaves is one of the *easiest* ways to get started with divination.

## What You’ll Need

**A Cup:** Traditionally, a white, wide-brimmed cup is used.

**Loose Leaf Tea:** Any kind works, but larger leaves can create clearer patterns. If you only have tea bags, you can simply cut open a bag, but again, choose the bag with the largest tea leaves you have.

**Hot Water:** To brew the tea, of course!

## The Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Tea

Brew your tea in the cup. Don’t use a strainer! You want those leaves free-floating.

### Step 2: Sip and Contemplate

As you drink, think about a question or area of your life you’re curious about. This is when you “ask the question” by focusing on your intent. 

### Step 3: Leave a Little Liquid

Stop drinking when there’s about a teaspoon of liquid left. This bit is crucial – you need a tiny bit of liquid so the tea leaves can move around, but you don’t want too much, or they won’t stick to the cup.

### Step 4: Swirl and Flip

Now, swirl the cup three times clockwise. Then, flip it upside down onto a saucer or plate. Give it a minute. The remaining tea will drain away, and the leaves will cling to the cup’s sides.

### Step 5: Reading Time

Turn the cup upright. This is where the magic happens! The leaves will have formed patterns. Use your intuition to interpret these shapes. Here are some basic guidelines:

*   **Symbols at the Rim:** These are about immediate or very recent happenings.
*   **Mid-Cup Symbols:** These pertain to events occurring in the not-too-distant future.
*   **Symbols Near the Bottom:** These predict the far future.

Common symbols include:

*   **Heart for love or relationships**
*   **Lines for journeys or paths**
*   **Circles for completion or success**

Don’t worry if the shapes don’t look clear at first. It’s all about what you see and feel.

Take whatever you *think* you see first and look into the symbolism of the shape. For example, if you think you see a horse but have absolutely no connection to horses, look up the symbolism of the horse in different cultures until you find an answer that rings true.

There aren’t any rigid rules here. Instead, you need to pay close attention to your intuition. Remember that this reading is specific to *you*, so the answer could be something you alone understand based on your memories and experiences.
