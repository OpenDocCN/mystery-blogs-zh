    a bath the night before the full moon. While taking the bath, chant '' Mermaids
    of the sea, how I wish to join thee. With a tail color of _____ when I transform,
    and hair long like kelp. This is my will so mote it be.'' That night put the picture
    under your pillow and ask the mermaid goddess Atargatis for your tail. Next day
    do the same things and also the day after that!

    that. [just be prepared to defend your opinion when nay-sayers come calling. And
    trust me, they will]

    transformation is not possible with Real Magik. Mermaids are not physical beings,
    they are spiritual.
