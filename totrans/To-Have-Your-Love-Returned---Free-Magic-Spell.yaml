- en: This spell is candle magic and also representational. It is a little more complicated
    than most because it requires an understanding of symbolism. It is best done on
    a Friday. The objects you use need not be the real things, but they can be miniaturizations
    such as cake decorations.

    If after this time the flowers are still fresh, this is a good sign. You should
    then bury them or put them (along with the horseshoe and key) in a pot pourri.

    worthwhile. If you cannot find an article of the other persons clothing, a handkerchief
    or some other small article will do as well. If that is not possible then use
    a square of pink material.
