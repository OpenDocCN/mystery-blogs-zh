Basically turn into a dog/wolf for a day.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Dog or Wolf Transformation'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Believe this spell will work, if you don't might as well leave now. Get onto the ground on your hands and knees. Focus your mind on the dog/wolf you want to be. Chant:

"Woof, woof, bark, bark, heavenly dog spirits, allow me to see from a dogs view for a day."

If you feel normal, repeat the spell. But if any of the four happen to you, remember to stay on the ground and don't really move from where the spell was cast, otherwise the transformation may fail.

Could you make one to stay as a dog/wolf forever?? Im done with being a human :( (if you dont believe in shifting spells you dont have to replay to this comment)

The ''Woof woof bark bark'' part honestly made me laugh lol. Anyway, this is a fake spell, but if someone's genuinely interested in this sort of thing they could look into astral shifting.

You cannot physically transform.
