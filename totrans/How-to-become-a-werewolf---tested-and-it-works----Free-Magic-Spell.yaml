    to yourself as human with any chosen clothes on. Your old clothes will be transported
    to the wash. Your first transformation will hurt but after the first time it won't
    hurt much. Like banging your funny bone (why do they call it that when it's not
    even funny!) And that's one your first transformation. Any others won't hurt.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simple, to sound real. People want to sound powerful, cool, legitimate [take
    your pick] so they lie because it's anonymous [yes, we know the username but not
    the person behind the screen] So little things like taking a necklace, saying
    some words won't harm anyone physically, but scammers in the pagan spaces are
    very common. ''Give me 20$ and I'll cast a spell to make all of your dreams come
    true.'' Total scam, but desperate people will believe it. I've heard horror stories
    of people losing thousands because someone started out with a 20$ love spell that
    became ''your family is being cursed by a coven of Satanic witches. I can save
    you if you send me 1000$ for supplies plus 500$ for me to cast it'' and some will
    actually pay. I don't want to scare anyone or to mistrust, every online caster,
    just think before you act. Magick is real, but on the physical it has limitations.
    The majority of the time, bad luck is just normal misfortunes and not someone
    with a grudge cursing you [honestly, witches curse other witches, especially online,
    is incredibly rare, and even rarer it works because of natural protections, your
    own protection spells, and even the skill of the other witch. Those who boast
    rarely act on their words]

- en: jesus christ wtf. This is heavily misinformational. Any spell that requires
    you to have some sort of object (specifically a bracelet or other piece of jewelry)
    is completely false. This will not work at all, and is way too twilight-esque.
    Good inspo for crappy wattpad stories though. Please give out real information
    instead of giving many children the false hope for false results.
