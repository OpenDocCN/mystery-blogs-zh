    justice. Justice is demonstrating to you that all actions have repercussions in
    a broad sense. So, when you consider your current situation from that perspective,
    what role did your own activities play in putting you in this situation?

    The choices you make will have consequences. You will eventually be judged, it
    is inevitable. When the Justice tarot card appears in a reading, a fair and appropriate
    decision will be made.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    at work, getting laid off, a relationship conflict, etc). The appearance of the
    upright Justice card means that you can trust whatever is to come as being fair
    and true.

    line with the highest good for everybody, you may make a deliberate decision.
    You will be held accountable for the decisions you make, so be prepared to stand

    or your own moral compass is out of balance. You may need to take matters into
    your own hands.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Justice Reversed may imply that you are aware inwardly that what you did was
    wrong ethically. You have two options: you may conceal it and hope no one finds
    out, or you can face up to your faults and take decisive action to fix the problem.
    Others may not have noticed it yet.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being caught in a ruse or cheating can be strongly suggested by the Justice
    card being reversed. Therefore, if you have been lying or cheating on your relationship,
    be prepared for severe consequences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take responsibility for your actions rather than attempting to evade the consequences.
    Because of that, you’ll gain greater respect. Compared to the upright card, the
    Justice reversed can be a more potent sign of a lack of work-life balance.

    are trustworthy before doing so.

    for your predicament if you’ve been having financial difficulties. Although it
    may sound harsh, accepting responsibility for a challenging circumstance may really
    be liberating.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their
    symbolism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, and so it’s
    good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to
    have a good interpretation for the moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember,
    each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards
    is an art, not a science.

    fantastic artwork.

- en: This Justice has a blindfold on, which is a great addition. True Justice should
    be blind to all external biases such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, and
    so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only is she blindfolded, but it seems her eyes have been damaged. This Justice
    is completely committed to her job. She cannot even cheat and remove her blindfold
    to find out who she is judging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s interesting to note that the scale and sword have reversed hands. I like
    this modern take better. Her right hand, the symbolically dominant one, is the
    one doing the evaluation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First comes evaluation, then comes consequences. The left-hand sword is down,
    which indicates that she is not ready to punish anyone who crosses her. She must
    first make the judgment before raising the sword, if that is even necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
