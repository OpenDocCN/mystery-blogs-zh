- en: Sunday is the day to cast a health spell. You want to wait until the moon is
    almost full before you begin. Decorate your altar in yellow or green before you
    begin.

- en: Gather together the following materials. You need an item cast out of gold,
    a white candle for the altar, a green taper candle, either roses or daffodils,
    and a crystal (clear crystal quartz).

- en: Light the white candle and give it your full attention. Think about the person
    you want to bless with good health. Visualize them whole again. If you want to
    cast the spell for yourself, that is fine.

- en: As you think about the person that needs to be healed, set the green candle
    ablaze. As the flame gets stronger, visualize the person getting stronger and
    stronger. Then, say the following words.
