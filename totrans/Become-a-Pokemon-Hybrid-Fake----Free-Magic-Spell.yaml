  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a fake spell, the creator has made all this up, so no pokemon parts
    will appear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ya. I know. But what does pokemon parts mean? Does it mean the pokemon will
    be parts and pieces and you put it together?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this were real it would mean you would become the pokemon.
  prefs: []

- en: No, the parts would grow on you, if this worked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This does not work. It even says it is fake, WolfShifter4, please wake up to
    reality. You cannot become a Pokemon, why are you so insistent even when the author
    even told you it is fake, therefore it does not work, and was simply for fun?
    The only thing this could do is build up energy, give it no direction, and it
    turns on you, backfires, and cause problems in your life.
