- en: The Hanged Man card has long been one that most fascinated me. It has a lot
    of references in popular culture, and the traditional Rider-Waite image is so
    unexpected.

- en: Rather than a man hanging by his neck, he’s hanging by his ankle. Moreover,
    his posture is that of a bent knee and arms behind his back. It’s almost a relaxed
    or whimsical posture.

- en: The tree forms a tau cross (in other words a T). This is a significant choice
    when contrasted with an outstretched branch. The man himself is in the given position
    to give the illusion of a fylfot cross (in other words a swastika).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look carefully you’ll see this. Remember, the fylfot cross had a different
    meaning before the Nazi use. The symbol can be found on ancient bells because
    it represented thunder. The bells were used to dispel thunderstorms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    card has the man upside-down. If you’re starting out, it’s easy to look at the
    reversed Hanged Man and see an upright figure and get confused.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and thinking and introspection. The enlightenment brings about a transformation.

    the struggle to get free and is enjoying and making the most of being stuck there.

    you’re stuck and yet you’re still trying to get out of the situation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of letting go and turning inward during this period of your life, you
    want to move on too quickly. You’re grasping at external fixes, and they all seem
    to be wasting your time.

    sacrifice that is necessary. This will depend on the card’s position and the question
    asked.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their
    symbolism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, and so it’s
    good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to
    have a good interpretation for the moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember
    that each reading, deck, person, position, and question differs. Reading the cards
    is an art, not a science.

    Spirits Tarot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s notice several of the differences. The first major difference is the inclusion
    of a skeleton. This emphasizes the idea that you’re stuck based on death.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could mean that fear of death is keeping you in place, but it could also
    mean that dwelling on something beyond the grave is the problem. Maybe you’re
    not moving on from a deceased loved one or relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    could go on forever. Stop looking for a way to end it and embrace the stasis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If someone died, they are gone forever. There is no such thing as getting out
    of that situation. The best thing to do is to embrace it. Struggling against permanence
    is a cause of so much of our suffering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next major change that jumps out is that the halo has moved from his head
    to his hand. This shifts the emphasis from current enlightenment to future enlightenment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have physical power now due to this situation. This power is going in or
    out of his arm with those lightning streaks. Don’t forget that being stuck in
    place gives you a lot of power you wouldn’t have if you were moving.

    choosing to stay put and get the most out of it.
  prefs: []
