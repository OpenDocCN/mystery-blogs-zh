    Garden. A large apple tree looms behind the woman, with a snake making its way
    up its trunk. The serpent and apple tree signify the allure of sensuous pleasures
    that might divert one’s attention away from the Divine.

    despite societal conventions. We regard this as a progression from the Hierophant,
    who issued decrees and passed on his knowledge via a regulated method.

- en: The Lovers tarot card represents a magnificent unity and balance of energy,
    showing complementary energies. This card depicts a duo that complements each
    other nicely. However, because this card also represents an option and the decision
    of commitment, it raises the question of how dedicated you are to love.

    fragile and have learned to open their hearts and express their most intimate
    sentiments. They form the vessel out of which faith and loyalty can arise, resulting
    in a strong relationship between the two.

    with a coworker that is amicable and favorable to both. Contrary to common opinion,
    the Lovers card may also represent platonic connections, yet it can also indicate
    a blossoming passionate relationship.

    two elements that appear to be in contradiction and construct something that is
    ‘whole,’ united, and harmonious.

    is frigid. What was once in equilibrium is no longer functional. Some issue is
    most certainly impeding your connection, which must be overcome before you can
    build a stronger link.
  prefs: []

    are in control of your own fate. Don’t blame the cosmos if your condition is the
    product of your own actions.

    will be able to go on if you accomplish this. You will have a better grasp of
    your actual self, values, and beliefs, and you will minimize the harm in the future.

- en: The Lovers Reversed can also represent a lack of reciprocal affections in a
    partnership. One member is more intensely attached than the other, and so this
    difference may lead to dissatisfaction and insecurity later on. For fear of being
    harmed, you may be hesitant to expose your heart to the connection.

    financial stability at risk. Are you making wise decisions, or are you striving

    good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to
    have a good interpretation for the moment.
