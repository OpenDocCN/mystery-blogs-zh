- en: Light two black candles on the altar you have worked up the negative energy
    and your anger has built.Take the voodoo doll and visualize with intensity that
    it is your enemy before you. You may even cut out the face on a picture of your
    victim and glue it to the head of the voodoo doll. If you have any nail clippings
    or hair follicles or any small item that has the victims vibration on it, you
    can place it inside the voodoo doll. That will make it a much stronger connection
    and all the more powerful.

- en: Once you have worked up the negative energy and your anger has drawn near its
    boiling point, slam it to the altar and stab one time at the doll in the place
    where you wish to afflict pain. Then take another pin if you so desire and prick
    the doll once again in a place where you wish to afflict more pain. Each time
    you stab at the voodoo doll make sure you are visualizing that you are actually
    inflicting pain on your enemy.

    the following incantation. "Smitten, battered, beaten, and torn: I prick at thee
    as if a thorn. Suffer now I will not wait. With this pin I seal your fate. Pins
    so sharp and made of steel: I strike at thee, these pins you''ll feel. Smitten,
    battered, beaten, and torn: I curse you now, your pain is born!"'

- en: You may repeat this again for a few days if you wish, adding more pins and leaving
    the pins that are already there alone. Do not touch the pins after you have placed
    them. Once again, if you touch any of the pins after they have been placed, the
    curse will come back on you.
