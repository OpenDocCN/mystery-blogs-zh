In synastry, Sun-Moon aspects are extremely important. In fact, the beneficial aspects are known as “soulmate” placements.

Although you don’t *need* any of these aspects to find your lifelong love, you will feel a strong energetic pull if you do happen to see one of these aspects in your synastry chart.

When you’re looking at Sun-Moon aspects, the Sun person typically represents the ego or identity while the Moon person is the emotional undercurrent of the relationship. The Sun individual will be more outgoing and action-oriented; the Moon person will be more soft and sensitive.

## Sun Conjunct Moon Synastry

The Sun conjunct Moon synastry aspect is is one of the traditional soulmate placements. It creates a very good foundation for any relationship. Both people are able to understand and relate to each other.

Typically, the Sun person is more *active* with this Sun conjunct Moon synastry aspect. The Moon person plays a supportive role to the Sun person’s activities and goals, yet this doesn’t hamper or hold back the Moon individual.

Often, this couple is on the same page to the extent that they don’t need to communicate their feelings. This is the couple who can sense what each other is feeling and thinking from across the room.

The Sun conjunct Moon synastry aspect means that the *emotional expression* of both people match in some way.

The Sun person feels that the emotions of the Moon individual are appropriate and “right,” while the Moon person enjoys that the Sun individual says what they’re thinking without holding back. The Moon individual also provides emotional stability and comfort in the relationship.

Usually, this couple will truly appreciate the emotional responses of each other because they are exactly what they each need.

In nature, the Moon reflects the light of the Sun. This conjunction is similar because the Moon individual plays a supportive role, while the Sun individual is more active.

The Sun person will support the Moon person in a more energetic, upbeat way, while the Moon individual will be softer towards the Sun person.

Both people fill in the gaps for what the other is missing. In the astrological chart, the Sun and Moon are the two primary signs, so together this couple creates a well-rounded picture.

Sometimes, the Moon person can be *too* submissive and the Sun person *too* dominant and active. If you have this Sun conjunct Moon synastry aspect, be careful that you keep maintain the balance so that neither person feels off-kilter.

This Sun conjunct Moon synastry aspect seems to be more natural when the woman is the Moon and the man is the Sun in the aspect. However, this can also create gender roles that feel too extreme, depending on the personalities.

If the genders are swapped (the man is the Moon and the woman is the Sun) then the relationship may be more balanced. In some cases, this aspect can cause problems if the man feels that he is being cast in a role that is too feminine.

Ultimately, the Sun individual will “lead” the relationship, but the Moon person is needed to create the softer, emotional underbelly of the partnership. Neither can function as well without the other.

## Sun Trine Moon Synastry

With the Sun trine Moon synastry aspect, the relationship simply flows. The Moon person relies on the Sun person’s energy, enthusiasm, and vibrancy, while the Sun person appreciates the emotional support of the Moon person.

This couple has a strong emotional bond. They’re attracted to each other mentally and naturally understand each other. 

In fact, the Sun trine Moon synastry aspect means that this couple is *really* in sync. They may each feel actual pain when the other person is hurt.

Each person feels as though they can rely on the other. This is a natural quality, so this is often found in the chart of couples who stay together long term. The Sun trine Moon synastry aspect makes this energy flow from day one!

Typically, the Sun trine Moon synastry couple is at ease with each other. The Sun person may “lead” the relationship a bit more, while the Moon individual provides the emotional support, but this usually works for the couple and no one feels overshadowed.

This relationship is full of emotional bonding. Each person feels super secure with the other; you know that your emotions are safe with each other.

The Sun person shines a light on the Moon person’s darker side, while the Moon individual gives emotional depth to the Sun’s ego.

Ultimately, this is a really beneficial, important aspect. Look to the signs that this Sun trine Moon synastry aspect is in to see how the energy will specifically manifest.

## Sun Sextile Moon Synastry

With the Sun sextile Moon synastry aspect, the relationship is cooperative and warm. The Moon person easily trusts the Sun and allows them to see their emotions, while the Sun person gains emotional support from the Moon person.

This relationship simply flows. There is a good deal of emotional understanding between this couple. 

However, this Sun sextile Moon synastry aspect isn’t *totally* natural. These qualities are things the couple can work *towards*. The energy of this aspect exists right away, but it takes work to cultivate these qualities permanently.

Over time, a couple with the Sun sextile Moon synastry aspect can learn how to be more emotionally supportive and gentle with each other. They begin to understand each other’s emotions without verbal communication because there is an energetic flow.

The Sun sextile Moon aspect is great for a cooperative relationship. The couple may need to develop better communication skills over time, though.

All the Sun sextile Moon aspect means is that good communication and emotional understanding is *possible.* If both people are willing to work on the relationship, it can go the distance!

## Sun Opposition Moon Synastry

The Sun opposition Moon synastry aspect creates a really unique bond. The couple is attracted to each other and there is a lot of strong energy, but the relationship can have a variety of emotional and mental issues, too.

Although this aspect binds the couple together in some way, it can be an emotional mismatch. The Moon person might feel like the Sun person is insensitive or doesn’t care about their feelings, while the Sun person might not realize this or may think that the Moon person is too sensitive.

The Sun person might feel like they’re held back from pursuing their goals because the Moon needs too much support from them.

The Moon person might have emotional issues from childhood that get in the way of pursuing this relationship. On the other hand, the Sun person may be too quick to act or have too large of an ego to truly see what the Moon person needs from them.

Keep in mind that the Sun opposition Moon synastry isn’t *bad.* Often, oppositions in synastry can be complementary. They provide a charged energy that makes the couple *want* to stay with each other.

This couple will be truly fascinated with each other with the Sun opposition Moon synastry aspect. However, the relationship may feel like it’s a constant struggle between the identity of the Sun person and the emotions of the Moon person.

There’s a lot of potential for hurt feelings to surface in this relationship.

Ultimately, the Sun opposition Moon synastry aspect *can* work in a partnership if both people are willing to invest in learning how to communicate about their emotions in a mature and positive way.

## Sun Square Moon Synastry

The Sun square Moon synastry aspect can be difficult in a relationship. The Sun person may seem controlling, domineering, egotistical, or self-centered, while the Moon person may appear too delicate or emotional.

Much of this comes from conditioning. The Sun person has learned that to attack or control the other is the only way to have a relationship, while the Moon person has learned that they need to be dependent on their partner in order to make it work.

The Sun square Moon synastry aspect means that both people *are* attracted to each other, but the relationship always feels pretty tense. They may even be competitive with *each other.*

Sometimes, the Sun person feels like they have to give up or compromise on their goals in order to please the Moon person.

The Moon individual is slower to act and needs more daily security, while the Sun person probably wants something bigger out of life. 

With this Sun square Moon synastry aspect, the Sun person probably doesn’t get the support that they need to achieve their dreams. They then try to control or dominate the Moon person to feel as though they have *something*.

Ultimately, this dynamic can create a lot of conflict. The Moon person can’t *understand* the drive and identity of the Sun, while the Sun person can’t *feel* the emotions of the Moon.

Sometimes, one or both people refuse to support each other, while other times both individuals simply don’t understand how the other functions. They’re very different people!

The first step to healing this Sun square Moon synastry aspect is for both people to develop a *deep* desire to understand each other. They function very differently, so it will take a lot of communication practice.

As they work through these issues, the Sun person should be delicate with the Moon person’s feelings, while the Moon person should be careful of hurting the Sun individual’s ego.

The Sun square Moon synastry aspect means that both people will need to work through their emotional issues and delve into how they were raised and why they have their specific values.
