Place the pentagram next to the black candle and sprinkle salt all the way around the circle to seal it. Sit outside the circle and draw an X over your target's picture. Call out to Satan for help and chant what you wish to happen o your target until you fell the energy all around you. Drip black wax onto the picture and seal it in an envelope. Blow out the candeles and your done!

Tested and it actually works.
