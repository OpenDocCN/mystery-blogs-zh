- en: As someone who has been practicing crystal healing for many years, I am always
    excited to explore new ways to incorporate crystals into my spiritual practice.
    With Samhain just around the corner, I have been doing some research on which
    crystals are best suited for this time of year. Samhain, also known as the Celtic
    New Year, is a time when the veil between the worlds is thin, making it an ideal
    time for divination, ancestor work, and spiritual growth.

- en: One of my favorite crystals to work with during Samhain is obsidian. This dark,
    volcanic glass is known for its ability to absorb negative energy and protect
    against psychic attacks. It also helps to facilitate communication with the spirit
    world, making it an excellent crystal for those who wish to connect with their
    ancestors or receive messages from the other side. In addition to obsidian, other
    crystals that are well-suited for Samhain include black tourmaline, smoky quartz,
    and hematite. Each of these stones has its own unique properties and can be used
    to enhance your spiritual practice during this powerful time of year.
