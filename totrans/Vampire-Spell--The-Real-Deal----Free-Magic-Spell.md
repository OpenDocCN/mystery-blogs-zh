So hard to memorize

Don't worry, this doesn't work, so don't waste your time trying to memorize it.

You cannot become a vampire.

I agree you cannot so why is there a whole section of vampire spells if you can't become one? I don't think the people who made this section researched enough

Sounds like an awful rap song
