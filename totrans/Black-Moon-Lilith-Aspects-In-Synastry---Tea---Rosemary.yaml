    Venus is inherently romantic.

    simply captivated.

    Jupiter expands anything that it touches, so there is a distinct sexual energy

    to be a lot of self-discovery in this relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    religious view of life. Through learning about the Lilith individual’s beliefs
    (let’s say they center around science, for the purpose of this example), the Jupiter
    person is pushed to question their own assumptions, confront their opinions of
    the taboos that the Lilith person presents, and develop their personal view on
    these topics.

    Lilith conjunct ascendant synastry aspect have difficulty introducing their partner
    to their family and friends. There may be something taboo about their choice or
    even about the relationship’s energy. Again, this dissipates over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Lilith conjunct ascendant relationship often *feels* forbidden, even if
    it’s not. One or both of the partners typically feel guilty about entering into
    a relationship; they may still be attached to an ex partner or even a past life
    experience that they can’t completely let go of.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, the ascendant person is both intimidated by *and* attracted to the
    Lilith partner. They might see the Lilith person as a bit dark or scary, but they’re
    also intrigued by the energy. It probably is different from anything the ascendant
    person has seen before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The relationship is extremely primal at first. This is probably different and
    maybe frightening for the ascendant individual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the ascendant person has a lot of the same subconscious impulses as
    the Lilith person, they have just not accessed them yet. This new relationship
    is frightening because the Lilith person pulls out a new side of the ascendant
    person in a very public way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This Lilith conjunct ascendant aspect is tricky to navigate, especially in the
    beginning stages of relationship, but it doesn’t dictate whether or not a relationship
    will be successful in the long term. Shadow sides have a lot of impact on this
    relationship, but this can also be a great opportunity for both partners to heal
    themselves from the inside.

    is especially attracted to the dark side in the Lilith partner. They represent
    much of what the descendant person wants in a partner, but these qualities show
    up in a taboo, mysterious way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    descendant partner. Lilith conjunct descendent in synastry really brings out those
    taboo qualities within the Lilith partner. The descendent person might either
    like these qualities, be afraid of them, or both.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, the Lilith conjunct descendant synastry aspect can also mean that
    the descendent partner has *blocked* their own sexuality, so they look for a partner
    who is more sexual to compensate. This is not *always* the case with the Lilith
    conjunct descendant aspect; it shows up about half of the time.

    it comes to image. Typically, the Lilith person looks up to the Midheaven person,
    but not always.

    money or status.

    have a deep obsession with having a certain image. The specifics of this will
    depend on the sign that the Lilith conjunct Midheaven sits in.

    of themselves that they felt they had to hide in childhood.

    the whole relationship all-together. They are the one who is more inclined to
    lying and betrayal, while the Lilith individual is more likely to become obsessive
    and hang on no matter what.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    towards the Node, but this can be very hard to do, especially when someone like
    Lilith is involved. It’s easy for the North Node person to get scared and retreat.
  prefs: []

    each other’s dark sides.

    to love each other and to release the negative aspect of Lilith themes.
  prefs: []

    relationship within the Lilith individual, however these qualities all have a
    slightly darker hue than the Juno person really wants.

    person can quickly become overwhelming for the Juno individual. Long term, this
    can grow into a larger problem.
  prefs: []

    a bit delusional or have an addictive nature.

    other, if the rest of the chart supports this. They might have known that they
    were meant for each other at a young age or as soon as they met. Alternatively,
    they’re both devoted to something else (such as religion, science, a hobby, an
    activity, a cause, etc.) and work together in their passion for it.

    people have them.
  prefs: []
