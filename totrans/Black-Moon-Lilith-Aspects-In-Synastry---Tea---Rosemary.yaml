    and each other in different, more effective ways. They might realize that the
    way they “mothered” themselves isn’t working and that their partner can show them
    a better way.

    of the partners will become overly needy, reliant, codependent, or controlling.

    of pure, fated love between the couple, but there’s also something taboo about
    the relationship.

- en: With Lilith conjunct Vesta, both partners are probably very devoted to each
    other, if the rest of the chart supports this. They might have known that they
    were meant for each other at a young age or as soon as they met. Alternatively,
    they’re both devoted to something else (such as religion, science, a hobby, an
    activity, a cause, etc.) and work together in their passion for it.

- en: Although the energy between the Lilith conjunct Vesta synastry couple is pure,
    there is also a sense that they *shouldn’t* be together. Maybe their relationship
    is banned by society or by the church, or maybe they bonded over something taboo.

    what they feel (pure, sacred love) with what society says about their relationship
    (that it is taboo or forbidden).

    between each person. The sexual act can feel very ritualistic, important, or even
    spiritual with the Lilith conjunct Vesta synastry couple.

- en: Alternatively, there is a dark side to this aspect. Lilith conjunct Vesta can *also*
    mean that one partner, usually the Lilith person, is obsessed with the idea of
    purity and virginity. This may be what attracts them to the Vesta person.

    This is not always the case; most couples fit into only one of these Lilith conjunct
    Vesta synastry archetypes.

    a relationship going without other aspects, it does create a strong initial attraction.

    in the other. It’s like looking into a mirror.

- en: This can mean that each partner sees the positive sides to Lilith in the other,
    especially those that aren’t accepted in society. This can be really helpful because
    the relationship might become a safe place to express these qualities, since both
    people have them.

    the other person. These will be the qualities that they each want to run from,
    but they’re confronted with these “taboo” pieces of Lilith face to face in the
    relationship.

    properly. It allows both partners to grow and to face their own demons.

- en: If both people aren’t able to make use of this and do self work within the context
    of the relationship then it can escalate to become a pretty nasty, difficult partnership.
    Each will start hating those Lilith qualities in the other and might eventually
    only see those qualities, especially if there aren’t other strong aspects to hold
    the relationship together.
