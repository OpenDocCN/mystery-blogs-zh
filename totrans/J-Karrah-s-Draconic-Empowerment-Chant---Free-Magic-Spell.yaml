    but if you expect to become a Dragon or gain powers of a Dragon with this, no.

- en: The chant is not specific, so I doubt it does anything. You can call on dragons
    to bless objects. You can call on dragons to aid in spells. You need to specify
    what you need and why. Otherwise, you would be ignored.
