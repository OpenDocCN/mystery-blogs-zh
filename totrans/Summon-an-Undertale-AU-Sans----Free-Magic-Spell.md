# Summon an Undertale AU Sans!

  Rated 5/5 Stars

Here you can summon the Undertale AU Sans of your dreams!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Summon an Undertale AU Sans!'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Three bones (can be UNCOOKED chicken bones)

*   5 coloured candle that are the colour of the Sans's eye that you want to summon

*   Something that represents the Sans you are summoning

*   Salt

*   Love of Undertale (of course!)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Three bones (can be UNCOOKED chicken bones)

*   5 coloured candle that are the colour of the Sans's eye that you want to summon

*   Something that represents the Sans you are summoning

*   Salt

*   Love of Undertale (of course!)

First, take your salt, spread it into a circle on a hard surface. Next, place the coloured candle (Light Blue for Blueberry, Red for Fell, Dark Red for Horror, Yellow for G!Sans, you get the idea) around your salt circle.
Place the item that represents the Sans in the middle. (If you want to summon a bad Sans, use a tattered red bandana for Swapfell, or a knife for Dust, a collar for Fell, use a cleaver knife for Horror, a rotten apple for Nightmare (Doesn't have to be real), ink for Killer, and a black and white scarf for Cross)
Put the bones around the item, and light the candle.
Then say:
''Spirits, spirits, hear my call. I wish to summon (Name of Sans) from the AU (Insert AU). He will be my best friend (boyfriend if you want)
and protect me with all of his life. He shall stay with me till the end of my days.
This is my will so MOTE IT BE!''
Make sure you yell 'Mote it be' really loud. But not so loud your neighbours can hear you.

Now, good luck!

I tested it with Fell... the collar I used is gone... I always feel watched... I'm gonna use mustard to see if it worked.

I hope it does work for you, btw he can get a Little emotional when yelled at so be careful with him, Chapise?

Secretly use a camera to see if it it's Fell Sans! Good Luck!

I mean Video! Secretly use a Camera to Video it!! DX

What would I use for Error? I mean, what could possibly represent something like him?

What color of the candle should I summon for Killer?

Black. Killer's eyes are completely dark.

What colored candles should I use for Ink San's eye?

I tested it with Ink, and nothing happened.

What color did you use I am trying to summon him as well.

What...? This does not make sense what so ever. And it is not possible to summon a video game character by the way. That just does not make sense, video game character....think...how does that possibly work? That just is not logic. Sorry if I sound rude, I am just not in a good mood today, I try my best not to be mean. Again, sorry.

I hope you get in a better mood tomorrow and I hope one of these amazing sanses comes and helps you out!

What item should I use for dream sans?

I guess use yellow because of dreams eye.

Hmm... Maybe an apple since nightmares take a rotten apple. It would make sense.

....why. This doesnt work.

Maybe you forgot the ones? That's what I forgot... after that my life was magnificent! If ya know what I mean

I regret to inform you Sansygirl, but you cannot summon a fictional character into existence.

Hmm??? What color should I use for nightmare? I cant figure a color out.

I would think of a dark blue maybe.... you know because he's always dripping ink but his eye color is blue so I kinda just mix the two

I would think that it would be a blue since they didnt have cyan. Imma try blue or dark blue. Thanks!

What would I use for dust!tale sans? Like what color candle and what to represent him? Thanks

Keep in mind this wont summon anything in the physical realm, since Sans is fictional. This might be okay for astral projection, but I don't know.

Oh... okay... But still what would I use?

Use the same ritual, but maybe before prepping yourself for projection, so that you summon it in the astral realm. Could also try a guided meditation.

Look up Dust's design and pick 1-3 main colors, and something from his aesthetic.

Okay thanks! I am thinking purple candles! But what would I use to resemble him?

Are you able to use cooked chicken bones??

You can use whatever you like, doesn't mean it will work. You cannot summon a fantasy, fictional character from a video game series, that isn't how magick works.

Fast question how can you summon the female versions of sans just asking

No, and you can't summon any other version either. He's a fictional character.

What would represent fresh other than his glasses, and the candle maybe?

This is a fake spell so it doesn't matter.

a fannypack, skate borad, think 80's

what colour candle(s) for Error!Sans? ;-;

This doesn't work because these are fictional characters and therefore can't be summoned [at best, you can pool your energy into their shape and make a thoughtform or servator, but it wouldn't be the character from the game] If you still wish to try, white is a generic stand-in for all things. If the character has a particular colour associated with them, use that.

did this work for anyone? please let me know btw what candle do i need for lust or lustswap

Use whatever candle you want this spell does not work

how big are they i want to make sure they can fit in my house and only you can see them or anyone can?

Im sorry not to be rude but if you mean this literally you are extremely wrong if Im not wrong sans is a character from the game undertale he is not real so therefor he cant be your friend of significant other magick is a force of nature so if your summoning things like gods spirits and things like that you are usually invoking them from the astral plane but sans is a video game so he does not exist in this world the afterlife or the astral plane so summoning it is virtually impossible

I don't think it's possible to summon a fictional character.

These are fictional characters therefore a spell cannot summon one

What color should I use for Ink

what if we cant get the bones

and what if we cant get candles i only have white candles from my mom but i cant use them

This spell cannot work. It is not possible to ''summon'' an imaginary, fictional character.

This particular spell will not work, as Sans is fictional, but white candles are basically a substitute for any candle color.(Also I feel your pain- I wish I could summon Sans too- :,))

This is fake and does not work.

as cool as this sounds this spell does not work, sans is a fictional character aswell as the au verions of him

I know that I am late for this stuff, but does this really work?

This specific spell, no. Undertale is a work of fiction and therefore these characters don't exist. However, you could create a thoughtform [if you know how to make psi balls, you would then form the energy into the character and make, essentially, an imaginary friend you would give energy to in exchange for the beings protection/companionship/whatever you want it for] It might even be possible to work with an egregore if the character [when enough people believe in something, they unknowingly feed energy into a thoughtform and in a way, make it a spirit] however, this specific spell isn't how you make thoughtforms, so I wouldn't waste time on that. Research thoughtforms, servitors, and egregores and see if you wish to work with them.

What's a psi?

psi is short for ''psychic.'' If you're seeing the term ''psi ball'' it's a ball of magickal energy you use in spells and other magickal workings. It's not visible [unless you have psychic abilities, then you may see something like a colour or outline of a shape] you'll feel the energy pulsing in your hand, some warms, possibly tingles.

Okay that sort of makes sense

It's working

You cannot ''summon'' a fictional character. This spell is fake.

what do i do if none of my candels match?

As many have stated in he above comments, this spell won't work. You can't summon a fictional character. The most you can do is create a thoughtform that resembles the character.

tried with ink, all the hope i had, wanted to have a friend for my birthday, i don't think it worked, the sketch book i used still has my bad drawings in it

It didn't work because this spell is nonsense. Real magic doesn't work like this. Perhaps you can research thoughtforms and servitors if you wish to have a companion like you stated above, but this spell isn't how you go about doing that.
