Then place your offering in the middle of the pentagram, along with the thing you chose(I Used Clothing And Now Every Time I Wear It I Disappear at will!!).

2.Chant The Following:
I Hear By Swear
To The Night Goddesses Blessing
To Use Her Shadows For Deeds
For The Listener Can Only Hear And Speak To Her
All Who Disregard Her Will Be Slain By Me And If I Do Disregard Her She May Enslave My Soul Unless She Considers For Me To Give Her A Reason Not To.
And If People Do Disregard Her I Will Do The Deed She Tells Me To Do And Have Their Souls In Her Slavery To The Darkness
I Hear By Promise This From Now Until The Day I Retire.

3.Chant this until the flames on the candles start flickering and suddenly go out. Once this happens, She is telling you she has accepted your offering and heard your call.

Listener,This Spells Cannot Be Put On Someone By You, The Person Who Wants It Done By Someone Else Tell Them It Will Not Work.
