- en: The most important thing on your birthday is that you have a crystal clear vision
    held in your mind of what it is you hope to achieve. Create a mental picture of
    where you want to be 12 months from now and focus on it with all your might.

- en: It will pay you to keep your thoughts to yourself over the next 24 hours. No
    doubt there is much you would like to say but with communications planet Mercury
    about to turn retrograde it’s probably too late. The less said now the less harm
    done later.

- en: You need to tighten up a bit on the money front, where you have been even more
    wasteful than usual of late. Find new ways to make savings and new ways to bring
    in extra income. Above all, don’t let others grow rich at your expense.

    give your opinions on a wide range of subjects and don’t be intimidated by people
    who like to claim they are “experts”. Most likely they know a lot less than you.

    with only ever come up with reasons not to do things then you clearly need a new
    set of friends. All things are possible if you wish hard enough for them.

    be sure that what you say is one hundred per cent true. If it isn’t then it could
    be you on the receiving end when your ruler Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow.

    almost certainly others are exaggerating their needs. Cancer is a hugely sensitive
    and compassionate sign but you can be a bit gullible at times as well, so watch
    out.

    a Leo is not the best person to annoy. Say what you have to say, do what you have
    to do and then move on, preferably without those who have been using you.

    the wrong hands and be used against you. Never forget that knowledge is power
    and the more you have of one the more you tend to have of the other one too.

    any way lessen your determination to do it. Sometimes you can be a bit indecisive
    but now you must go to the other extreme and be unashamedly stubborn.

    pin them down there is a very strong chance that they will try to wriggle out
    of their commitments to you later on. Don’t give them any leeway at all.

    You are entitled to your views but they are not of course the only views.

    be the case that they would rather be a friend than an enemy. What’s so bad about
    that?
