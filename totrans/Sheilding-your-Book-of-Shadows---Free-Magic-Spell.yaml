- en: This spell will take roughly 1 hour. Make sure it is impossible that you will
    be interrupted. If you are, multiple "bad" things could happen. Ground for as
    long as necessary. Get all of you energy out. Cast a shield around you. This should
    prevent everything from entering, not just negative energy. Cast the circle. Do
    not call the elements or the gods. The gods will be called later.

    both the red and the white candle. Say out loud: "I call upon the goddess for
    her wisdom is required for the bliss of protection of my book. I call upon the
    god for the force of protection. I call upon both powers to combine to create
    wise force to protect my Book of Shadows".'

- en: 'Put your hands roughly 3 inches away from the top of your book. Think of a
    energy shield surrounding it. Think of it repelling negative energy. If wanted,
    you can place a protection spell on your book. This includes a curse, and depending
    on the power, it may or may not remove your pure white magic for a few months.
    To start speak: "I wish to further protect my Book. I cast a curse to activate
    when someone finds this book and decides they want to read. May this curse be
    inflicted on thee". As you say that, think of the curse you wish to inflict being
    done to anyone. Use a stick figure, or your enemy, or whatever.'
