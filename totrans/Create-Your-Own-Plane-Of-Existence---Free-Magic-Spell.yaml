    dip your hands into the water while you tell your friend or other person to put
    on the meditation music.stare at your hands without blinkng and you shall not
    see your hands anymore. Do not panic, this is the most delicate part of this spell.

    to go hungry ever again. Carefully imagine a world being created before your very
    eyes. Next imagine a door way connected to your new world and the world you lived
    in before. Now you can break your concentration. Only you at that point can enter
    your plane but if you create another door others will be able to go.

  prefs: []

- en: Honestly I don't see why not. I see no need to have another present for the
    sake of playing the music alone. An interesting thing to try may be to ask another
    to attempt to journey to this plane with you. Both of you paying attention to
    the imagery you each receive and the individual feelings you get. Then after the
    meditation checking in with each other to see if you experienced any similarities.
    Just a thought.
