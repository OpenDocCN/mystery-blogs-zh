- en: Venus aspects to the Nodes often indicate feelings of fate when you first meet.
    These are strong love connections and are aspects that create instant attraction.
    This type of attraction is very Venusian in that it’s soft, alluring, happy, and
    pretty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, these aren’t necessarily lasting aspects. They’re often based on past
    life connections, but they don’t denote *future* connections in the same strong
    way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, you will need to look to other aspects in the chart to see whether
    there is long-term relationship potential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to push for growth together then there is a lot of potential for these relationships
    to work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    South Node in synastry. If you have one of these aspects with your partner, you’ll
    have the other as well.

    Node synastry aspect. Your first meeting just feels really important!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, the North Node person admires the more graceful, beautiful, attractive
    qualities of the Venus person. These qualities can be real, but they can also
    be more external or surface level qualities such as their social standing, appearance,
    or mannerisms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus person is drawn to the emotional maturity and inner strength of the
    North Node person, at least how they perceive that. They will often *sense* certain
    qualities in the North Node person, but they won’t know if these values are accurate
    until they know them on a deeper level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The North Node person will feel like the Venus person is the way to achieve
    their soul’s purpose. After all, this person is *trying* to learn about the qualities
    of their North Node, and at face value, the Venus person shows them all of these
    qualities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    something is standing in the way of your relationship working out over the long
    haul. The relationship needs very strong other aspects in order to continue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus conjunct North Node synastry aspect can often indicate a fling. The
    initial attraction is strong between both of you, but it will fade over time because
    the attraction is based on appearances instead of truths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus person tends to have more superficial qualities than the North Node
    person realized. Even though these qualities reflect the North Node, Venus isn’t
    a sustainable planet and Venusian qualities are typically quite surface level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the initial attraction is over, the North Node person might realize that
    their qualities don’t quite line up. The Venus person can feel like their partner
    is too intense or deep, or that they’re simply on separate pages.
  prefs: []

    relationship work, you need to develop a deeper relationship based on other qualities.

    that keep you together and work on developing those qualities.
  prefs: []

    this aspect alone isn’t indicative of a long-term partnership. Look to other aspects
    in the chart to determine the nature of the deeper relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    had flings with. This usually indicates that the meeting happened to set the stage
    for a future meeting and longer-term relationship in a future lifetime.

    relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Node sign.

    indicative of a long-term relationship, mainly because you’re falling right back
    into your relationship from a past life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the Venus person might reinforce the *past* behavior of the Nodal person.
    Being around the Venus person causes them to fall deeper into their karmic baggage,
    so it’s hard for them to progress towards their North Node.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Nodal person feels a fated quality to the relationship at first, but over
    time, they may start to feel like they’re held back from really progressing. The
    relationship is comfortable but also start to feel wrong because it’s based on
    the old *them.*
  prefs: []
