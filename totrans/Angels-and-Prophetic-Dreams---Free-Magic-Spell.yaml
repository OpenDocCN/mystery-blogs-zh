    and ask them to watch over you. When you get used to doing this and if you've
    ever heard a voice, ask them to show themselves kindly. If they do, do not be
    scared. Talk to them or say thank you.

- en: there really isn't any ''beginner'' spells. once you know ''the basics'' of
    magick [meditation, energy work, visualization] you can cast any working spell.
    you're looking for spells with few ingredients or simply a chant, but all spells
    are cast the same way, regardless of intention or amount of items. look into simple
    candle spells [take a candle, charge with energy, light it, visualize outcome]
    or a chant [charge energy, visualize outcome, say chant] these are rather simple
    with few steps.
