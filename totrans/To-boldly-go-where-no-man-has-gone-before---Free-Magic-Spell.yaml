- en: Go to your special spot. Arrange your materials the way you please. Take the
    first candle and hold it for a moment. Get into that deeper state by connecting
    with your materials. Smell the candle. Run your fingers across it. Note the differences
    between candles, how they make you feel what you picture etc. What would you think
    it was if you did not know the name and uses for it?

- en: Light each candle. Take time to think about what each candle represents as you
    draw that energy in. If using incense, light with one candle. gently shake out
    and relight with a different candle until the tip is aglow. Raise incense and
    state what is allowed in this space and what is not. For instance, no low vibrational
    beings allowed here. Higher vibrational beings/God/esses/ancestors etc I ask you
    to please protect my body whilst my spirit travels. You can cast a circle for
    this however I find it shows more trust for the beings you call if you do not.
    Just my opinion, of course. Fit this to you as you feel. Set the incense into
    the holder.

    off each dancing elemental. Bring to solar plexus and breathe deeply. With clear
    tone and intention, state the following as many times as you feel necessary.

    before you and take up the incense. Lead it around your area. Pass tea and stone
    through the smoke. Take time to simply unwind. Watch the smoke, see the shapes
    and messages that pop out. Do not give this much effort, let it come to you. When
    finished, thank elementals for dancing and extinguish flames. Take the stone and
    place on your bedside table, in your pillow, anywhere you choose. Get into bed
    or however you prepare yourself for travel. Remember the words you spoke. The
    energy you called. The beings that are right beside you, protecting you. Let it
    your thoughts drift to a soft murmur, like that of a crowded room. I find it helps
    to picture them as droplets in a river, don't focus on one but the whole. If a
    thought becomes insistent on being thought of, bring your awareness to your nostrils.
    Notice how you breath, where it goes. How your chest expands and contracts. Enjoy.

    the relaxed state required for astral projection. I do not know if it would work
    for everyone, but it seems worthy of a chance. Try it for yourself if you struggle
    with Astral Projection.
