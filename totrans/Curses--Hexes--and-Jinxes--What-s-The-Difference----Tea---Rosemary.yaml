    curses without fail.

- en: Curses show up in almost every modern day witch story from Harry Potter to fairytales,
    so it’s not surprising that non-practitioners want to know if these spells are
    actually done.

- en: Some witches choose to use jinxes, hexes, and curses in their magic, while others
    don’t. Some witches believe in the Law of 3, others don’t. Regardless of how you
    feel and what you belief, it never hurts to learn the theory behind these spells.

    how they’re cast and the effect that each spell has on its target.

- en: Jinxes are small, relatively harmless spells. When you cast a jinx, tt will
    cause your target minor annoyances that are temporary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Casting a jinx mainly makes *you* feel better about a situation. The downside
    is that you probably won’t know if it worked unless you’re super close with the
    individual.

- en: Jinxes are generally harmless towards the target but are mean-spirited. They’re
    cast when you want something negative to happen to your target. They also don’t
    last that long, although you can set a specific time period before casting a jinx.

- en: Hexes are much stronger than jinxes. These spells will send negative energy
    towards your target (depending on your intention) but the hex won’t last super
    long.

- en: Generally, a hex is either seasonal (or for a set duration of time) *or* stops
    working when the target learns their lesson. Hexes are often useful when someone
    continues to do wrong and you need them to change.
