Now let me explain further on this magic I created, you use an object of any kind such as a plant, notebook, etc. Once you have that you have to go or get something or somewhere to find that concept of choice,then you have to bind it to an object of your choice how you do that is up to you once you did that then your finish but I would make sure it worked, now you can manipulate that concept or redirect it or stop it, bind it whatever. Have fun and hopefully no one has thought of it and created it I don't want to be a complete idiot.
