# To See What Supernatural You Are

This spell is a form of a power spell, that unlocks some (not all) of the caster's abilities, if they have any. This may work within a week, 2 weeks, or even a month, so it takes patience!

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Jar

*   Honey

*   Cinnamon

*   Lime or Lemon

*   Flower Pedals - The bigger, the better

*   Paper

*   Pen/Marker - pencil not recommended

*   Rain water - or regular water

*   Coin

*   Something to draw blood

*   Thread - optional

## Casting Instructions for 'To See What Supernatural You Are'

 This spell was newly made, so I recommend charging the spell with your own energy to make it work better. Otherwise, this spell can just be useless.

**Incantation**

Meditate for about ten minutes to an hour. You can meditate however long you want. Just make sure you focus and concentrate on your energy.

Place the jar in front of you as you sit cross-legged (or however you feel comfortable). Pour water **Slowly** into the jar. Its best to use rain water. If you do not want to wait until it rains, do a rain spell. If you want a really good rain spell, just mail me.

You need just enough water to fill the bottom of the jar. If you do not want to wait for rain, use regular water, however I do not recommend this. As you are pouring the water slowly into the jar, chant the following three times:

"Cleanse me whole,
Cleanse me deep,
Take my energy,
Three times three."

Now, cut a lime or lemon and leave it on the side for later use. While adding a drop of honey, a sprinkle of cinnamon, and a half or whole of lemon or lime, chant the following two times:

"Earth grown herbs,
A witches brew,
Your energy makes my wishes come true."

Now, add the flower pedals and chant the phrase above one more time. Now, place your mouth to the jar and chant the following three times:

"Breath of life, breath of soul,
Speak the truth, dig a hole,
Bury the lies,
As it dies,
Hide it away,
Gone for today."

Take a piece of paper and write the following:

1.  Your Name
2.  Date of birth
3.  What kind of supernatural am I?
4.  Current date

Add a drop of blood on the paper and chant three times:

"Raidient fire, burning deep,
Lght the path, that I shall seek."

Flip the paper. Place the coin in the middle of the paper and fold the paper over the coin. the words you wrote and the blood should be facing outwards. You can tie a thread around it to keep it together, however this is optional. If the coin and paper falls apart, don't worry.

As you drop the coin and paper together in the jar, chant three times:

"Wishing well, can you tell,
My soul so strong,
My soul so deep,
Show me the truth,
Three times three."

Place the jar somewhere dark, for example, under your bed. If you start having bad luck, rinse the jar and its contents out immediately.

If you start feeling more powerful, with more energy, or start noticing abilities, let the jar be. Once the power and energy wares off, or when you don't want the spell to continue working anymore, rinse the jar and it's contents out. Good luck.
