This Spell has to be done with an accompanying person.
Take the water bottle and put it in front of you. Hold the conch shell to your ear and listen to the waves (actually, it's the blood in your head) for at least 30 seconds. Then put down the conch shell, close your eyes and recite the Spell:

'Goddess of Water, Goddess of the Sea, please make my desire come true.
I wish to be a Water Fairy!
I wish my wings will be (white, blue, pink, green).
I wish to have the powers of Water and (teleportation, mind-reading, super-strength, super-speed).
When I say ''I am a Water Fairy'', I will be visible ONLY to the ones I have told my secret and I will have my wings on my back.
When I say ''I am a human being'', I will be a human again.
I promise to keep this a secret and only tell my Bestest of Friends and my family.
So mote it be!'

After you have recited the Spell, fill the conch shell with water from the water bottle and drink it. Do it over and over again until the water bottle is empty.

You can not become a fairy.

Then which is the true spell of becoming one of it

Again, you cannot become a fairy. Period. Real Magik does not work like that.

Tadashi,Um.. I understand what you're saying but I need help am new in everything can you give me advice on were I should start

Start with a good beginners guide which explains what Magik is, what witchcraft is, and how to work with energy. The Basics is energy work, specifically charging, grounding, shielding and psi balls, meditation and visualization. You do not need to be a master at these skills, but having the ability to feel the flow of Magikal energy and being able to focus on a desired outcome are key to spell casting. I am aware not every can visualize, and for some meditation is impossible. However, this is where your personal experience comes in. Meditation is a way to be present. You do not shut off your brain. What brings you to the here and now? Visualization might be writing, drawing, singing or looking at a photo. How do you utilize your imagination? If you are wanting to walk a pagan path, be it Wicca, Heathen, or traditional witchcraft, you will need to research. If possible, find a reputable beginners guide for the path you wish to follow and read it. You could also use YouTube, TikTok, Podcasts and other free technology to help you. The problem is the contradictory information. Do you have a path in mind? I could help recommend resources. If you are interested in working with fairys, I suggest you begin with ancient lore and legends. If you can find folklorist they can help you get an idea of who the fair folk are and what they are like. Modern examples of the fae are typically cute little people with butterfly wings. I can guarantee you, 99% of fairys are not like that. They can be sweet, they can also be spiteful. They also have their own norms and ethics which could be seen as cruel by humans. Be respectful and do not assume they are there to help you. Never say thank you and never give them your name. Saying thank you indicates you owe them, and giving them your name gives them power over you.

Sadly, this doesn't work, though it would be awesome if it did
