- en: First Take the sheet of Paper and write your enemies name onto it, After you
    have done so then paint a black dot onto a piece of paper and chant the following
    after lighting your candle. ''_____ I call down the Wrath of hell upon you. By
    this Blasphemy I curse you ___ In the name of the Evil. I curse you In the name
    of all which is unholy. I DAMN THEE FOR BETRAYING ME I DAMN THEE FOR DISGRACING
    ME I DAMN THEE FOR ALL THE PAIN THOU HATH CAUSED ME, SO SHALL MY WILL BE DONE!
    AND SO MOTE IT BE!''

- en: Blow the candle out and pour a small drop onto the middle of the black dot go
    find your Enemies and either give this paper to them if they take it into there
    hand...Then Wrath shall befall them, Place it under there bed and until it is
    removed or burned...then they will suffer...so pretty much no ones gonna know
    to burn it..so take heed to this warning. And I suggest that you let them take
    it, then take it back and burn it after all is done and thy desire hath been met.
