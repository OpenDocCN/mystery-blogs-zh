    of the Candle Set down Lilith's and Agrat Bat Mahlat's sigils. To your left (or

    of jewelry) and sit in your prepared spot. Make contact with Lilith's and Agrat
    Bat Mahlat's sigil. Feel their energy. Once you have established the connections
    call their name three times. Feel the energy grow, and envelop you. Call their
    names three more times, noting the energy. Say "Lilith Come" and "Agrat Bat Mahlat
    Come" three times or untill you feel the energy strongly. I call them in triple
    form. If you still struggle to feel them call their names 9-12-15-18+ times more,
    allowing yourself to be entranced. Write your petition on the paper. This is incredibly
    personal and should be from the heart. Don't just copy mine out some effort in
    for them, what you put in is what you'll get back after all.

    Do not expect them to physically appear. While you might see them if you can see
    spirits, it is more likely you will feel their energy. I would also include offerings.
    Find what they like and offer it to them. I would give one offering during the
    ritual, and another of thanks once you receive your request.
