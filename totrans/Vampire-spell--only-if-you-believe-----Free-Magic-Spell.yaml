- en: In my older comments, I did not specify, but this spell is clearly for the type
    that drink blood, which are not physical beings, ergo this is fake. As for those
    who drink blood, they are not vampires. The human body cannot digest large quantities
    of blood. Blood sausage and blood pudding is one thing, a pint of blood with each
    meal is another. As for Girldeath, KitsRevenge, Witchslayer, or whatever new account
    you come up with when you inevitably get gagged, yes, there are psychic vampires,
    though I doubt they are proven by science. Most psi vampires are born, and those
    who ''become'' psi vampires do so by practicing energy manipulation, not a spell.
    On an unrelated note, why did you pick the username ''Uglyfreak'' exactly? Negative
    self talk can poison mentally and spiritually. I am sure you dislike me quite
    ferociously, otherwise I fail to see why you keep harassing me, but I hope you
    do not think so negatively of yourself. Even if it is simply a username, words
    have power, and I do not want you to bring yourself down as a result.

- en: I believe that you can do anything you set your mind to, the only barrier between
    someone and being a ''vampire'' is their own imagination, but i do believe that
    in order to become a vampire, one must also understand that the mythological definition
    of a vampire doesn't exist, and one cannot just become one of them, the term ''vampire''
    was first used in the 1700s, and was created because back then and even now (but
    rarely) there was a skin condition known as PCT that cause painful blisters and
    lesions on the skin due to exposure to sunlight, and it was believed back then
    that drinking small quantities of blood could stop the pain for a short period
    of time, this led to those people being called vampires, which then became a myth
    of the undead, i am a member of a vampire cult, i have Heliophobia, not to mention
    i am well educated on a series of subjects, and even i will tell you that they
    modern day interpretation of a ''vampire'' cannot exist on the mortal plane

- en: Vampirism (and other 'revenant' adjacent beings) also came from a lack of understanding
    of bodily decomposition. For example bodies going from rigor to being soft and
    flexible, red blood at the mouth/lips, lengthened fingernails and hair that was
    mistaken for growth when it was actually from skin shrinkage, decompositional
    gasses filling the belly and making it swell/fill. That sort of thing.
