 ## Casting Instructions for 'To Protect Your Book of Shadows'

*   Your new BoS

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Blue candle (water)

*   White candle (air)

*   Red candle (fire)

*   Brown or green candle (earth)

*   Your new BoS

All four candles should be the same size/type so they burn out in about the same length of time. Before you start your ritual, get a compass or map, and see which directions are north, south, east and west on your altar or table.

Set up all 4 candles, each one to its proper direction with the book in the middle. It's not that important which way the book is sitting as long as the 4 candles are in the right corners. Allow a little space between the candles and your book, or you may end up with drips of candle wax on the cover.

Light each candle, and after each one, say the corresponding line:

By the north, bless this book with the power of the Earth
By the south, bless this book with the power of fire
By the west, bless this book with the power of water
By the east, bless this book with the power of air

Leave the book to sit in the candle light until all 4 candles have gone out. Your book is now blessed by the Elements and ready for use.
