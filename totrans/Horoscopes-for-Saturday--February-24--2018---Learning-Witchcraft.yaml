    have any chores to finish you must get them out of the way quickly. Relationships
    and friendships are under excellent stars. At the very least you’ll be glad to
    be alive!

    it won’t be long before you get your reward. Those rewards will be bigger and
    better if you steer clear of trivial issues and trivial people. Only the big picture
    matters.
