# Write for Us Wiccan Gathering

> 来源：[https://www.wiccangathering.com/write-for-us/#0001-01-01](https://www.wiccangathering.com/write-for-us/#0001-01-01)

Wiccan Gathering is looking for writers who want to share their own perspective on Wicca, paganism, witchcraft, and other neo-pagan and occult pursuits on an ongoing basis.

 We have so much information we want to share, but not enough time to write it all! So we’ve decided that it’s time to bring others on board.

We are looking to form long-term, ongoing relationships who those of you who want to create your own unique content, and have it published in front of thousands of other Wiccans, pagans, and witches.

 ## How it’ll work

We want to stay very tightly focused and provide excellent content for our readers. We try to provide articles on topics which, if you google them, we feel aren’t covered deep enough, or don’t have reliable information.

So what we’ll do is come up with titles for the articles we’d like to pursue. We might give a few points or topics to cover within each article, along with a general word count we’re looking for. Our average article length is 2,000 words.

You’ll have the freedom to do your own research and write the articles as you see fit. When you’re done writing, we’ll go over it together. When we think it’s ready, we’ll publish it to our thousands of readers.

 As you gain experience writing for Wiccan Gathering, you’ll get more flexibility in choosing your own topics, and in outlining and writing articles as you like.

This is a great opportunity to share your wisdom and experience with the neo-Pagan community!

## Get Paid

We don’t expect you to do this for free (unless you want to), so we will offer compensation you for your efforts. Please apply and we can discuss specific compensation.

 Also, write as many or a few articles as you’d like. Our ideal arrangement would be you creating two (2) 2,000-word articles a month.

### What we’re looking for in writers

You don’t have to be a professional writer by any means! We have a comprehensive writer training that we’ll have you take. The training will give you everything you need to know to create the high-quality content that our readers expect.
