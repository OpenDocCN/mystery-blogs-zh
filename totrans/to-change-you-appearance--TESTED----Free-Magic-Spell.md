This won't physically change anything. You might create an illusion for others certain features have changed, but physically it'll be the same.

This could create a small illusion for those around you to perceive you slightly differently, but do not expect dramatic physical results.

Change smaller things like 'eye color'? (is that small?)(not that way), also if you said great goddess, then in feedback what you will offer to the goddess?
