- en: This is a spell of my own designee. it takes the casters current energy and
    much like a blood trans fusion replaces your energy with that of the moons. This
    is extremely useful because it can amplify your energy and you can transfer it
    in to other things. So like making moon water now all you need is a dark space
    with some quiet time to transfer some of the energy into the water.

    in the park or your yard just make sure the light is on the blanket. But before
    you lay out the blanket bless the space and your Items. Now take your blanket
    and lay it down. sprinkle the salt on the blanket. Now when you sit on the blanket
    put one candle behind you and the other two on ether side of you (do not light
    the candles). Meditate and clear your mind. then say the following.

- en: As outlined, this does not work. You cannot replace your body's natural energy
    with the natural energy of another. You can charge your body with energy, including
    the moons, for spells and rituals, but it will not be permanent. You will not
    gain moon powers. I also doubt this spell works because of the instruction. Why
    would you need to be silent for an hour, followed by an immediate cold show then
    sleep? And the random Latin is a red flag for me. If you do not speak a language,
    such as Latin, you should not use it in a spell. Ladin does not make a spell more
    powerful. You need to focus on the task at hand, and worrying if you are saying
    words properly, let alone not knowing what they say, can weaken a spell. At best,
    you could could use this as a dedication or ritual to worship the moon.
