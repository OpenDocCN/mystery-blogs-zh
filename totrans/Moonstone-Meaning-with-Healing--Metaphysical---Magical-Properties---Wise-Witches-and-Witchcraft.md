The shimmery gleam that emanates from a Moonstone makes it seem magical. With that gentle glow, it’s no wonder it was named after the Lunar Sphere. Our ancestors adored Moonstone for everything from talismans and [**scrying stones**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/scrying/scrying-divination-magical-crystals-basics/) to protective jewelry. So, when you think about Moonstone symbolism and meaning for your spiritual pursuits, go out and look skyward on a clear night when the moon is high. What dreams does that inspire? What memories? Those ideas can translate into your magical practices for a truly personal touch.

## Meaning & Properties

We know that the Moon influences the tides on earth. Moonstone also does this, but with one exception. Rather than water, this sacred stone meters our emotions. There is a sense of steadiness in Moonstone and a comfort in holding one.

Moonstone swirls with secrets and mystical vibrations. Somewhere inside that sphere, we can reflect on our personal Truth and what our previous and this incarnation has to teach us. For inward journeying you can not ask for a better energetic signature.

Whether it’s carried for protection or given in an act of love, Moonstone reconciles our energy to whatever is happening at that time. Do you want to sleep better and more peacefully? Put a Moonstone under your pillow (it is, after all, a “night light”). Want to become a little more mysterious? Wear a blessed Moonstone for your night on the town.

This popular metaphysical crystal comes in many colors, each of which has slightly different attributes and characteristics as follows:

*   Blue Moonstone: Also sometimes called Cat’s Eye Moonstone, this inspires improved awareness particularly for [**meditative efforts**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/prayers-meditations-visualizations/what-to-expect-from-meditation/). When you want to speak with honesty and be truly understood wear a Moonstone near your neck.
*   Gray Moonstone: Gray speaks of timelessness and neutrality. If there is an emotional situation that you should avoid, keep a Gray Moonstone nearby and touch it when you’re tempted to jump in. Gray Moonstone represents the New Moon and coming transformation and potentials.
*   Peach Moonstone: Peach is the color of youth, goodness and wellbeing (“peachy keen”). This crystal calms our spirit and allays worry. It also helps us get in touch with our inner child.
*   Pink Moonstone: The energy of Pink Moonstone can best be described as sweet and romantic with a hint of whimsy. Use this when working on tender relationships.
*   Rainbow Moonstone: Like the rainbow itself, this crystal speaks of hope and the calm after the storm. It acts as an amulet against negativity and overall “bad vibes”. It’s said that Fairies and other nature spirits have an affinity for Rainbow Moonstone.
*   White Moonstone:

This sacred stone taps into our psychic hotline and amps up its accuracy. White Moonstone can also act as a purifier for your aura.

You might find other Moonstones with hints of different hues. In this case, consider traditional [**color correspondences**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-magick/color-symbolism-meaning-and-uses-in-wicca-and-witchcraft/) as a guide to their possible uses.

By the way, a lovely attribute of Moonstone is that the surface may also reveal a kind of shape. For example, one that looks like an eye could be used against the evil eye and one with a four-pointed star could symbolize the four cardinal directions.

## Healing Properties

Moonstone is a very gentle healer. When we are stressed out and distracted, this healing crystal restores a sense of peace and centering. Perhaps this is why Moonstone works so well with the [**Heart Chakra**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witch/the-chakras-in-magical-and-neo-pagan-practices/) for overall harmony. It also aligns perfectly with the Crown Chakra for moderating the way in which we see and interact with daily reality.

Physically Moonstone is a great helpmate to women’s natural cycles from promoting fertility to easing menopause symptoms. It’s regarded as a hormonal balancing stone. Additionally, some healers use Moonstone for allaying nightmares and treating insomnia.

Emotionally Moonstone encourages us to take control of our emotions. Emotions do need expression so we can see them clearly. However, some people become overwhelmed with feelings. This is where Moonstone can help, particularly Empaths who have trouble blocking outside influences.

Spiritually, Moonstone opens the door to our spiritual gifts, particularly clairvoyance. For those who feel they have lost their faith, Moonstone is a great ally. Anyone considering a [**private pilgrimage**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/uncategorized/sacred-places-magical-sites-personal-pilgrimages/) of sorts can take Moonstone with them for improved focus on spiritual matters versus the mundane.

Moonstone embodies a kind of illumination that seeps into your aura and makes it sparkle. It helps us remember simpler times when it seemed everything was truly magical and awaken that wonder presently.
For the romantic in all of us, what is more inspiring that the shine of the Lunar sphere, or in this case Moonstone? We feel it is the stone of Joie de vivre that exalts our spirit.

There is a song that says the man in the moon is a lady. Well, metaphysically that is true. Moonstone, like its’ namesake, connects us with the Sacred Feminine. This makes it an excellent crystal for new mothers for that nurturing surge. There is a purity of love, nurturing and support in Moonstone that’s difficult to rival in the crystal realm.

*   In India Moonstone was considered so sacred that it had to be placed on a yellow cloth for showing which is the color of sanctity
*   Asian myths tell us that you can only gather Blue Moonstone every 21 years, washed to the ground by the tide.
*   In Rome Moonstone was sacred to Diana the Goddess of the moon. Diana resided over wealth, wisdom and love.

It naturally enhances your artistic and prophetic ability.

## Magical Properties

Witches and magicians, both past and present, planned their spells and ritual by the [**phases of the moon**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-magick/new-moon-magic-the-four-quarters/). So it’s not surprising to see Moonstone included as an amplifying crystal in various magical endeavors.

One of the most common applications for Moonstone was in [**love magic**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/love-spells/love-spells-for-couples/). Those looking for true love or people hoping to improve their relationship might be given an enchanted Moonstone with specific instructions on how to use it. Often these directions included carrying the stone until the next moon cycle began.

Going one step further it appears that Moonstone boosts kundalini energy, heating up matters in the bedroom. Here it also stresses fertility for those wanting children and overall fidelity. For this purpose, you might put Moonstones at the head and foot of the bed.

For Sacred Dancers, having a Moonstone opens the fissures of self-expression. Those watching you will feel your heart and soul in each movement. This also applies to other performing arts.
Many a traveller used Moonstone, ensuring the safety of their journey. Sometimes they kept it in water under the moonlight for this purpose. We might translate that as adding it to a [**crystal elixir**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-wiccan-potions/witches-brews-magic-potions-elixirs-and-tinctures/) or a protective power pouch.

## Mineral Properties

Moonstone belongs to the feldspar group in geology. It, like Labradorite, has adularescence – a display of light and color that seems to come from within. It rates as a 6-6.5 on Mohs Hardness scale, which makes it relatively tough. It does not take well, however, to sudden changes in temperature which may cause breakage. Generally, gemologists say that washing Moonstone in plain soap and water works better than ultrasonic cleaning.

Moonstone’s color affects its value. Blue is highly sought after. The key deposits of Moonstone are those in Sri Lanka, Burma, Brazil, India and Madagascar.

## Name Etymology

Moonstone was sometimes called Selenite, a term that comes from the Greek Goddess of the moon. Many of the names for Moonstone in other languages point to those cultures associating it with the moon as well. One example in Hindi is the term <e.>chandrakant, meaning beloved of the moon.</e.>
