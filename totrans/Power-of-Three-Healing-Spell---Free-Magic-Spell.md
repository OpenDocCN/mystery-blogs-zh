 Anoint each of the candles with the oils and set them up in an even triangle shape on your altar. Anoint the stones as well, and place them in front of each candle. Write the name of the ill person on each piece of paper and set them in the middle of the triangle. Light each candle and focus on the person who is sick. Think about them being healthy and free of their symptoms. Picture them strongly in your mind as the candles burn. Repeat the following three times: 

"Magic mend and candle burn, illness leave and health return."

Leave the candles to burn for 3 hours, then snuff them out. Your subject should soon start to improve, but you can add some power to your spell if you do the entire ritual for 3 nights in a row rather than just once.
