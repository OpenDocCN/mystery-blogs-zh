- en: In using the Goddess image as a focus this spell is representational. It uses
    a mirror to represent light and power and also uses numerology (the power of numbers)
    in the nine white candles. Nine signifies pure spirituality and therefore the
    highest energy available.

    Turn slowly in each direction, ensuring that you throw the light as far as you
    can in each direction. Then spin round as many times as you have candles, continuing
    to project the light and say: "Goddess of love, goddess of light, Protect this
    space".'

- en: Pinch out the candles and put them away safely until you need to use them again.
    This technique is slightly unusual in that you pinch out the candles rather than
    allowing them to burn down. This is because it is the intensity of light which
    is required not the length of time it burns. This is a good way of rededicating
    your sacred space whenever you feel it necessary..
