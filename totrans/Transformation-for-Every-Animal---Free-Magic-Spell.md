# Transformation for Every Animal

This may not work. Don't get mad at me. Use it to transform into whatever animal.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Transformation for Every Animal'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Crystal ball

*   5 Pieces of grass

*   Dead rose

*   2 Towels

*   6 Red Candles

*   Bird feather

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Crystal ball

*   5 Pieces of grass

*   Dead rose

*   2 Towels

*   6 Red Candles

*   Bird feather

 Light the 6 red candles and put them into a circle. Lay the grass in the middle with the feather on top of it. Now take the crystal ball and rub it as you chant: "Let me see a bird in the sky, a wolf howling, a hawk screeching".

Take the towels, get it soaking wet. Let the water drip onto the dead rose. Throw the rose in the woods, preferably near a tree and high enough a bird could see it. Blow out the candles and do the same with them as you did the rose. Follow suit with both the grass and feather.
