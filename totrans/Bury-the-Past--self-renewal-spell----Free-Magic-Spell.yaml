- en: This is a spell to help you shake off an old part of yourself that you don't
    need anymore. It takes the form of a mock-funeral where you symbolically lay your
    past-tendencies to rest to make way for newer, healthier ones.

- en: This spell is best cast at night during a waning moon. If you're going to use a
    circle, cast it widdershins (counter-clockwise). Note that this spell can't change
    your sexual orientation or things about you that are core parts of your personality,
    and it can't be directed at someone else. Also, the spell will only work if you
    really, earnestly want to change, so put all stubbornness aside.

    fear of being bullied, scorned and rejected. Never did she venture to make friends,
    so greatly did the wide world frighten her. May the cool, peaceful earth still
    her constant shaking"'

- en: Fold a different sheet of paper into a box to use as a "coffin". If you don't
    know how to do this, there are various books and websites with step-by-step instructions
    to help you. Wooden and tin boxes can work too, but try to keep it small. Once
    you have your coffin, fold up the slip of paper with your description on it and
    place it inside. Close the box and use the marker on the lid to draw a cross,
    pentagram or whatever you find significant.

- en: Go outside (if you're not already outside), make sure you have all your supplies,
    and cast your circle. Dig a small hole near the center of the circle, 4-5 inches
    deep. Place the paper coffin inside the hole, focusing on what you are symbolically
    burying and why. If you have flower petals, sprinkle them over the coffin now.
    Place a small rock near the head of the grave to serve as a "tombstone", and place
    an unlit candle at the foot of the grave. Take this time to reflect on death and
    rebirth in your life. If you want, you can further dress the grave with extra flowers
    or a little drawing on the tombstone.

- en: When you're ready, light the candle and say a eulogy. It can be as simple or
    elaborate as you want, depending on how much you like the funeral imagery. If
    you can't think of anything to say, "may they rest in peace"  is a good one-sentence
    eulogy. Once you're done, cover the grave in dirt and whisper, "so mote it be".
    Take a deep breath and close the circle. Leave the grave-site to be washed away
    by the weather.

    away very soon, but you have to make your own effort to change as the spell works. Remember,
    you cannot be renewed if you don''t want to be renewed. If you outwardly say that
    the way you are doing things is harmful or preventing growth, but you don''t feel
    that way on the inside and don''t want to stop, then you''re stuck. You''re like
    a tree with dead branches: release your grip on them, let them fall, and soon
    new branches will sprout and blossom around you.'
