- en: In aspect to the ascendant, Lilith will show how “taboo” your outer mask appears
    to the world, how alluring, taboo, sexual, or Scorpionic you seem.
  id: totrans-6

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These Lilith-ascendant aspects can be good or bad since taboo is exciting to
    others but can also be scary or too intense. Typically, these Lilith-ascendant
    aspects both attract and repel at the same time.

- en: The Lilith conjunct Ascendant aspect means that you are interesting and captivating.
    You may come off as mysteriously sexual, kind of witchy, or you might give off
    the obscure vibe that there “something” more under the surface. This aspect makes
    you seem kind of Scorpionic, like a mystery, which is appealing but can also be
    a bit scary.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your sex appeal may feel somewhat dark, so you could try to appear inconspicuous
    at times. Or perhaps you embrace this sex appeal and make it work for you (such
    as Billie Eilish, who has this Lilith conjunct Ascendant aspect).
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that Lilith conjunct Ascendant doesn’t mean that you *look* dark
    or sexual, but that you have a darker *energetic* appeal. Others always tend to
    think there’s more underneath your surface.
  id: totrans-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You might attract others and enjoy the attention, which often seems to be on
    you. But you may notice that others are intimidated by you, too, which can actually
    make people want to avoid you. Your “mask” is a push-pull: you seem taboo, which
    is both exciting and scary.'
  id: totrans-12

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people with Lilith conjunct Ascendant can seem almost haughty. With this
    placement, it can help if you work to be more approachable and open, softening
    your Lilith without changing who you are. You appear closed and secretive, so
    working to balance that image can help attract people.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Others are either afraid of you or obsessed with you – many people tend to idolize
    you before they even know you. This may happen for no reason at all since this
    aspect doesn’t necessarily indicate that you’re outgoing.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lilith conjunct Ascendant can be a tough placement to have. But you *can* work
    with this aspect to display the higher vibrational qualities of Lilith instead
    of the more taboo, edgy, scary qualities.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Be careful that you don’t start thinking you’re better than others because
    of how you attract people. You might also *act* like you’re better than others,
    almost without realizing it: this is Lilith’s way of covering up her inner shame.
    But this actually gives you an opportunity to figure out what you feel ashamed
    about and *why* you’re afraid to embrace these taboo qualities within yourself.'
  id: totrans-16

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Lilith conjunct Ascendant, you simply can’t ignore the wild woman within.
    So find out how to express Lilith in a way that is *most* authentic with who you
    are inside.

    it: Lilith creatures a *strong* draw in your outer mask. You exude an intense,
    powerful, and even taboo energy that people are strongly attracted to.'
  id: totrans-19

- en: You are naturally magnetic with Lilith trine Ascendant. While you may be a bit
    intimidating to others, this usually works out in your favor (unlike the conjunction).
    You seem *different, *and while this difference feels taboo, people generally
    enjoy your energy.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Lilith conjunct Ascendant manifests as ultra-sexual looks (such as
    Margot Robbie) that draw people, while other times you simply appear Scorpionic,
    taboo, and mysterious in a compelling energetic sense (such as Charlie Sheen and
    even Ted Bundy).
  id: totrans-21

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect can even mean that while you’re closed up on the outside, others
    just *sense* that deepness in you.

    aspect gives you the opportunity to show the world how you are unique in a way
    that is natural for you.

    magnetic. Others are drawn to your energy.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may not show this more Lilith side to others as a child – this energy is
    developed over time. The more you accept Lilith within yourself, the more this
    energy will show up in your mask.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lilith sextile Ascendant gives you the opportunity to incorporate this magnetism
    into yourself as you accept every part of yourself, even your most taboo side.
    When you uncover those taboos and find out *you* are, when you integrate that
    shadow Lilith into yourself, then you can integrate that part of you into your
    mask and show your most authentic self to others.

  id: totrans-28

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have Lilith opposition Ascendant, you may find Lilith-like partners.
    This can be confusing to others because you *seem* innocent. And even if others
    know that you’re not innocent, you just always come off as kind of *young*.
  id: totrans-29

- en: For example, Bernie Sanders has Lilith opposition Ascendant. While we all know
    that Bernie Sanders has many years under his belt and strong political opinions,
    he has a vague childlike energy that manifests due to this opposition.
  id: totrans-30

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lilith is completely hidden in your mask, part of your shadow self. So you come
    across as cute or innocent, as someone with no “bad” or mysterious parts. At the
    very least, you appear open, almost to the point of naivete. Even if you do something
    that should technically be taboo, people may think that you just don’t know better.
  id: totrans-31
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Lilith still lives inside of you. Because you *also* have Lilith conjunct
    Descendant, the best way to bring Lilith out is in your partnerships. She truly
    is part of your shadow self, so Lilith *must* be integrated into your personality
    in order to feel comfortable with her.
  id: totrans-32
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you integrate Lilith, others may still see you as innocent, but you will
    feel more comfortable with this image because *you* will know that Lilith lives
    within you.
  id: totrans-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are married or in a relationship, then your partner may appear more Lilith
    than you do. Logically this makes no sense since you have plenty of Lilith inside,
    but it’s just how you seem together – like you’re the innocent one.
  id: totrans-34

    done anything bad. You always get the benefit of the doubt.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Lilith square Ascendant, your personality/mask may be off-putting to others.
    Even when you try to seem pleasing, people still see the worst qualities of your
    Lilith expressed in the ascendant. Those Lilith-related taboos come out in a way
    that makes others nervous.
  id: totrans-37
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You still have a *captivating* side to your personality like any other Lilith-Ascendant
    aspect, but this element of your personality tends to scare people and push them
    away. A prime example of Lilith square Ascendant is Johnny Depp, who exudes dark
    vibes that seem almost scary or angsty but are not exactly explainable.
  id: totrans-38
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Lilith square Ascendant, you may have the aura of being surrounded by death
    or scandal, or perhaps you just have an unexplainably taboo energy. Others feel
    nervous in general, as though you’re hiding a deep dark secret (even if this is
    not true).
  id: totrans-39
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a tough placement. However, you *must* work to accept the rejected part
    of Lilith within yourself in order to heal this aspect. If you don’t heal Lilith
    then you will try to suppress her, but she comes out sideways. With Lilith square
    Ascendant, you must learn to show the truest expression of yourself, even if others
    don’t like it.
  id: totrans-40
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, you’ll actually become more appealing to others once your Lilith
    is integrated. The “scary” parts will be more apparent and therefore more manageable.
