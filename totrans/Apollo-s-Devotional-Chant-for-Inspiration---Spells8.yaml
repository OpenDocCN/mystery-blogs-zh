- en: In Greek and Roman mythology, Apollo is a standout god, born to Zeus and Leto
    and twin to the huntress [Artemis](https://spells8.com/artemis-devotional/). Over
    time, Apollo and the sun god [Helios](https://spells8.com/helios-devotional/)
    started to blend in people’s minds, similar to how Artemis got linked with [Selene](https://spells8.com/selene-devotional/),
    the moon goddess. Despite this confusion in religious circles, myths and literature
    always kept Apollo and Helios, as well as Artemis and Selene, separate. The Etruscans
    also honored him as Aplu, showing Apollo’s wide-reaching influence in ancient
    cultures.
