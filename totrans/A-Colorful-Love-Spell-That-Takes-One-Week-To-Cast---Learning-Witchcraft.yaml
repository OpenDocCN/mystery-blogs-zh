- en: This powerful love spell is used to attract romance. It uses the power of all
    seven colors of the rainbow and casts the spell over a period of seven days so
    that each of the major planets, as well as the sun and moon, provide strength
    to the spell. The spell is one of the more powerful options in the grimoire and
    it is important that you plan the casting in advance to ensure success.

    When casting the love spell, arrange the different candles in the holders on an
    altar moving from violet on the left to red on the right. The other candles must
    be placed between these according to their position in the rainbow.
