Place your hands in a fist above your head, and make a downward ripping motion, like you are ripping off the cocoon.

This could be used to help you move past an emotion, but even negative emotions have purpose. Learn from it, ask yourself why you feel this way, and how you can use it for positive reasons. Suppressing and ignoring negative emotions will force them further down into your shadow and cause more damage in the long run.
