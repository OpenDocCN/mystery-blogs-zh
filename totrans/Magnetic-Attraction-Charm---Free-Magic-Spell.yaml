- en: You can use the literal attraction power of a magnet to help bring someone into
    your life. This is a good spell when you don't actually have someone specific
    in mind, but just want to attract someone into your life.

- en: Lodestone can be hard to find, so you may have to check out the crystal displays
    at your local New Age or occult shops. An actual pendant would be nice, but it's
    not necessary.

- en: Hold the stone in your hands, and rub a little rose and vanilla oil into it.
    Picture the stone drawing energy in to you, and bringing that special someone
    into your life. Tie the stone on to the thread to make a necklace of sorts. You
    can carry it in your pocket if you prefer, but having it around your neck makes
    a stronger spell.

- en: Get out and spend some time in social groups, to give the stone a chance to
    draw that person to you.
