Recite this incantation:

"Above is the sky that I hold, and below is the earth that I mold,

Within the mountain the fire burns, beneath the surface the water churns,

I seek sanctuary from that which holds me wrong

Thus I plea and sing the Creator's song

As my drums beat transcends the heavens through the sky

My feet stomp and shake the earth and send my cry

My spirit dances pure and strong, and the Creator's light pierces the veil

You shall not bear me harm, and my faith and love will not fail

Be gone now this day never to return, in the name of the old one

By air and sky, and sea, by fire let my spirit be free and done."

Once done let the candle burn out and then bury it, pour the water over the buried candle.
