- en: I know Bealtaine was a little bit ago, but I don’t think I have spoken about
    my experience here yet. **I wanted to tell you about the experience I had for
    my Bealtaine ritual this year and my communication with Brighid**, the Irish goddess
    I worship and honor. If you didn’t already know, I am an Irish pagan and I practice
    witchcraft outside of my religious practice. I have been honoring Brighid for
    almost an entire year at this point, so I wanted to do some work with Her on Bealtaine.

  zh: 我知道贝尔坦是有一段时间了，但我想我还没有在这里谈论我今年贝尔坦仪式的经历。**我想告诉你一下我今年贝尔坦仪式的经历，以及我与布里吉德交流的经历**，这位我崇拜和敬重的爱尔兰女神。如果你还不知道，我是一位爱尔兰异教徒，在宗教实践之外也从事巫术。我已经在这一点上几乎一整年在尊敬布里吉德了，所以我想在贝尔坦节和她一起做些工作。

  zh: 她会接受我的奉献吗？
- en: For several months I had been tossing around the idea of dedicating to Brighid
    - *dedicating myself to Her service and the things that She needs to be done*.
    I wanted to dedicate myself to Her and bring Her into the “every day” for everyone
    else - **to encompass what She stands for in my life**. I had been tossing around
    that idea for a while. Dedicating myself to Her would mean the world to me, but
    I don’t take dedication lightly and I would never dedicate myself to Her service
    if She didn’t want me. In my opinion, it is rude to assume that a deity would
    want me in Their service anyway without me having asked Their permission.

  zh: 几个月来，我一直在思考要把自己奉献给布里吉德的想法 - *把自己奉献给她的服务和她需要完成的事情*。我想把自己奉献给她，并把她带入每个人的“日常生活”中
    - **在我的生活中体现她所代表的一切**。我一直在思考那个想法。把自己奉献给她对我来说意味着很多，但我不轻易做出这样的决定，如果她不想要我，我绝不会把自己奉献给她的服务。在我看来，假设神灵会想要我在没有询问她们的许可的情况下服务她们是很无礼的。
- en: '*Honestly, dedication and being oathbound and contracting with deities and
    other beings - it’s a serious topic and it’s not something that should be done
    lightly. So, that’s why I didn’t just willy-nilly do it. Even though I’ve been
    working with Her and honoring Her and giving Her offerings, it’s not something
    to just hop right into. However, that’s a topic for another discussion!*'

- en: But on **Bealtaine** - or Beltane - I did my ritual. I went into my living room.
    I sat in front of my woodburning stove. I lit my candles and I called out to Her.
    I meditated on the idea of dedicating to her. *I could feel Her presence literally
    everywhere*. It was the most intense meditation experience and communication I
    have ever had with Her. My answer?

    fact that She didn’t think I was ready. She also told me that I did not know enough
    to be considered acceptable for Her service.

  zh: 说实话，在这一点上，这并不让我感到惊讶，因为**深在我心底，我知道**我并不准备把自己奉献给她的服务。不仅仅是因为她认为我还不准备好。她还告诉我，我知识不足，还不能被视为适合她的服务。
- en: I’m not going to sit here and say that I know everything that needs to be known
    about Brighid and Irish paganism enough to dedicate my path to Her and to Irish
    paganism in general. **I got a resounding absolutely not - you are totally not
    ready for this.** And She said that I’m not ready because I don’t know enough.
    She wants me to learn Her language and learn Her stories, but not just Her stories
    - the stories of Ireland and the Tuatha de Danann and the mythology and the folklore.
    And She said then, maybe you’ll be ready. And I have never felt like that during
    a meditation.

  zh: 我不会坐在这里说我已经知道关于布里吉德和爱尔兰异教主义需要知道的一切。**我得到了一个响亮的绝对否定 - 你完全还没有准备好。** 她说我还不准备好是因为我还不了解足够多。她希望我学会她的语言，了解她的故事，但不仅仅是她的故事
    - 还有爱尔兰的故事，图塔·德·丹南的故事，神话和民间传说。她说，也许那时你就准备好了。而我从未在冥想中感受到那样的感觉。
- en: I wasn’t even disappointed, really. **It was more of a realization** - seeing
    clearly what I knew to be true. She said no, and that’s okay. I have never received
    messages that strong before from Gods or guides - *it was so powerful* and I’m
    not sure if it’s because I did the ritual on Bealtaine when the veil between this
    world and the Otherworld is thinnest, as they say, or if She just wanted to come
    through and deliver a powerful message and answer to my question.

  zh: 实际上，我甚至并没有感到失望。**这更像是一个觉悟** - 清晰地看到我知道是真实的事情。她说不，那也没关系。我从未从神灵或指导中收到过那么强烈的信息
    - *它是如此强大*，我不确定是因为我在贝尔塔尼做了仪式，当时这个世界与彼岸之间的面纱最薄，正如他们所说的那样，还是因为她只是想传递一个强有力的信息并回答我的问题。
- en: And even though She said no, **I’m not discouraged. I’m not disappointed**.
    If anything, it is a push for me to do better and work harder. But it’s also a
    validation that I’m on the right path - that I am following the steps that I need
    to follow in the direction that I need to go. And I say this because I have never
    in my pagan experience received messages that powerful or felt the energy and
    the strength from those messages like that before. **So, I have a lot of learning
    to do still. And that’s okay! There’s nothing wrong with that.**

  zh: 尽管她说了不，**我并不气馁。我也并不失望**。如果有什么的话，这让我更有动力做得更好，更加努力。但这也是我正在正确的道路上的验证 - 我正在追随我需要追随的步骤，朝着我需要前进的方向。我这样说是因为在我作为异教徒的经历中，我从未接收过那么强烈的信息或感受到那些信息带来的能量和力量。**所以，我还有很多需要学习的地方。而这没问题！这没有错。**

    to say. She is the first goddess that I have sought out on my own and that I have
    worked closely with because, when I was Wiccan, **it always felt very impersonal
    to me**. Lord and Lady. God and Goddess. Like, okay, but who are they? And I know
    in some traditions, Wiccans choose from a pantheon and worship or honor those
    deities, but that never felt right to me. So, Wicca always felt so impersonal.
    And this experience with my Bealtaine ritual just lets me know that **I am going
    in the right direction.**

  zh: 布里吉德是我与之建立关系的第一个女神，我想这么说。她是我自己寻求并与之密切合作的第一个女神，因为当我是女巫时，**对我来说总是感到非常不个人化**。主和夫人。神和女神。像，好吧，但他们是谁？我知道在某些传统中，女巫会从众神中选择并崇拜或敬仰那些神祇，但那从未对我感觉正确。所以，女巫教总是让我感到很不个人化。而我在贝尔塔尼仪式中的这种经历只是让我知道**我正在朝正确的方向前进。**
