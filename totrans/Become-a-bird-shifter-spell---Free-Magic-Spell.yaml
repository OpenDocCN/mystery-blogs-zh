- en: I believe magick is not able to change a person's body shape, as it's simply
    not possible. Sorry to break it to you believers but this spell is fake, so do
    not waste time and energy trying to become a bird with this method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately such magick like said in your spell is not physically possible
    in the physical realm, further more its against the laws of physics to alter your
    dna to make your shift to a bird
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lets say this would work. how would you be able to even change back? like why
    would you spend the rest of your life as a bird just to possibly die sooner?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For argument, let's say it works [it doesn't, but let's pretend] you could try
    recasting it, only to change the wording in the chant to say you want to be human.
    If that fails, you're stuck as a bird. People don't think through spells, they
    just go ''cool, I could be a bird'' without thinking a few moves ahead.
