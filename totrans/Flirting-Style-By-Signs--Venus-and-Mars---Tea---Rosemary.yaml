    project their idea of romance onto you.

    demure, and self-sacrificing. You often have deep eyes that draw the other in.

    attracts those with more bold flirting signs.
  prefs: []

    a bit tougher. With masculine energy, you are mainly focused on finding a soul-mate
    connection, even if it’s just for a night. You’re affectionate, romantic, and
    sensuous. You do have a deep, mysterious sense about you that feminine energy
    flocks to.
