# A BFF Frozen Mermaid Spell

Want to look like Elsa with your BFF? Well. Good thing you came to me, MerFaith14!!!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'A BFF Frozen Mermaid Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A BFF

*   A cup

*   1 or 2 ice cube(s)

*   Spring water

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A BFF

*   A cup

*   1 or 2 ice cube(s)

*   Spring water

 If your BFF is with you, only put in one ice cube, to represent the both of you.  If your BFF isn’t near, put in 2 ice cubes.  When you do the spell, do it via FaceTime if your BFF isn’t near, if your BFF is near, do it then.  Put the ice cube(s) in the cup and fill it with nice, cold spring water.  Say this TWICE together AT THE SAME TIME while putting your hands on top of the cup:

”Crystalizing ice and snow let this Mer Elsa Transformation flow.  I’m here with my BFF.  Provide us with what will come next!  

Icey mermaids we will be, when we frolic about the vast springs and seas!”

your powers and transformation will appear on Christmas Day.  

Side affects:

1\.  Humming, Let It Go

2\.  Night chills

3\.  Blue, glittery legs

4\.  Blonde streaks of hair

Your tail should look like Elsa’s blue snowflake gown, if not, well... you may have done the spell wrong and you are probably a creature you didn’t want to be.
