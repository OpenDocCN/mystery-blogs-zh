    is. It’s a form of divination that employs a black mirror as a focal point to
    induce a meditative or trance-like state. By gazing into the mirror, practitioners
    claim to tap into deeper levels of consciousness, leading to visions or insights.

    but you can also use an obsidian crystal or make your own.

    It can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks,
    and Celts. The Egyptians, for instance, used dark, polished surfaces like obsidian
    for divinatory practices. Nostradamus is said to have used a black mirror to foresee
    events. Even today, it holds a place in various esoteric traditions, including
    modern Wicca and other pagan practices.

    limits reflections, creating a void-like focal point that aids in achieving a
    meditative state, which can be difficult with a regular mirror and a lot of light.

    darker realms, connect with Chthonic deities, or communicate with your unconscious
    mind.** All things darker are easily accessed through a black mirror. Note that
    darker doesn’t mean back – it’s simply a different kind of energy. I use black
    mirror scrying quite often in [Qliphothic work](https://teaandrosemary.com/the-qliphoth-tree/)
    because it’s the perfect association for the void.'

    the mirror’s physical surface. Think of the mirror as a gateway to an unspecified
    realm that lies beyond it; this will help your mind naturally enter the required
    state for effective scrying.

    should do the trick. Hold the mirror flat and directly in front of you in such
    a way that you don’t see your own reflection, but instead are met with a vague,
    dark expanse.
