  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let’s quickly recap what black mirror scrying
    is. It’s a form of divination that employs a black mirror as a focal point to
    induce a meditative or trance-like state. By gazing into the mirror, practitioners
    claim to tap into deeper levels of consciousness, leading to visions or insights.

    mirror, only you’ll be using a black, shiny surface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    like a regular mirror with black backing instead of silver. Some are available
    for purchase custom-made ([these are my favorite ones on Etsy](https://rstyle.me/+kTgMUMDvECOsLtilXiOYtg))
    but you can also use an obsidian crystal or make your own.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The history of black mirror scrying is deep-rooted and crosses multiple cultures.
    It can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks,
    and Celts. The Egyptians, for instance, used dark, polished surfaces like obsidian
    for divinatory practices. Nostradamus is said to have used a black mirror to foresee
    events. Even today, it holds a place in various esoteric traditions, including
    modern Wicca and other pagan practices.

- en: Why Use a Black Mirror?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Black mirrors are believed to help minimize distractions. Their dark surface
    limits reflections, creating a void-like focal point that aids in achieving a
    meditative state, which can be difficult with a regular mirror and a lot of light.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**More specifically, black mirror scrying is great when you want to see into
    darker realms, connect with Chthonic deities, or communicate with your unconscious
    mind.** All things darker are easily accessed through a black mirror. Note that
    darker doesn’t mean back – it’s simply a different kind of energy. I use black
    mirror scrying quite often in [Qliphothic work](https://teaandrosemary.com/the-qliphoth-tree/)
    because it’s the perfect association for the void.'

- en: When you scry using a black mirror, the key is to shift your gaze slightly beyond
    the mirror’s physical surface. Think of the mirror as a gateway to an unspecified
    realm that lies beyond it; this will help your mind naturally enter the required
    state for effective scrying.
  prefs: []

- en: For optimal results, use soft, dim, and indirect lighting—just a couple of candles
    should do the trick. Hold the mirror flat and directly in front of you in such
    a way that you don’t see your own reflection, but instead are met with a vague,
    dark expanse.

    guidelines you should consider when making your own. Firstly, opt for a round
    or oval mirror instead of a square one. I personally love vintage frames.
  prefs: []

    the glass and clean both sides thoroughly, making sure they’re completely dry.
    Hold the spray can about 20 inches away from the glass and lightly spray just
    one side, moving the can side-to-side to ensure an even coat. Allow the paint
    to dry before adding additional layers.
  prefs: []

    opaque. Place the glass back into the frame, making sure the unpainted side faces
    outward. Keep your mirror pristine; even a tiny smudge or fingerprint can be a
    distraction while scrying.
