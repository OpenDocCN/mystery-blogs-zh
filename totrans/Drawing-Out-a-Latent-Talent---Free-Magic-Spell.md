"As I sleep, I shall learn of my best potential".

You must then wear the charm bag for a full twenty-four hours to allow the spell to work. After that time you can place the charm bag under your pillow the night before anything important is to happen when you feel youneed some extra help in reaching your goals. Sleeping and dreaming are often the best way we have of self-development. Most of us have secret ambitions but are prevented by doubts from succeeding. This spell helps to make those fears irrelevant.
