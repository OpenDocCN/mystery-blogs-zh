    dandelions because they're sunny, easy to find, and the stems twist together more
    easily.

    but I added some lines for those who are looking toward fixing things with someone
    more ''special.'' Adjust as needed.

    you're done, pluck it off. Hold the end with your toes (that's what I did) and
    tie it at the top under the flowers and at the end of the stems so that it doesn't
    fall apart.

- en: Dig a shallow hole about as long as the flowers, and bury them with the petals
    peeking out of the hole. To represent freedom, tick the two feathers in the ground
    next to the flowers. While you're doing this, it would be a good idea to chant
    something along the lines of ''free to be.''
