    asteroid in astrology. If you’re just beginning your journey with asteroids, I
    recommend starting with Chiron! Today, I’m diving right into Chiron in Aries.

    this wound can feel really painful, it can be transformed and used for good. We
    always have our Chiron signs for a good reason.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    wound deep down for our whole lives without ever addressing it. No one feels good
    living with the negative effects Chiron forever!

- en: Chiron is probably that thing that you just can’t ignore. Even though it’s really
    painful, the wound pops up over and over. This is why it’s so important to just
    deal with it, as painful as that might be at first.

- en: The Chiron wound can come from a lot of different types of trauma, but the outcome
    is always similar in any specific sign. In Aries, the Chiron wound is all about
    a core **feeling of worthlessness**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is supposedly one of the most difficult yet important Chiron placements,
    although I tend to find that *all* Chiron placements are really painful. The reason
    that Aries can be so difficult is because it’s directly related to who you are
    as a person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think of the typical Aries, you’ll notice that they are generally sure
    of themselves, confident, bold, and daring, which sometimes can even cause problems
    for them if these qualities become too extreme. Chiron in Aries is the *exact
    opposite* of the normal Aries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with the placement of Chiron in Aries will often feel that they lack some
    sort of *core self* or that something is somehow wrong with them. They won’t feel
    sure of themselves or appear confident at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They may feel that they’re unfocused, uncentered, or that they just generally
    don’t belong. They may see everyone else in life moving along with a purpose but
    feel that they weren’t given one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to exist or that they are somehow a mistake.
  prefs: []

    it and begin to heal it, but this wound can also be extremely transformative as
    it heals.
  prefs: []

    *always* has a very important purpose in the world!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two different ways that the Chiron in Aries wound can show itself.
    These methods of showcasing the wound are exact opposites, but they all stem from
    the same issue of not having a purpose or a sense of self that feels like it’s
    worth something.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**In the first scenario, the person may seek to please others and be intensely
    influenced by others.** They’re more like Libran people in nature, and will go
    out of their way (to the extreme detriment of themselves) to make others happy
    and get even the smallest bit of praise.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These Chiron in Aries folks aren’t feeding on this praise like a Leo would be,
    but instead *need* it to keep themselves together and to assure themselves that
    they have some type of purpose on earth. They probably feel that if they can at
    least make other people happy then they have some worth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The individual will basically dedicate themselves to making others happy, but
    it will be at the expense of themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They will also struggle when in a group and different people want different
    things from them. They will choose the person who can offer the biggest reward
    (the person who’s praise means the most) and can be unintentionally cliquey because
    of this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, these people try to avoid taking any type of stand or getting involved
    in conflict or confrontation. They’ll usually choose careers or lifestyle paths
    where little opinion is required of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They might also try to rescue others who lack self-worth; they’re pretty good
    at recognizing these same character traits in others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This person is simply trying to prove that they can fit in with the crowd and
    therefore are not wrong or a mistake. The first step is for this individual to
    realize that trying to please others doesn’t bring them any lasting satisfaction,
    and that they were never a mistake in the first place, even if they may *feel*
    wrong inside.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These Chiron in Aries folks have a really hard time standing up for themselves,
    even when they know they should. The fear of “reopening” the wound keeps them
    from taking a stand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'They can also self-sabotage at times. They might almost intentionally (even
    though it feels unintentional to them) sabotage a relationship, a career, or anything
    else. They’re basically proving to themselves that they *don’t* have any worth,
    but this is because of the wound: this is just a false belief.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for what they need or even a right to exist. They feel like their very being is *wrong.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most people don’t recognize the Chiron in Aries placement when the wound expresses
    itself this way because these qualities are all opposite from typical Aries qualities.
    This individual is suppressing all Aries qualities in order to try and find a
    way to make the wound less painful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do find that people with Chiron in Aries might have a lot of underlying rage.
    This is typically the person who *appears* passive, sweet, and malleable, but
    underneath they’re just seething with frustration and anger that they have to
    hide.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Alternatively, the person might turn aggressive, showy, inflexible, and even
    selfish.** This individual *still* feels just as unworthy because of the Chiron
    in Aries wound, but they have the opposite reaction: they focus completely on
    themselves to try and “fix” the wound.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These Chiron in Aries people also feel like their very existence is wrong or
    that something is wrong with their soul, so they try to get attention to *prove*
    to themselves that it isn’t true. The problem is that they get all the wrong types
    of attention, so they never really prove anything to themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They may be extremely sensitive to any putdown (whether or not the other person
    really intended to judge them) and can react extremely aggressively. These folks
    can have a lot of mood swings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the guy in the bar who flips out at the smallest slight or the person
    who will never speak to you again after an insignificant fight. While we see this
    as difficult when we encounter it in another person, what’s *really* hard is the
    emotions that the other is experiencing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any small slight makes Chiron in Aries feel incredibly useless and will remind
    them of how deep down they will always lack a true self and a purpose. In order
    to *try* to make themselves feel better, they will snap, but it doesn’t fix the
    true issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason that the person will react this way is in an attempt to prove their
    uniqueness and worthiness to exist, but even if they can prove it through an interaction,
    it doesn’t convince them on the inside.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This wound can manifest in two completely separate ways, but the point is that
    the Chiron in Aries person is always trying to *prove* to themselves that they *are*
    worth it and *should* exist. Unfortunately, neither method convinces them that
    it’s true.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, because Aries can be so physical and extreme, this wound will sometimes
    manifest as extreme addictions to things (alcohol, drugs, working out, extreme
    sports, etc.).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Aries in Chiron person can be pretty hardcore when they’re trying to “get
    rid of” the bad feelings that come with the wound, but how exactly this happens
    will depend on the house and aspects to Chiron.

- en: Where Does the Wound Come From?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a Chiron in Aries wound, this means that in the past (whether in
    a past life or childhood) your individuality was stifled. During a series of interactions,
    you were taught that your individual beliefs, needs, wants, etc. were bad, and
    that it was wrong to have them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You basically learned that individuality is bad and that there’s something wrong
    with *your* beliefs specifically. You learned that you didn’t have the right to
    be yourself unapologetically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that this wound can often show up after someone has had a lot of *group*
    interactions. For example, maybe you were part of a big family and had to go along
    with all family decisions, or you were raised at a school with militant rules
    and you didn’t have a say over anything.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, this Chiron in Aries wound has to do with the parents. I find that
    some parents made the child feel as thought he/she had unique qualities that were *bad*,
    qualities that had to be stifled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This happened a lot in time periods when children had to be seen and not heard
    or when gender roles were strictly enforced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes Chiron in Aries comes from childhood, sometimes it shows up from a
    past life, and sometimes it’s a combination of both.

    Neither of these two reactions will make the Chiron in Aries individual feel good
    for the long haul or fix the struggle going on inside of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The difficulty with healing these wounds is that the Chiron in Aries person
    is very resilient and tends to avoid talking about pain. They would rather keep
    forging forward, but what Chiron in Aries needs to realize is that sometimes,
    backwards *is* forwards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step is for the Chiron in Aries person to confront the fact that he/she
    does not feel a sense of self. The person may feel that there’s something wrong
    with him, or that something about her is useless or destructive. This is *really*
    painful, but it has to be faced on to work through this wound.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They then need to realize that a false belief is the problem. They have some
    belief about themselves that *isn’t true, *because they absolutely do deserve
    to be here and are here for a reason.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chiron in Aries needs to make an impact on the world, but they have to find
    their unique purpose. It most likely will not be something that easily blends
    in with the crowd, but it will be extremely important to the growth of mankind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that while working on Chiron’s wounds, you may feel a good deal of suppressed
    anger, especially in a fire sign such as Aries. This is completely normal – do
    you best to express it in a non-destructive, healthy way, such as journaling,
    seeing a therapist, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chiron’s wounds will never completely heal, but they can be addressed and transmuted
    to create something wonderful. If you have the Chiron in Aries placement, you
    will learn that it is through your wounds (and the process of dealing with them)
    that you will find your unique purpose and start to feel like you exist for a
    specific reason.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chiron in Aries will often become quite the healer (whether physically, mentally,
    emotionally, or metaphorically) because they’re able to recognize when others
    feel a lack of self-worth, due to having experienced it themselves. They can be
    extremely kind and caring towards others once they can deal with their own pain
    instead of completely identifying with it.
