At the rising of the sun, on the twelfth day of the month, a piece of clean, white, fine cloth should be laid flat upon a table. An equal mixture of thyme, rosemary and freshly ground ginger root should be spread over it, evenly distributed, but not too heavy. The following invocation need be spoken aloud:

> ''Spirit of the Rising Sun
> 
> Enter this place
> 
> Allow thy face to shine brightly upon this offering
> 
> That thy grace may be invoked.
> 
> The Spirit of Fear hath taken up residence in mine humble home
> 
> And apprehension has settled in not to be easily shaken loose
> 
> Spirit of the Rising Sun hear my plea
> 
> Let these spirits no more bother me
> 
> Banish them to darkness and bid them take leave.
> 
> Spirit of the Rising Sun fill the empty corners
> 
> That lo, they may not loiter and hide
> 
> Sweep the rooms with thine mighty hand
> 
> Force them outside.
> 
> Spirit of the Rising Sun
> 
> I invoke your power
> 
> That these things for which I ask
> 
> Be done
> 
> So it was, so it is, so it shall ever be''.

When you have finished the invocation, carefully gather-up the cloth so as to not spill the mixture. Take the cloth full of mixture out of doors and shake it completely clean. The cloth should then be washed clean using soap and hot water.
