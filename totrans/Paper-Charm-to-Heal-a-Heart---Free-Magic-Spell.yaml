- en: White paper is fine, and lined works in a pinch, but feel free to use any colors
    that you associate with healing (e.g. blue or green), or love (e.g. red or pink).
    Alternatively, you can color on the paper or draw more symbols of love and healing
    on it before continuing on.

    herbs to use as a sachet for a boost of energies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hold the heart-charm in your hands and concentrate on the person. Focus on sending
    them feelings of love and healing. Fill the heart with positive energies, and
    the intent that your target will heal from their heartbreak and be able to feel
    all of the love that still surrounds them. Do this for as long as you feel is
    adequate for the charm to be charged.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can either seal the charm and gift it to your target, or burn it to release
    the feelings and energies to send to them; if you are not able to light fires
    or use candles, tear it up into small pieces and give them to your target or allow
    the wind to carry it away (bonus points if the wind happens to be blowing in the
    direction of where your target lives).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If burning the charm, you can set it in a fireproof container and drop a match
    onto it. Alternatively, you can set a corner of the charm into an open flame,
    then quickly put it into a fireproof container to finish burning. Ensure that
    the fireproof dish is also set on a fireproof surface that will not heat up. If
    you opted to use herbs in the charm, depending on how dry they are, the charm
    may simply smoulder and not completely catch on fire, and this is fine. Continue
    to burn it as much as needed before it is completely burned or singed, then dispose
    of the ashes. They can be released into the wind, kept in a vial or sachet and
    gifted to the target for further energies, or merely thrown out.

    that the herbs you chose are safe to be burned!
