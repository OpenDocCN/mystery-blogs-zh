    bellow your belly button and 2-3 inches inside your body, this is the very center
    of your body and this is where you gather energy from, all energy you gather to
    use come from here,before you try to use ki you must be able to feel out where
    your center is, close your eyes and concentrate, try to feel it deep inside your
    belly, try to see it, once you can feel it, it will feel like a warm tingly feeling
    deep inside your belly, now once you find it move on.

- en: This is probably,to me, the most important thing to get right first of all,
    to meditate you can be in either the indian style sitting position, where you
    sit and cross your legs with your left foot tucked into the back of your right
    knee and your right foot resting on top of your left knee, the sit that would
    see in a yoga video!, and place your right hand on your left calf and your left
    hand on your right calf and always keep your back upright.

    and your back upright and your hands on your legs. When meditating you should
    also concentrate on

- en: Meditation is quite easy, its just a total relaxed state of mind, no thoughts,
    no worries, just peace. To meditate is easy, just get into position, closing your
    eyes is optional, i find it easier with my eyes closed, ignore all outside noises
    and interuptions, then in your mind count backwards from 10, when you reach zero
    say in your mind "calm and relaxed", then count backwards from 9 when you reach
    zero say in your mind "calm and relexed", and so on, until you get to counting
    from zero to zero, then just sit there, your meditating right now and remeber
    to focus on your breathing.

    from zero to 2 saying in your mind "awakening more and more", then from zero to

- en: Visualisation is another very important thing to learn to do, if you have trouble
    with it already that is, visualisation is simply being able to picture things
    clearly in your mind, being able to feel those things, even taste them. You should
    practice this everday, it helps alot later on.

- en: To practice visualisation, the easiest thing to do is to start meditating, and
    during meditation, try and picture an apple in your mind, see every detail of
    that apple, now try to pick up the apple, feel the apple, as if it had been there
    the whole time, now take a bite out of it, taste it, feel less hungry when you
    swallow that bit of apple. Once you are able to do this, which means practice
    until you can it might take a week or even a few days depending on the person,

- en: Ki breathing is simple, just stand or sit, if standing, have your legs at shoulder
    lenght, hand by your side, if your sitting just sit like you would for meditation,
    now all you have to do is breathe in through your nose, visualise that your breathing
    in energy, let it fill your body, picture yourself and a large empty shell and
    each time you breathe in it fills the shell, when you breathe out, breathe out
    through your mouth and visualise it taking away the old energy, the bad stuff.
