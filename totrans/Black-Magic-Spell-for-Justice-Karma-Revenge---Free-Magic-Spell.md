**You will need the following items for this spell:**

Spell to Bring About Justice/Karma

Moon: Wayning
Days: 8 Days starting on Saturday at Midnight and ending on Sunday at Midnight
Color: Black Candle
Herbs: Dill, Anemone, Salt
Element: Earth
Goddess: Hecate
God: Vishnu
Solar System: Saturn

We are using a Black Candle to deal with setting hexes, bring about justice, and Karma, night magic, and truth. Saturday is in correspondence with Saturn, Hecate and lends power to justice, and karma. The wayning moon cycle addresses binding and crone magic. The number of days is eight because eight lends power to binding, justice, and karma. The time of midnight corresponds with revenge. The Goddess Hecate will be invoked to bring about a hex, karma, black and crone magic, and revenge. The God Vishnu deals directly with justice, and karma. The herbs being burned as incense for this spell correspond to hexes (dill), Justice (dill), karma (anemone), and the earth (salt). This is a black magic spell. Be careful in casting. If you want to be really nasty burn the candle for 11 days. The number 11 deals with hexes.

This isn't a spell, more like things you can use/associate to aid in a spell. I dont see a specific ritual here, either.

This would be a spell. You don't need chants or to call on specific deities and spiritual beings to cast a spell. This spell relies more on the energy you charge and date/number correspondences. Everything has energy you can utilize daily to bring magick into your life [choosing to wear an orange shirt when you need confidence for example] So this is a spell, it just relies on your energy more than items and deities assistance. [I cast one once where I charged a needle with energy and stabbed some gum and it worked within 24 hours, the person was caught and fined]
