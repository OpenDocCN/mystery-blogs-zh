    them and make it a bad thing.

    it bad. If they don’t like it or understand it then it’s bad or evil.

    not exist. They are more atheists than anything. LeVay used Satanism as a way
    to be sarcastic and was also controdicitary in his beliefs. A form of witchcraft
    was used in rituals, spells, etc.

    to follow their own path. It’s what you do with that path that dictates right
    from wrong.

    is always an opposite. You can’t have good without bad. You can’t have left without
    right, you can’t have dark without light.

    Everyone has good and bad in them. We all have negative thoughts at times, we
    want for things we can’t afford it have.

    it bad. But! Is bad always wrong? What defines bad or evil?

    are evil and wrong. Murder is one. I won’t list the rest because we all know the
    big ones.

    consider them wrong or evil but more of a negative expression. Something people
    can learn from and correct if they wanted to. I myself am known to let someone
    know when they drive bad and almost wreck me. Am I wrong for it, who knows but
    it was my way of letting someone know they were careless.

    I have practitioners who use inverted to remind them that there is bad and to
    embrace that fact to better themselves because the world is not all roses.

    having a third person in our marriage, practicing witchcraft, covered in tattoos.
    Instead of being angry we try to educate as best we can. Sometimes it’s just pointless
    and we walk away.

    happy, and what you use or practice helps you and others, then that’s all that
    matters. No one else can live your life, and you can’t live others.
