**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**WARNING: You have to be experienced in magic in order to do this. If you're a beginner you have to practice this alot of times to make it more powerful. 1\. Visualize your energy (or other's energy WARNING DANGEROUS) and imagine it forming around you to form a skeletal ribcage made out of any color of energy. Make it shine like color and make it look ghastly. 2.ADVANCED: Visualize energy coming around you and forming a ribcage along with a skull with glowing yellow or any color of eyes. Imagine it being strong and made out of metal energy. (You can also give it a weapon or just a fist or bladed fist.) 3\. After a month of practice go ahead and put flesh on the armor of energy and make it into a cool design. Mine is a hoodie with a face on it but the real face is under the hoodie. Also you can have a weapon as well even a unique one. My weapon is a chainsaw that can shoot out needles. TIPS: This power can be used to block and reflect spells can protect it from spiritual and physical attacks. Also it can be visisble or transparent but you have to put alot of belief and energy for it to be visible or even work. And if you keep practicing not only will this technique be more powerful but your energy will too.

We do not live in the Naruto Universe, would be cool to have these powers but we can't do this physically...so no. Maybe on the Astral Plane though? Unsure.
