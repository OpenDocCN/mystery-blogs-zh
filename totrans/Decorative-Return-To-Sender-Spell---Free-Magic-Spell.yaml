- en: For this protection spell I use a small round mirror that came from or fell
    off of a mirror work purse I own. These mirrors are usually very small and round,
    and can possibly be purchased at a craft store.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Place the small mirror on a table top or altar. Honestly mine is placed on a
    decorative marble cube figure I found, and right under my crystal ball and stand
    which as well is placed upon the cube stand. Both my mirror and shiva shell fit
    under my crystal ball.

- en: After placing the mirror, atop of it place your Shiva's eye shell. These shells
    are said to protect the owner from negativity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever you look upon this touch of protective altar decor, imagine the mirror
    reflecting negativity away from you and returning it to where it came. As another
    option you can decorate the space nearby to your mirror and shell with flowers
    of your choice. White flowers representing purity are nice as well as other protective
    flowers.
