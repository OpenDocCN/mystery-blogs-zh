- en: Mars is one of the best personal planets to learn about in astrology because
    it shows up so often in our personal lives. The planet of Mars rules our drive,
    temper, romantic attraction, sex life, and more.

- en: In Taurus, Mars is in *detriment* due to Taurus’ slow and steady nature. While
    this seems like a negative, there are ways that Taurus balances out Mars to create
    quite a bit of harmony.

    this post, I’ll be going over the characteristics of Mars in Taurus (natal) as
    well as the differences in masculine and feminine energy.

    things done, your temper and how you get angry, your career (where your drive
    and motivation is concerned), and your romantic/sex life, including the attraction
    phase. Here are the ways in which I find Mars in Taurus *natal* to manifest.

    it’s done. These natives are great at finishing tasks *as long as* they have sufficient
    motivation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they don’t want to do it (but are being told to or need to for some other
    reason), it can be impossible to get them to try. These natives are pretty lazy
    when they don’t feel like completing a task, but they have an enormous drive when
    they need to.

    their child to obey when he/she doesn’t want to.
  prefs: []

    security for themselves (money, home, love, etc.) and won’t stop until they get
    it, even if it takes years.

- en: Those with Mars in Taurus natal aren’t super adaptable once they’ve made up
    their mind. Taurus is a fixed sign, so these individuals won’t be easily convinced.
    They’re not quick to anger, but they simply won’t alter their plans for anyone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They typically have a strong temper only when they’ve been provoked for a prolonged
    period. Once this temper is let loose, these folks can hold a grudge for a while,
    especially if they feel they’ve been pushed too far. They don’t fly off the handle,
    but they can be extremely grumpy if they feel pressured.
  prefs: []

    resistance that’s impossible to get through, not blunt anger.

    give up easily; failure doesn’t get them down and they’ll keep pushing until they
    reach their goals. They’re not afraid to work for what they want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I sometimes find that these people end up working for others in pretty basic
    jobs (such as a mailman, baker, etc.) that have a strict routine, but this isn’t
    always the case. I also know some individuals with Mars in Taurus who work in
    the FBI, own their own businesses, etc.

- en: There isn’t any one career that is best for a Mars in Taurus natal. It will
    depend completely on the individual, but they’ll know when they’ve found the *right*
    one. A Mars in Taurus individual has the potential to bounce from career to career
    until they find the one that sticks. Once they discover it, they’re bound to stick
    with it forever and become very good at what they do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big theme for Mars in Taurus in terms of career is that they don’t give
    up easily. These people are stubborn and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve
    their goals, even if the dream feels impossible. It’s difficult to discourage
    them, so they usually end up being successful in whatever they choose.

    gourmet food are all things any Mars in Taurus will appreciate.

    and *what* *qualities* feminine energy are attracted to. Because this is such
    a big topic and since Mars is so important when it comes to attraction, I’ll cover
    this more in a few paragraphs.

    physical expressions (touch) as well as actions.

- en: They don’t often abstain from sex, at least in most placements. Some are slow
    to arousal while others are faster, but most people with Mars in Taurus enjoy
    seduction or foreplay of some type. Sex is typically a physical *and* emotional
    experience. They like to involve all of the senses and find a partner who will
    meet them on that level.

    expect to have every single one of these qualities. You will need to look at your
    own chart and see what fits based on the house and interactions to your Mars sign.

    Mars shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it does
    for someone with more feminine energy.*

    I recommend reading the description of each energy for Mars in Taurus (below)
    and choosing what resonates with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, in a man (or someone with masculine energy), Mars will show how the
    person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person is
    flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Mars in Taurus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a woman (or someone with feminine energy), *Mars will show what kind of qualities
    they are attracted to.* How this person will act depends on their Venus sign,
    but Mars dictates what types of energy they are drawn *towards* in a partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that these distinctions aren’t absolute. As a straight woman, I
    definitely show my Venus sign when I’m flirting, but sometimes my Mars will bleed
    through just a bit. I find these definitions to be about 80% accurate, but we’re
    always a unique combination of all of our signs.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A typical Mars in Taurus male is conventional and conservative. That doesn’t
    necessarily mean that his political views are conservative (as Mars doesn’t rule
    that), but he does tend to act more like an old-fashioned, traditional guy, whether
    or not he intends to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He likes to be in charge of things to make sure everything is okay. He is pretty
    sensitive, but it can be hidden deep down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He has a healthy respect for physical beauty, like any Taurus. When he’s in
    the flirting stage, he’s the type to dress up, take his date to a nice dinner
    in a fancy car, etc. He isn’t above a bit of romance, but he can also be pretty
    closed off from a partner. A man with Mars in Taurus definitely won’t fake love
    if he doesn’t feel it and it may take a bit for him to get there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At his best, this guy is classy and shows affection through physicality and
    actions. At his worst, he’s cold and uptight. He can easily ignore his partner
    for a *long* time if he’s angry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and where he’s from, whether this means his family and ancestry or where he grew
    up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He isn’t the loudest guy in the room by any means (unless he has a lot of Leo
    or Gemini) but he definitely has a physical presence that others notice before
    he even speaks. It’s usually this energy that attracts partners to him.
  prefs: []

    in love. If not, he can be cold, emotionally detached, and strictly physical.

    man who will care for her in some way, whether this means emotionally, physically,
    or financially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She often finds herself attracted to a “classic man” who has good looks, great
    taste, and a solid position in life. I picture this guy to be your typical roaring
    ’20s man. She will expect him to be loyal and dependable, but also needs someone
    she’s physically attracted to.
  prefs: []

    on clothing, cosmetics, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In bed, she is sensual and wants to please her partner, but she also likes to
    enjoy herself. Similar to the masculine energy with Mars in Taurus, the feminine
    energy enjoys a good bit of physicality and likes to employ all of the senses.

    shoes. It can be hard to see outside your own perspective, but this is the only
    way to evolve.

- en: At its best, Mars in Taurus is extremely spiritual, but because it’s a fixed,
    earthly sign, it’s easy to forget about the spiritual self. Don’t loose sight
    of the bigger picture or get bogged down in physical, day-to-day matters. Spiritual
    progress is important to growth with a Mars in Taurus placement and utilizing
    all of the senses in spiritual work can be very powerful.
