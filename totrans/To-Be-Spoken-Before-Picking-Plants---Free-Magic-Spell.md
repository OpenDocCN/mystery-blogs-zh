# To Be Spoken Before Picking Plants

An incantation to be recited before picking any plant used in magic. Adapted from a spell in the Greek Magical Papyri.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'To Be Spoken Before Picking Plants'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Recite this before sunrise on whatever day is associated with the particular herb (as an example: Friday for strawberries, Wednesday for cinquefoil, Saturn for potatoes, etc.):

"I am picking you, PN, with my five-fingered hand. I, NN, am bringing you home, so that you may work for me for a certain purpose. I adjure you by the undefiled name of the god DN, that if you pay no heed to me, and if I fail my operation, the earth which brought you forth will never be watered again as far as you are concerned. Mutabar nak barnakoka braeo menda laubraasse bendeo. Fulfil for me the perfect charm."

Where it says PN, speak the name of the plant. Where it reads NN, speak your own name, whether your birth name or a magical name. Where it reads DN, speak the name of the Greek deity whose sphere is associated with the plant (Aphrodite for Venusian plants, Hermes for Mercurial plants, Kronos for Saturnian plants, Zeus for Jovial plants, Ares for Martial plants, Apollo for Solar plants, and Artemis for Lunar plants).

**Additional Notes**:

*   It is best to face the east when plucking the plant, for this is where the sun rises from.
*   You must pluck the plant with your hands; using tools such as scissors will inhibit the spell.
*   Most plants are not under one single planet. If a plant you want is under more than one, use the name of the Greek deity whose sphere is most relevant to your intentions. For example, if it is under both Jupiter and Venus, use Aphrodite for love or Jupiter for wealth or fame.
