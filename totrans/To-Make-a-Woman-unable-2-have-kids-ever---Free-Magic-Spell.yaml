- en: Arouraboraa, magick is an extremely powerful friend (or ally, I suppose), but
    it can't go against the laws of our biology (unless you master Biokinesis, which
    can be extremely dangerous, especially in matters such as these. As with any other
    'kinesis', it'll take time to master. A lot of time for this one) . You can cast
    illusions and glamour to change eye color, but they're nothing more then glamours,
    illusions that trick the minds of others. You can cast a spell to make yourself
    less sexually appealing to others, but you probably won't be able to cause permanent
    infertility or sterilization without the use of more mundane methods such as chemicals.
    Also, if you do find a sterilization spell that works, don't act foolishly. These
    spells, if they are real, will take up a lot of energy, and will probably take
    even more energy to reverse (an amount of energy that you may not even have) and
    could result in dire consequences. I'm not trying to discourage you, I'm just
    telling you to be smart and check what your motives are

- en: This does not work. While some believe you can send enough negative energy towards
    a woman to have a miscarriage, this would take so much negative energy an individual
    would not be able to complete it. This spell specifically does not work because
    it would have to change your genetics. If a woman can have children, it would
    take more than a crystal and a chant to make the woman unable to have children.
    If you do not want children, there are many medical options available, and if
    they are too expensive, look into money spells.

    to someone innocent), but it probably won't make her infertile or sterile. Probably,
    that is...
