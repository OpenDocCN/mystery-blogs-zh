    by people who gardened and forested. You can grow herbs, you can also purchase
    many of these at a grocery store and claim you're interested in baking/cooking.
    As for items like frankincense and sandalwood, there are alternatives with similar
    magickal properties. [example, both frankincense and sandalwood has cleansing/protective
    qualities, but so does salt]
