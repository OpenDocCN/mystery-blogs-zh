- en: This spell uses symbolism, herbalism, candles and colour to achieve a purpose.
    The dragon is a symbol of wealth, wisdom, power and nobility, while ginseng is
    said to enhance virility. The supposition is that by putting all of them together
    you create the right vibration for attraction. If performing this the first time,
    then do it at the time of the New Moon.

    it is done place the representation of the dragon on a high shelf to represent
    status. Either keep the ginseng root beside your bed or use the powder as an incense
    additive until it is used up.

    words to bring the kind of man you want. Be careful though as you may get more
    than you bargained for. To attract a woman would require more feminine symbols
    such as a fish or a ladybird, and angelica root instead of ginseng.
