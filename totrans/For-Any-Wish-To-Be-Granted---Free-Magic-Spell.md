# For Any Wish To Be Granted

This is a Tuscan Witch's Charm. This is one of many spells I find from other sources so if you find anything wrong with the spell then that's a you thing. I put these spells on here to provide the information that I have learned, but in all honesty I do not perform anything that isn't mine. I also will not submit anything that is mine for it may not work and I wish no one harm. That being said, Please do read all comments to any of these spells that are on this website because it may give you more knowledge of the spell itself.

*   Three sacred wafer taken from communion.

 Take a goblet or cup full of hot water and three chairs in which three girls or women of the same age must sit. Each must take a pinch of salt and put it into the boiling water all together at once. The one whose salt dissolves first will be the most fortunate. Then each must take a little bag of red wooden stuff full of ashes that have been very finely sifted; let them sit with the cup in the middle all three clad in black with black veils, and each with a sacred wafer taken from communion. Each shall throw her ashes with the wafer into the boiling water and say:

I do not throw the ashes,

But I throw the wafer.

I do not throw the wafer,

But I throw the body and soul of [Name]

That he may no more have peace or happiness

Until I have obtained this my desire!

Then they must place their hands behind them, and not turn round to see the cup for a quarter of an hour; and when they at last look they will see whether the wafers are floating on the surface. I  this case thry will all three have obtained their wish, and if only one swims, then the one whose it is will be favoted; but if none float, no favor will be granted.
