- en: Ghosts from the subtle (spiritual) realm leave black energy on a majority of
    beings including humans that can create a variety of problems such as depression,
    unclear thinking or malfunction of an organ which lead to even further difficulties
    such as addiction, financial problems or chest pain respectively.
  prefs: []

- en: It is difficult to get rid of this black energy except through a generalised
    spiritual remedy such as spiritual practice or a more specific one like the salt
    water remedy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This spell, if done correctly, will ease the caster of lethargy, reduction of
    promptness, the inability to think, excessive thinking (particularly negative
    thinking); anger, stress, physical illness, and a lot more. A recommendation for
    anyone.

- en: The salt water remedy is a simple but powerful spiritual remedy to counteract
    the harmful unseen black energy and drain it out of our system. By doing so, we
    do not waste our spiritual practice in counteracting black energy. Instead it
    can be used to bring about our spiritual growth.

    pray specifically for destroying the black energy of the ghosts (demons, devils,
    negative energies, etc.) affecting you. Prayer is an important ingredient which

- en: This can work, but I take issue with a number of points in the spell. Negative
    energy can be due to malevolent spirits, but it could also be the result of daily
    life. Someone cuts you off in traffic, says something cruel, or you get angry,
    a little bit of negative energy sticks to you. Regular grounding, shielding, and
    cleansing will keep things in check. This does work, but you could also add it
    to a bath with a few herbs, soak in the tub, and do the same thing. You also do
    not need to pray to a deity if you do not work with one. Visualize the negative
    energy slipping off you into the water as you soak and if you wish to say a chant,
    you can easily state your intention ''cleansing waters take away, negative energy
    begone today.'' Heck, it doesn't even need to rhyme, just chant ''cleanse'' if
    you need to say something to focus. When you feel lighter, and the negative feelings
    are gone, get out of the tub, pull the plug, and the water will take the negative
    energy away.
