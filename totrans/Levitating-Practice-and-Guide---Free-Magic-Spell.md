# Levitating Practice and Guide

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This might or might not help you on levitating. Note that levitating takes years to conquer, this may or may not shorten that period of time.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A Strong Mind

*   Patience

*   Will Power

*   Relaxation

## Casting Instructions for 'Levitating Practice and Guide'

This is not the easiest thing to do, please note that. If it doesn't work, try and try and try, even harder, again. You'll get it in time.

For this to work, do my meditating technique first (under the Spell Casters Coven rituals). That will clear the mind, thus it shall be easier. Though, it is optional.

Stand or sit (for beginners, I suggest sitting) somewhere in a spacewise room. Sit cross legged and put your hands on your knees. Relax now.

Breathe in through the nose, and out through the mouth. Close your eyes and imagine you are in the sky, birds around you, chirping and singing. Now imagine you are floating over water, the seashores rising up against the sand and relaxing sound of water. Now imagine floating over a rock in a graceful field, animals lurking, yet not fighting, around you. Now imagine yourself back in the sky, and repeat this over and over again in your mind.

Now say the following chant:

''Skies and birds,
Above my head.
Worth it most,
Worth it least.
The gravity within me is now released.
Let me fly,
Into the sky.
Where I shall be relaxed and calm,
Put this gravity into my palm.
Never falling,
Never fearing.
Over the pier,
In which I fly,
Take this body,
Into the sky.''

Open your eyes. Are you floating? If not, try again. Repeat this chant as many times as you must to levitate.

Keep in mind though, do NOT fear flying. That will take away concentration and you will probably fall. If you'd like to prevent yourself from fear of heights, I suggest going to somewhere high and looking down. Then imagine yourself falling from that point without screaming, and you land gracefully without a scratch. I recommend the Empire State Building, but if you can't, maybe just a cliff or your roof, or an oversized rock.

Also, to get back down, close your eyes and imagine yourself floating down slowly in the sky, at the sea, and on the field. Make sure you float down SLOWLY!! You don't want to break your back. After thinking of that, say the following chant:

''Weightless and high,
I now take a sigh.
All the air within me,
Released upon my grasp.
Give me gravity,
Give me safety.
Floating down onto the ground,
Make me land without a pound.''

Now, for any confusing towards these chants, I will define them:

CHANT 1: Levitating

The first few lines explain you losing gravity.
The next few lines explain how you will and must act within the air.
The last few lines explain how you will not fall and how much you'd like to levitate.

CHANT 2: Landing

The first few lines explain how high you are.
The next few lines explain how you are releasing levitation.
The last few lines explain how gravity is transferred back to you.

Those are 2 chants you must know.

**Credit to all the ''Light as a feather, stiff as a board.'' chants for the idea.

I really want to levitate. It's weird because the only reason is it's the only constant power I have in dreams. No matter what, I'm always able to fly. It started out as simple levitation but I got more control over it and now I can fly. I wish I could do this in real life.

is this spell in dreams or in real life?

You cannot levitate with Real Magic, it is an illusion of stage magic.
