    is out of balance. It is a detailed analysis of our energetic make-up, that is
    right in front of our eyes, 24 hours a day. Yet, most people seem to fail to fully
    utilize this powerful tool for self-transformation, which seems to be so obvious
    yet not obvious at all.*'

    foods and drink a lot of water, we feel great. **When we eat a lot of highly processed
    food, our body is tired, slow, filled with toxins and mall nourished.** This appears
    to be a piece of general knowledge, that most people are aware of and would not
    find it surprising.

    and usually pretty visible results that are hard to ignore or misinterpret.

    work on the very same principle, yet very few people worry about what they consume
    on those levels**. We know we have to clean our physical body, after some time
    of use. But **we rarely think about cleansing our mental body or emotions.**

    unwashed body, filled with unhealthy food will go. Not a great place of course.
    What is worse, every energetic make-up will create a corresponding reaction of
    its surroundings, just like the world will react to the state of the physical
    body. These reactions will be more subtle and may be harder to detect. They can
    manifest as a variety of issues for example career problems, unhealthy relationships,
    lack of progress, unhealthy stagnation, just to name e a few.

- en: The first step should be a **thoughtful analysis of any patterns you can spot
    in your life**, situations you keep encountering again and again. After this,
    it is time for a constant awareness of what you consume on an emotional and mental
    level. Especially in modern days of the internet and social media, which are the
    energetic equivalent of a low-quality, processed fast food. Frequent relaxation,
    grounding practice, and spending time in nature is a great equivalent of shower
    and cleansing for the subtle bodies.
