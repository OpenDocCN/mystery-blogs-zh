    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [agate](https://wiccanow.com/agate/). Today I thought we’d focus
    on another beautiful crystal, namely celestine.

    a comfortable path in the woods or wandering through a meadow of wildflowers.
    The walk is easy and enjoyable and you feel totally relaxed. Breath deeply and
    note whatever scents are around you. Enjoy the fresh clear air as it fills your
    lungs. As you walk, notice the energy of the places around you. Are there any
    objects, sounds or scents that catch your attention? Perhaps you will meet a spirit
    guide? Keep following the path and walk along it easily until you reach a beautiful
    temple located in a peaceful clearing. Spend as much time there as you like. There
    are comfortable places to sit and there are other guides here as well. What do
    they say to you? What do you say to them? When you are ready, walk back along
    the path you came and when you reach the place you started, stop and open your
    eyes.
