**You will need the following items for this spell:**

 If you know who has put a crossed condition on you and you want to reverse the jinx onto them, burn a black candle on their name (putting their name on a paper beneath an overturned saucer under the candle) or carve their name on the candle. If you don't know the name of the person who did this trick to you, carve the words "**My Enemy**" on the candle. Any black candle will do, but if you use a black candle in the figure of the Devil, carve their name on it, and dress it with Cast Off Evil Oil, things will go harder with them. Burn the black candle on the toilet tank, a little bit each night, pinching it out between burnings. Burn it while the moon is growing smaller. Then, on the dark of the moon, the darkest night of the month, turn the burning black candle upside down and Extinguish it in the toilet bowl, saying;

> > **"Thus will you, [name of enemy] , meet your fate!"**

Throw the remaining black candle stub and wax into a crossroads -- or into the yard of the person who had put the roots on you or jinxed you.
