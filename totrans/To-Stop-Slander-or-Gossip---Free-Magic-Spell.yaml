    items for this spell:** At night time light a small fire in a cauldron or what
    ever you have available to contain the fire. Write on a piece of paper that is
    3 inches x 3 inches, the word "Rumors" and the rumors that are being spread about
    you. Do not write the names of those who are slandering you! You do not want to
    harm them and suffer the consequences with karma! Be thinking of these lies going
    away never to return as you draw an X with a dark marker across the paper. Toss
    the paper into the fire and repeat the following words 3 times.'

    a rumour to stop going around [factual or not] a stop gossip spell can help.
