- en: Cut a long piece of paper, then write your question in the paper with the pencil,
    and remember to include the question mark. Then fold the paper and throw the folded
    paper either in fire or room temperature water and when the paper burns or gets
    wet, concentrate in the feelings, the feelings will be the answers.

    and then visualize a question mark coming from the paper and going up to the roof
    or sky.

- en: The answer takes time to come. If it's a bad feeling, then it's the bad news,
    if it's a good feeling, then it is the good news. Remember, ask only a yes or
    no question, and don't ask about big things like weather or about a car crash
    or about something bad happening to you.
