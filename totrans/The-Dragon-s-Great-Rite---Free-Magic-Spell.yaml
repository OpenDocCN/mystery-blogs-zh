    a Dragon who has taken you under your wing as an active being. This is not a beginner''s
    process, and is not well suited to calling on archetypal forms as they are passive
    energy and not active beings.'

- en: This rite is at once simple, but also advanced. In that there are requirements
    best met before submitting yourself to such an intense (potentially profound)
    experience. First is acknowledgement of yourself as a being of energy and light.
    Second is recognizing your Dragon guide/co-mage as the same. An entity of light
    and energy, an ascended master of the energies meant to be balanced and unified
    within the Self. One capable of offering the same balance and sense of Whole-ness
    to yourself to stimulate healing, and internal unity. And, finally, the agreement
    of your guide that you are in a position to benefit from the experience in a healthy
    way. Ultimately it will be the choice of your co-magician/guide as to whether
    such a rite will occur.

    at an altar, offerings within a sacred space, or while in centered meditation.
    As you feel the being's presence express your desire to share in each-other's
    energies through union. Speak formally or casually as you wish, or as your relationship
    dictates. By the time you have enough comfort to ask for this, you will know your
    Draconic partner well enough to know how to go about it. And, if your partner
    consents, it will be made known in no uncertain terms.

    Enough space to lie comfortably. Natural, low light (or safe candle light). Light
    lavender, dragon's blood, or another favorite incense (I have a soft spot for
    'forest rain'). Ring a bell, Tingsha, singing bowl or other source of a bright lingering
    ring to clear the air and open the space to yourself and your partner. Kneel or
    bow in greeting, and invite your partner within.

    and experienced, and in trust with the bond between yourself and your Dragon compatriot
