    Go and find your Enemies and give this paper to. Then Wrath shall befall them
    or place it under their bed and until it is removed or burned. Then they will
    suffer... so pretty much no one is going to know to burn it. Therefore, take heed
    to this warning. I suggest that you let them take it, then take it back and burn
    it after all is done and thy desire hath been met.
