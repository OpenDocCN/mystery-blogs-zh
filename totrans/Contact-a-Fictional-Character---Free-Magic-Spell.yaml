    of your character or look at the picture of the character. Focus all your energy
    onto them. Think of them. Then write on the paper a question. Listen for the character's
    response.

    character that you like. Try to mentally talk to the character. If this doesn't
    work you can also try meditation or try again later. Like most things, it doesn't
    always happen on the first try.

    another universe and they can't physically appear.

    for guidance, or create a servitor to advise you as they would, but this is your
    subconscious, not the actual character.
