- en: This ritual calls upon the powers of Sahia to manifest destruction through the
    element of water. This ritual will kill by means of drowning, flood or tsunami.
    Sahia now knows that after thousands have died and you still summon more; she
    will now become eager for more deaths.

- en: The altar should face north. Place the altar bowl on the center of the altar.
    Place the yellow candle behind the altar bowl. The red candle goes in front of
    the altar bowl. Place the blue candle to the left and the green candle on the
    right side of the altar bowl. Place the athame on the right side of the altar.
    Place the white candles at the quarters around the ritual circle. Have a stool
    handy. Now it is time to step into the circle.

- en: Stand tall and hold the athame high. Visualize the energy of the cosmos striking
    the athame and going into your body, charging you up. Fill yourself with this
    energy and hold it inside yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lower your arm so that the athame is pointing straight. Speak the line of incantation
    and draw in the energy of the element in that direction and light the candle on
    the altar in that same direction to the altar bowl. Turn clockwise to the next
    direction, do the same thing until you are back facing north.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sit on the stool; close your eyes and just quiet your mind and allow your thoughts
    to go without paying attention to any one of them. Open your eyes and make the
    request for protection and once again quiet your mind and allow yourself to feel
    the presence of your guides and protectors.

- en: Stand and face the corresponding walls when you call the seals. Hold the athame
    over your chest with your right hand. The blade should be pointing up. Once you
    feel their presence, it is time to light the candles around the circle, starting
    with the north going east, south and west.

- en: Write Sahia on the last offering and seal it with the wax of the right candle
    on your altar. Open your heart and soul to this demon and be bound to her until
    you complete or fail this ritual. You are allowed to command this demon to your
    hearts content, but beware, once shes either resurrected or you release her in
    failure, she will quickly kill you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you shall open your heart to receive her into your soul and now it is time
    to work with her to destroy as much as possible through the second element. Allow
    the energy left over return to their sources. In the reverse manner with the athame,
    you now return the energy you have left over and put out the candles in the reverse
    order in which they were lit.

- en: Burn the Azahrans Awakening. Now that the curse is done, you can now leave the
    magic circle. Wait until the following morning to clean up the materials and put
    away the tools. Do not burn the last offering, until you resurrect Sahia and set
    her free upon the world.

    until none are left. Rage the oceans into a frenzy of froth and send the waves
    to wash the land clean of life.  Be murderous and be greedy for the souls of the
    slain, because all are yours. Death shall come and it shall manifest through you
    as the raging ocean.
