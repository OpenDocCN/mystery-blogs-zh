This is my first spell so don't be mean if it doesn't work. You can change the color of your tail by removing the nail polish and applying new color.

3\. When it's dark outside, go out in your bathing suit, and dump the bucket on top of your head. Then, recite,
''Merfolk around all of the world, grant a wish to me. Let me be a mermaid with a (color of nail polish) tail and a scaley top to match, and a power that matches my personality. Without nail polish on my finger and toe nails in water, I won't have a tail. Let this spell prevail and when I have nail polish in my finger and toe nails water shall transform me. To the mermaid me. Merfolk all around the world, he my plea, grant this wish to me. So mote it be!''

You cannot become a mermaid.

I am stating facts in an attempt to help people who are new not get fooled. You can work with mermaids, you cannot physically become one. It is simply a fact of Real Magic on the physical plane. It does not defy nature. Physical transformation is not naturally possible and therefore not Magically possible.
