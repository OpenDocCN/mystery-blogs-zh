    beginning of magick. It does not belong to any ''path'' or ''side'' (white, dark,
    elemental, etc.).

- en: Change into silver robes (wear no shoes). Go outside and cast a circle with
    your friends at the large patch of dirt. Place the candles in a triangle pattern
    at the center. Divide the circle into three parts (mentally) and place one of
    the herbs at the outer areas where the circle is divided (there should be a separate
    herb at each area (which should be just inside the circle))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each person should each hold two lit matches and stand in a separate part of
    the circle (within the divided sections). The person from each section should
    take the match in their right hand and light the herbs to their right on fire
    then place the matches on top of the herbs when they light.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The person from each section should then take the match in their left hand (do
    not switch the match to your right hand) and light the candle in your section
    (the candle should be at the center in between the areas where the lines created
    by the herbs are) and then place the match in in front of the candle with the
    burnt end facing the left

- en: i'm on the fence, it sounds plausible, but for one thing Samhain is a holiday,
    yet it says ''dried'' so i assume it's an incense blend of some sort and it's
    not listed. secondly, stressing it needs to be in the left hand, whenever i find
    a spell that tells you to hold something it's in your power/dominant hand, so
    unless they provide a reason, i don't see why it's a big deal. third, what's the
    purpose if this spell? the power of three? are you calling on the triple goddess
    to be in your circle? are you calling on karma to turn on someone? are you trying
    to conjure energy to become more powerful? it gives me the same vibes from The
    Craft [hopefully you know that movie] where there's truth but it's tweaked just
    enough to be fantasy. so, overall, i would edited it to work for you, because
    as is, i don't think it does much.
