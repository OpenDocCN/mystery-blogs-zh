- en: I doubt this works as intended. If this is meant to close a physical portal,
    it will not, you cannot open physical portals. If this is meant to close a spiritual
    portal, it might help some end meditations, but you do not need a physical door.
    If this is to reverse a spell, again, no need for the physical door. You also
    need to cleanse the items used if possible, and if not, you need to do some form
    of cleansing around the situation. Say you cast on a person, you would need to
    stop the energy from reaching them and saying ''my bad'' does not stop the energy
    already on route to them. If you choose to end a spell with ''amen'' you can,
    but that is a Christian concept and not necessary unless it resonates with you.
