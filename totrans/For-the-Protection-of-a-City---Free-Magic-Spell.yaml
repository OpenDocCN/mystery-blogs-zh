- en: To begin with, you must remain pure for eight days, starting from sunrise on
    the first day to sunrise on the eighth. During this time, you must eat only unleavened
    bread and drink only water. You must neither have sexual intercourse nor masturbate.
    You must steal nothing, slander no-one, and injure no-one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the eighth day, take a large amount of money and walk through your town or
    city. When you meet a homeless man or woman, give them some money - enough for
    a large meal. Do not tell them your name, nor an alias, nor where you live. When
    you are done, leave them and silently pray for their wellbeing; I will not tell
    you what to pray.

    people before sunset. When this is done, return home.

    ignite it. When this is done, say "Beneath thy holy shield we all are safe, O
    Adonai, O Yeshua Meshiach, against all tempests and all enemies. No fire, no weapon,
    no plague shall touch us. We are under thy protection, forever and ever. Amen."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    nor shall any enemy raze it, nor shall dread storms bring it to ruin.

    not possibly give an estimation.

- en: Be charitable, but give only to those who need it. Many lie in wait, eager to
    take your money, while many others are in genuine need. Do not give to those who
    do not need it, lest you cause them to sin. Be wise and observant, yet also be
    generous. Quoth the Didache, "Let your alms sweat in your hands, until you have
    discerned to whom you will give."
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is exceptionally important that you tell no-one you are performing this spell.
    Do not tell your friends, family members, fellow practitioners of magic, nor anyone
    else. You must also keep your giving a secret, telling no-one that you gave or
    plan to give money. "But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand
    know what your right hand is doing, that your charitable deed may be in secret;
    and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly." (Matthew 6:3-4)
