 ## Casting Instructions for 'Prayer for Emotional Healing'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** "When insecurity hits me like a raging wind
Be with me, Father Satan
When doubt strikes me like lightning
Remind me of truth
When fear over powers me
Hold me in your wing, Great Dragon
If pain grabs me like a claw
Heal me, with your mighty power
When depression fills me as water in a well
Shower my soul with joy, Beautiful Peacock Angel
Anxiety creeps through my mind, taking over my thoughts
Place me on solid ground
When I feel I am not good enough,
Make my spirit shine as a star, Wise Serpent
And if I feel that it is too hard to go on
Give me strength"
