    on your mind. Wrap the stone up in a tight ball and visualize yourself  draining
    your negative jo jo into the ball, now seal it with black wax. It takes a second
    because you want an actual ball of wax. When you get the ball of wax, freeze it.
    For the next thirty days just get it out of the freezer when your upset and hold
    it in your hand to "freeze your problems" and drain the unwanted feelings into
    the stone. After a months use you should make a new one and bury the old in the
    yard somewhere it can''t be disturbed.**'

    feelings and you should at some point try to work through them or they will one
    day boil over.

    I'm still living with my parents and they don't let me use candles.

    on a piece of paper and freeze that
