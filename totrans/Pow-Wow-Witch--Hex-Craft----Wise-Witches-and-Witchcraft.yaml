- en: Pow-Wow Witchcraft, also called Hex Craft, has its beginning with the Pennsylvania
    Dutch. This practice focuses nearly wholly on healing and other connected human
    needs like protection. They also use true seeing and a little luck magic for good
    measure.

- en: The Pennsylvania Dutch established settlements in the eighteenth century. Historians
    believe, however, that this magical tradition has roots reaching back to much
    earlier practices in Germany. Generally speaking everyone in a community knew
    who the Hex Masters were. There wasn’t something discussed in “polite” company
    because there were negative attitudes toward folk magic. The Pow-Wow Witch learned
    his or her art from their family or elders through oral tradition.

    These are remnants from Pow-Wow magic meant to protect the home, often from illness.
    Most villages had a healer who used roots and herbs in remedies. While the recipes
    for health had strong folk magic links, there was also a lot of knowledge possessed
    by these people. Even modern medicine has found many recommended herbs successful.

    Pow Wow magic among the Mennonites and Amish communities. There were also quiet
    Pow Wow practices in the Lutheran Church. This link to Christianity, among others,
    resulted in incantation and charms fashioned from Bible verses similar to [**Hoo

    of spells. These spells focused on keeping malevolent spirits away, caring for
    farm animals and healing. Another interesting practice in Pow-Wow is that of finding
    water.

    carrying a Y shaped branch. The prevalent tree types chosen for dowsing are Willow
    and Hazel. If the rod dipped or twitched, that’s where they would dig in hopes
    of creating a well. While this may sound like a silly methodology, there was enough
    interest in water witching that the US Geology Department did studies on it in
    the early 1900s.

    She saw a person in the holistic sense. Treating disease and sickness needed not
    just the magical element but also physical and emotional. This permeates the entire
    Hex Craft culture.

    you to be ready to learn a lesson in patience. You will receive one charm at a
    time and commit it to memory. The Hex Witch also expects that you will respect
    her tradition and keep her teachings private, remembering from whom they came.

    From their perspective, God is helpful, and that is an important example to follow.
    Perhaps this is why Hex Witchery focused so much on healing. That ability improved

- en: Practitioners of Pow-Wow do feel that one is called to this path, particularly
    those who have natural healing aptitudes. The duty of the Pow Wow’s does not stop
    conveniently when the sun goes down. Rather this healer is “on call” as needed.
    That need can become overwhelming, meaning the Pow-Wow Witch must carefully mete
    out her energy.

    Some might be excellent at relieving pain, while others ease matters of the heart.
    Pow-Wow Witches might find they are best at protection or banishing too. This
    is where your ability to self-assess becomes essential. Only you can find your
    best strengths (as well as flaws). You are not the lone person with gifts on an
    island of illness. PowWow has community ties. The successful PowWow group knows
    the abilities of each person and how to utilize them, producing a greater good,
    by the will of God. For modern Wiccans and Witches, the reliance on the Bible
    can be a huge obstacle if they find this craft interesting. Without the Bible,
    there is no PowWow framework. Keeping with tradition matters greatly to the PowWow
    community.
