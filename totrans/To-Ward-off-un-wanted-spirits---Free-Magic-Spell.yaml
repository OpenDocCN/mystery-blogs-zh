- en: 'Start off by of course purifying yourself. Everyone has their own way of purifying
    themselves but I would suggest creating a source of light around you with energy.
    This is because hostile spirits will try their best to stop you from doing your
    duty. So, after you are purified and your mind is clear on the task at hand, burn
    the bundle of sage. Wave the bundle of sage gently at each corner of the effected
    area, allow the smoke to creep in and drive out the spirits. Once all the corners
    have been purified, you may extinguish the bundle of sage. Next, go to each corner
    (which has been sagged) and sprinkle a pinch of salt. Now, take your saucer(s)
    and pour equal amounts of salt and water inside. Place the saucer/bowl under neath
    a bed, chair, couch, or stand (underneath something that is in use a lot), this
    works as a one-way portal to keep hostile spirits at bay and keeps your space
    clean. Last! Light the white candle and set in an area where it won''t catch anything
    on fire. Concentrate on the flame and cast this spell:'

    into the air at a certain amount of time, once that is done you may remove them
    as well (that can take weeks) but your space is just clean. Letting the water
    evaporate is more of an insurance policy.
