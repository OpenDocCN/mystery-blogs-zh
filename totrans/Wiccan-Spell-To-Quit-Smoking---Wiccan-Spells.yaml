    and psychological components. Nicotine, the primary addictive substance in cigarettes,
    activates the brain’s reward system, causing the release of neurotransmitters
    like dopamine and creating a pleasurable sensation. Over time, the brain becomes
    dependent on nicotine to maintain this sense of pleasure, leading to addiction.
    Additionally, individuals may form psychological associations with smoking, such
    as using cigarettes as a coping mechanism or as part of their daily routine.
