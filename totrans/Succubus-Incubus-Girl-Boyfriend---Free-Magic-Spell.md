 ## Casting Instructions for 'Succubus/Incubus Girl/Boyfriend'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Incense optional

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   White Candle optional

*   Incense optional

 Get in your quiet private room lock the door, light your candle and burn your incense. Lay on your back on the bed with your face towards the ceiling. See that your body is placed comfortably on the mattress.

Spread your legs apart approximately 45 degrees from each other.Close your eyelids and take a deep breath count to three and exhale. State your intentions quietly in your mind.

Now start imagining your succubus the way you want to see her in your minds eye. Imagine her lying on top of you naked caressing your body. Feel her soft touch on your body and genitals. Listen to her voice as she tells you how much she loves you. If you are calling an incubus, do the same but with him in mind.

Go over this mental image for about 5 minutes and do not get tempted to touch yourself. If in the 5 minutes time you start feeling a sort of presence or tingle you dont normally feel over your body or it might also be a feeling of joy and love that surrounds you. It means you have created you first connection.

Once the 5 minutes are out, simply lay there and focus on your breathing for 10 minutes. Gently and slowly regain normal consciousness and come back to the room. Whether it worked or not, try practicing this daily if possible and very soon your experiences will get more intense.

Yes this will work.

How did it happen for you

Will the incubus try to rape me if I don't want to start sexual intercourse yet and I want to get to know them first

it's a sexual demon, it feeds off the energy produced during sex. don't summon one if you're not wanting sex. you can befriend them and make a deal with them [as with all demons] but it's ridiculous to assume you can summon a demon [of any kind] claiming you will make an exchange with them, only for hem to show up and go ''can we go to the movies first?'' the vast majority will attack you. if you don't know what you're doing, they will attack you. demons aren't pure evil, but they will get what they want by any means. do not summon an incubus if you're not prepared to make the exchange. [and they aren't physically beings so don't expect a physical manifestation to attack you, but you can be attacked]

Will I still be a virgin after this

they are astral beings, so you wouldn't have physically changed, and virginity isn't a thing per sey, it's more a religious or cultural construct and belief. there's no actual virginity test and anything people claim to be accurate tests [like checking the hymen] it doesn't actually prove anything. so if you've never had physical sexual intercourse and identify as a virgin, having sex with a demon isn't technically a physical act so technically you never had sex, but if your definition of virginity includes never having sex, and you consider sex with a spiritual being sex, then by your definition you would no longer be a virgin [but on the physical you never had sex, and again, virginity isn't really a thing, so reflect on your views and make your own mind up]

Will they be able to teach me a few things I'd like to know about astral arts etc?

Yeah they can and if you work with an sexual demon then always cleansence your chakras

I am 14 will I become pregnant

You won't become pregnant from a succubus/incubus. They are spiritual beings, you are physical, you can't breed. [similar to a cat and an elephant, they're different species so they can't breed]

I just had sex at 14

How does it feel, I would like to know, because I keep on trying but it doesn't work

How does it feel, I would like to know, because I keep on trying but it doesn't work

can I do this with red or purple candles?

And how do I fend my self

I've been trying a lot of these and they won't work, I need help

How do i know if it worked?

A sexual demon will not become your partner. You can use this spell to conjure them and you can make a contract with them, but it is not a romantic relationship. They will claim to be whatever you want them to be in exchange for the energy they feed off of. Research succubus/incubus before casting so you know how to protect/defend yourself as well as how to banish them if things go wrong.
