- en: The formation of incense smoke patterns can be explained by scientific principles
    such as diffusion, convection, and air currents. When incense is lit, it releases
    tiny particles into the air, known as smoke. As the hot air rises, it creates
    a convection current, causing the smoke to rise along with it. This movement of
    air and smoke creates intricate patterns as the smoke interacts with the surrounding
