    on the physical features it has. For example, does it have fur, scales, wings,
    legs, or multiple heads? Connect mentally with the animal once you are focused
    enough. To be kind, ask the animal for permission to inhabit it's body. Negotiate
    wether you, in the animal's body will be where the animal is or where you are.
    If you have permission, leave the animal thank it and leave a mental doorstopper
    to keep the door to that animal wedged open. Next, recite this incantation ''Mutatio
    to quidam animal in animus que corpus corporis.'' Now go back in through the mental
    door and inhabit the body of the animal.

- en: Very amusing, that is a fur suit. Of course you can dress up as an animal and
    play pretend, but that is not what this spell is claiming. This spell claims you
    can physically transform which you cannot. Real Magic is a natural energy that
    brings natural change. Humans by nature cannot transform from human to giraffe,
    or whatever creature you wish to be. You can dress as the animal and call on their
    energy in a ritual, work with animal spirits/totems, or call on astral werewolves
    to assist you in your path, but physically transform you cannot.
