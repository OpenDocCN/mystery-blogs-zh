 Have the cards shuffled and in a deck with your hand on them. Clear your mind and focus on the question about your past life. Shuffle the deck once more as the question remains on your mind.

Feel the energies of the cards and pick the one with the most energy. Feel the energy of that card. What is it telling you? Think for a moment. Can you retrieve a memory?
