    if days go by - or weeks - and nothing happens? What happens if you think your
    spell failed to work? Do you recast it? Do you continue waiting? What should you
    do?
  prefs: []

- en: I think that you should continue waiting and *not* recast the spell. Now, this
    belief is going to differ from person to person and faith to faith. Let me explain
    why I believe you do not need to recast your spell.

- en: I believe that, if you did not set adequate parameters for the energy you cast
    out during your magickal working, **the spell will take its time and manifest
    when it feels like it**. Now, this could mean that it takes months for the spell
    to work the way you want it to. It could be that you did the spell this way on
    purpose. I know for some of my magickal work, when I have asked for the assistance
    of the Gods, I left it in Their hands to decide when the time was right for me
    to receive what I wanted. If this is the case, be patient and know that They might
    know better than you. If you did not do your spell this way, maybe you just forgot
    to set parameters for the energy in your spell. That happens, and it is okay.
    But still, be patient and wait it out for at least six months before you consider
    recasting. And I will tell you why in a minute.

- en: This goes along with the example of my magickal work when I ask the Gods for
    their assistance. Maybe I am being greedy. Maybe the Goddess that I am giving
    an offering to in exchange for their help sees a better opportunity for me. Or
    - and this does happen - They do not want to help, so the spell takes longer or
    does not happen at all. Depending on your beliefs, this could be a valid reason
    why your spell is taking longer than you want to manifest. If you asked for help,
    consider that.

- en: Again, this goes back to parameters and how you cast your spell. If you do not
    focus properly or you do not give the energy any direction or instruction, **your
    spell will fail**. Maybe you were trying to make a honey jar but instead of sugar,
    you accidentally used salt. Sugar is a key ingredient in any sweetening jar spell,
    so using salt instead will either not work or have the wrong effect. Consider
    this spell, in this case, a learning experience. Maybe you need to learn more
    about correspondences and ingredients before trying again.

- en: This might be harder to pin down, but if your heart or your subconscious does
    not *really* want the thing you are asking for, your subconscious might redirect
    the energy unbeknownst to your conscious mind. Your spell will not work in this
    case because the energy you were directing received conflicting intentions and,
    therefore, **did not know what to do**.

- en: Now, I know some things *appear* impossible but, in reality, are well within
    the laws of physics or our physical world. However, if you begin to ask to breathe
    underwater, throw fireballs, or - less conspicuously - literally change the color
    of your eyes, you will be sorely disappointed. **Magick will not allow you to
    go above the laws of physics**, no matter how much you want to.

    answer that question, keep these points in mind.
