Powerful way to make someone lust for you

*   1 White Candle

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 White Candle

*   1 Black Candle

*   1 Red Candle

*   Pen and Paper

 Prepare all ingredients, then sit in a quiet room where you can do the deed. 

Write the name of your "victim" on a piece of paper. Then while strongly focusing on them, deduct the letters that repeat themselves from his/her name, it will look something like this:

Jacob Jones = **J**acob J**o**nes = Jacbones (you can deduct letters as you see fit to make the mantra more pronounceable)

Then, merge all letters into one meaningful symbol, as you are doing all of this you are keepeng them on your mind all the time.

Then draw closed hexagram and put candles at the points of the upper triangle when looking from your perspective, red in the middle black on the right side and white on the left side. Put the paper with the sigil in the middle. Sit meditate, imagine making love with him/her. Imagine it all from your first person, the touch the sounds, words, the more details, the better.

Whilst doing so, imagine energy going from yourself into the sigil and recite the mantra you made from their name.

Repeat the process untill your desire is fulfiled.

Plausible. I would draw the sigil you created from their name onto a photo of them, carve it into the red candle, and/or anoint the candles with love oils and herbs. A chant would add more energy to the spell. As outlined, it does work, a few tweaks would improve the spell.
