## Is Today Your Birthday?

A full moon on your birthday means you will have to deal with people who too often put emotion before common sense. You tend to do that yourself at times but this year it will be you who must be logical and pragmatic. And you’ll do it very well.

### AQUARIUS

The full moon warns that you need to be careful when dealing with financial matters, especially those that involve other people. Each move you make must be okayed with your partners and associates. If you act on your own they won’t be happy.

### PISCES

With so much cosmic activity in your sign at the moment you honestly feel you can do anything and everything. However, today’s full moon could bring you down to earth a bit if you stretch your resources too far. Don’t forget you’re human Pisces!

### ARIES

If you lose interest in something that previously was important to you that’s okay. The planets indicate that it may be time to rethink your priorities, especially on the work front where you seem to have fallen into a bit of a rut. Change is good.

### TAURUS

Time will be limited today, so decide what two or three tasks are of most importance to you and focus on those to the exclusion of everything else. You can catch up with the rest over the weekend or early next week – if you can be bothered.

### GEMINI

Today’s full moon warns this is not a good time to commit yourself to anything risky. Be especially wary of people who promise quick financial returns – most likely they will try to sign you up to something that benefits them more than it does you.

### CANCER

You must expect upheavals of one sort or another over the next 24 hours. Today’s full moon will affect others more than it affects you but one thing it will do is focus attention on your weaknesses and challenge you to turn them into strengths.

### LEO

A friend may ask you to help them out today and, of course, you will do what you can. But don’t do too much. Let them know right from the start that this is a one-off event – you cannot afford to bail them out each and every time.

### VIRGO

The more others expect you to fit in with their plans the more you will fight against it, and rightly so. Go your own way, do your own thing and don’t worry if some people complain that you are not a team player. It’s okay to be an individual.

### LIBRA

You may have to flatter someone who does not deserve it but that’s okay. The more you go out of your way to be nice to people today the more cosmic points you will chalk up for later when you need others to help you – and they will.

### SCORPIO

You should know by now that you won’t change other people’s attitudes or beliefs by coming on too strong – it just makes them dig in their heels even more. Today’s full moon urges you to be patient, not just with others but with yourself as well.

### SAGITTARIUS

You don’t lack for confidence but that may not always be such a good thing. Today’s full moon warns you need to be a little less of a know-it-all and a little more willing to listen to other people. Your future success could depend on it.

### CAPRICORN

There are some battles that can never be won and you need to be aware of that fact today or you could mistakenly take on someone who is way too powerful for you and end up looking silly. The full moon’s message is to know your limits.
