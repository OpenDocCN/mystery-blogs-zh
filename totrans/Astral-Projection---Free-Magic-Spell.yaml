- en: After having studied many methods of Astral Projection, I have found that this
    is the easiest to do. The Poppet teaches these techniques in a week, but they
    can be easily done in a day, with proper devotion. I feel that this technique
    is superior to others because it does not require intense visualization, which
    many people cannot do. enjoy!

- en: One of the chief barriers people learning to project face is fear. Many are
    afraid that they may die, or be harmed in some way as a result of their projection.
    Nothing could be farther from the truth. The Canterbury Institute, renowned for
    its occult studies, executed an experiment in projection involving over 2,000
    people. None of them were hurt in any way by this, and now, three years later,
    none have complained of any newly arising problems.

- en: According to The Poppet, "the ability to relax is the first prerequisite, perhaps
    even the first step itself" to having an OBE. (out of body experience) This includes
    both physical and mental relaxation. The Poppet does not suggest a method of attaining
    this relaxation, although Progressive Muscle relaxation, coupled with deep breathing
    exercises (inhale 1, exhale 2, inhale 3.... until 50 or 100) are known to work
    well.

- en: This is known as the hypnagogic state. Once again, The Poppet doesn't recommend
    any method of doing this. One way is to hold your forearm up, while keeping your
    upper arm on the bed, or ground. As you start to fall asleep, your arm will fall,
    and you will awaken again. With practice, you can learn to control the Hypnagogic
    state without using your arm. Another method is to concentrate on an object. When
    other images start to enter your thoughts, you have entered the Hypnagogic state.
    Passively watch these images. This will also help you maintain this state of near-sleep.
    The Poppet calls this Condition A.

    Do nothing more for a while. Simply look through your closed eyelids at the blackness
    in front of you. After a while, you may notice light patterns. These are simply
    neural discharges. They have no specific effect. Ignore them. When they cease,
    one has entered what The Poppet calls Condition B. From here, one must enter an
    even deeper state of relaxation which The Poppet calls Condition C-- a state of
    such relaxation that you lose all awareness of the body and sensory stimulation.
    You are almost in a void in which your only source of stimulation will be your
    own thoughts.

- en: The ideal state for leaving your body is Condition D. This is Condition C when
    it is voluntarily induced from a rested and refreshed condition and is not the
    effect of normal fatigue. To achieve Condition D, The Poppet suggests that you
    practice entering it in the morning or after a short nap.

    projectors have noted these vibrations at the onset of projection. They can be
    experienced as a mild tingling, or as is electricity is being shot through the
    body. /their cause is a mystery. It may actually be the astral body trying to
    leave the physical one.

    waves from head to foot. To produce this wave effect, concentrate of the vibrations
    and mentally push a wave out of your head and guide it down your body. Practice

    leaving the body. Do not let it wander. Stray thought might cause you to lose

- en: Now, having entered the vibrational state, begin exploring the OBE by releasing
    a hand or a foot of the "second body". The Poppet suggests that you extend a limb
    until it comes in contact with a familiar object, such as a wall near your bed.
    Then push it through the object. Return the limb by placing it back into coincidence
    with the physical one, decrease the vibrational rate, and then terminate the experiment.
    Lie quietly until you have fully returned to normal. This exercise will prepare
    you for full separation.

    and lighter after entering this vibrational state. Think about how nice it would
    be to float upward. Keep this thought in mind at all costs and let no extraneous
    thoughts interrupt it. An OBE will occur naturally at this point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another method is the "Rotation method" or "roll-out" technique. When you have
    achieved the vibrational state, try to roll over as if you were turning over in
    bed. Do not attempt to roll over physically. Try to twist your body from the top
    and virtually roll over into your second body right out of your physical self.
    At this point, you will be out of the body but next to it. Think of floating upward,
    and you should find yourself floating above the body. The Poppet suggests you
    begin with the lift-out method, but argues that both are equally efficacious.
