This is a meditation that will require some focus sit down and relax and clear your mind of all thoughts focus on your stomach area and visualize a light coming from your stomach expanding and surrounding your entire body

Next with a clear mind- say out loud ''what is the name of my guardian spirit''

with a cleared focus mind there will be a name that comes to mind you could hear it from your ears or in your mind it will come quick remember the name because it is the name of your guardian

thoughts or names that linger are not the name of your guardian its the name that pops in and out of your thoughts
