You know you’re an Aries: born March 20 – April 21.

 Are you looking for your match? Do you think you’ve found your match already, but you’re not sure? Do you just want to understand how to navigate a relationship?

Read on for help on all of these topics of Aries compatibility.

 ## Basic Concept

You’re an Aires if you were born from March 20 to April 21 (varies slightly depending on the year).

The sign is associated with fire, Mars, and red. Aires tend to be leaders and hot-headed. They are energetic and type-A personalities.

 There are a few ways to approach relationships as an Aires. You can look for “opposites attract” or true compatibility. You will want to stay away from other fiery people that want to take charge.

 You’re probably the type to want to win an argument, and though making up can be hot, a partner who also has this quality will lead to long-term incompatibility.

 Perfect compatibility will come from a mate that likes cleaning up after the fight. You’ll be on to the next project, and so a mate that is detail-oriented and cautious will balance the relationship.

You tend to lose patience quickly, so you’ll also want a patient mate that knows how to soothe you during delays and inactive times.

 You should beware of true opposites, though. You share your love and affection freely, so you may not read the signs of someone too introverted or shy if things aren’t working for them. True opposites may also find themselves getting jealous.

 Now that the basics are out of the way, let’s dig deeper into the specific pairings.

## Aries and Aries

Be cautious of pairing with another Aries. It can work with considerable planning and compromise. You’re both passionate and want to dominate.

 To make this work, you’ll need to be willing to submit to your partner’s will at times. Admit when you’re wrong and don’t gloat when you’re right.

 You’re both independent. With all your other projects and leadership roles, you might find yourself exhausted and resenting your partner for not picking up the slack.

This can work, but be wary of entering this relationship. Once the passion and lust wear off, you might find it to be not worth the effort.

 ## Aries and Taurus

Taurus is going to be stubborn, but this is a good thing. As an Aries, you will probably be turned off by too much passivity.

 This is the type of passion and competition that can be good for you. As opposed to the Aries/Aries pairing, Taurus can rule with you instead of against you.

Be wary of a Taurus that tries to dominate too much. A good Taurus match will stand his ground and keep pace with you without blowing up or taming you.

 ## Aries and Gemini

You fall for Geminis and fast. Geminis are fun and entertaining. They keep pace with your life, but also provide that much-needed break from your hard work.

 They are, without a doubt, great compatibility. You should pay very close attention to the course of the relationship, though. Geminis don’t take things as seriously as you.

What you perceive as an intense love could be a fling for them. Use your words if you want to keep your Gemini around. Make sure you’re on the same page. You don’t want to be surprised by a sudden breakup when the next fun thing comes along.

 ## Aries and Cancer

This is one of the trickiest pairings for an Aries. Cancer is yielding and loving and motherly. It will initially feel like a perfect synergy of passion and tenderness.

 Unfortunately, that will wear off fast. You have no interest in being protected, and the relationship will quickly turn to one in which you feel like you are being controlled.

This doesn’t have to be the case. So, you must define your boundaries early. You also don’t like the drama a Cancer will bring.

 The Cancer needs to have separate friends as an outlet for these tendencies. If you manage this, the pairing can be good.

 ## Aries and Leo

Leo is another fire sign. This will be a relationship of hot passion. You’ll both be able to do your own things without fear of jealousy or neediness.

You do need to be wary of your partner outshining you. It’s just in your nature to compare yourself to everyone else. You both want to be the best.

 If one of you has success without the other, it could turn into a sour point.

 But don’t shy away from this pairing. It is one of your best. You’ll be very comfortable around each other, and you both understand the other’s motivations well.

 ## Aries and Virgo

Exercise caution when dating a Virgo. Virgos tend to be pure and prudent. You will probably find it hard to get excited about each other sexually.

 You’ll see someone too shy to be arousing. They’ll find you too outgoing and promiscuous. There can be few opposites that attract Virgos for you, but this will be an exception.

 Outside of the bed, this is one of the better matches. Virgo has the patience and internal calm to deal with your more explosive moments. Virgo lovingly puts you back together and ties up loose ends.

 You’ll open them up to new people, places, and experiences. It’s a great match if you don’t push too hard and can find the passion in bed you’ll need.

 ## Aries and Libra

This is a relationship that will need work. It’s great Aries compatibility, though: fighter meets lover. You won’t understand each other’s motivations, but that won’t matter.

 You complement each other, and so as long as you find a way to get past your main differences, it will work. You’ll find yourself frustrated at the restraint of the Libra.

 Go into this relationship knowing you need to balance each other. You’ll annoy the other, but through compromise, this is a pairing that can work.

 ## Aries and Scorpio

Scorpio pushes your buttons. You upset easily, and they can do it every time, effortlessly. You don’t understand your attraction, but it is undeniable.

 You want to punch them, but this only seems to drive them wilder and rile you up more. This is an exciting, volatile pairing. The sex will be great.

You’re opposites, and you attract because of this. Nothing makes sense in this relationship, but it seems to work anyway.

 Embrace this. Do not fear the teasing or Scorpio’s questionable motivations. They aren’t doing these things to hurt you, and so as long as you don’t take it personally, this can work.

 ## Aries and Sagittarius

Sagittarius can be more controlling than you want. You have a lot in common, and one of those things is independence.

 While you’re okay with Sagittarius off on their own, they may not give you the same freedom. Neither of you is a team player, and as you try to lead each other, you can find the relationship falling apart.

 The arguments aren’t hot, and you’re both too stubborn to get around to the making-up part.

 If you fall seriously for a Sagittarius, you’re going to need to navigate this with caution. This pairing can make for a great fling, but the long-term potential is rough.

## Aries and Capricorn

Capricorn can be a great match for you. Capricorn is willing to work for the relationship. They also compliment your need to go from project to project with a hard persistence to see things through to the end.

 Capricorn won’t back down from your more intense moments and wants to ride it out. They want you to succeed as much as you do and will put in the work to help without feeling the need to put their own problems first.

 Capricorn is one of the better Aries compatibility.

## Aries and Aquarius

Aquarius may be drawn to you, but you will probably not have the long-term patience for an Aquarius.

 Aquarius is introverted, calm, and contemplative. They like the idea of you, but they will probably burn out fast. Because of the initial projection onto you, it can start hot.

 Be wary to not misinterpret this. At their core, they cannot sustain it. Once the true Aquarius colors come out, they’ll retreat to reading books in bed when you want to go out.

 You will become bored and annoyed by this behavior. If the relationship is genuine and meant to be, you can make it work by giving each other the freedom to be their true selves.

 Aquarius’s thoughtfulness can provide a nice compliment to your long-term plans.

## Aries and Pisces

There will be a lot on the surface to like about this pairing. You play off each other well, and to everyone else, it looks like you’re perfect.

 You both like physical affection and new experiences in bed. But be wary of your natural tendencies. Pisces follows and you lead. This can quickly turn into a dysfunctional situation.

 Pisces will fall for you fast, so make sure to keep your relationship status known before you hurt the Pisces.

This is a tricky pairing to navigate. Your opposite qualities can complement each other, but they can also lead to a lot of friction.
