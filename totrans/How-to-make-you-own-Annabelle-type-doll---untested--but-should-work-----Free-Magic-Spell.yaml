    Warning: This doll (if you decide to proceed with this) is a weapon made by my
    race, the yuk, and one that is designed for covert assassination. You must put
    into circulation of it after a week as it activates a week after your creation
    of it. You must set the target(s) and deploy it by then...or the doll targets
    you. At which point, it will kill you off in a period of three days. Note: the
    doll takes a month to reach each target, and takes a period of three days to assassinate
    each target. And it assassinates each target by cause of accident(s).'

- en: Annabelle is a real doll that has a demon residing inside her. The movie glorifies
    the tale. This spell will not work, but even if it did, do not make a demonic
    doll.

- en: I wonder if that demon ever gets bored. Being stuck in a doll doesn't sound
    fun.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The demon is really evil, based on what I've heard, and is meant to always be
    kept in sacred glass in the Warren's room of the supernatural (where they store
    everything from past supernatural encounters). Not every entity is evil, but Annabelle
    definitely is. A guy in a motorcycle mocked the entity, and three hours later,
    he died of a car crash, I think. Anyway, you probably won't be able to make a
    doll like Annabelle. It would take a lot of power and energy to bind an entity
    that's so powerful.
