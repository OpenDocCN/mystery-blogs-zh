    situation or holding a lot of resentment, counseling would probably work better
    than a spell.

- en: This can work, but a few points. It is not necessary to call in any entities
    if you do not work with them. Some witches work with deities, some do not. Same
    with spirits, fairys, dragons, demons, angels, and anything else. If you work
    with them, call on them, if you do not, a spell can still work without them. As
    for the spell, it can work, but with most banishings and cord cuttings, you might
    need to do it more than once. You cannot rush the process, and you need to sit
    in the pain you are releasing. Once you are finished, you should feel a weight
    lifted off you. This does not mean you will never think of this person again,
    but it does mean the pain you feel will have subsided. Depending on the bond,
    it might require a few banishings, but you should feel a sense of relief when
    this is done correctly.
