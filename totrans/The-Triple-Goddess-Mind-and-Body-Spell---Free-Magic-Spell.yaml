    your circle. After light all the candles & get comfy. Try going deep inside your
    mind as much as possible while dong this spell. Just keep repeating the spell,
    chanting its every word. Feel the power of your chant working up its energy and
    combining with the power of the Goddesses.)

    have successfully worked up enough energy. You may either choose between meditating
    until the candles burn out. Of course that might also require someone with there
    meditation skills down. Otherwise drinking your favorite tea with music going
    in the back ground while you do something preferably calming, like if you enjoy
    writing or drawing. Just try to do something relaxing until the candles completely
    go out.)

    connect with the divine feminine. Use tea light candles so you do not spend hours
    chanting should you try this.
