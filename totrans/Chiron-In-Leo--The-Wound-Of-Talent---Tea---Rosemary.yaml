    Chiron wasn’t originally important in astrology and is a “newer” asteroid, but
    I find it to have huge effects on almost every person’s chart I look at.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Someone with Chiron in Leo will feel that they are not recognized or noticed
    for their specialness. They might feel like they fade into the background.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some cases this person may actually feel disliked, but they can also just
    feel ignored or unnoticed.  They will feel that they are not talented enough,
    not noticed for their talent, or generally unremarkable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What’s funny is that people with Chiron in Leo are often pretty talented in
    some way. They can have issues related to how they *feel* about their talent as
    well as ego issues surrounding other people’s adoration of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is usually because although people with Chiron in Leo try to show their
    talent to *others*, *they* aren’t actually convinced deep down that they have
    any talent at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At its core, Chiron in Leo creates a fear of joining in without a talent or
    reason; in reality, the person can join in groups or life just for the sake of
    existing. They are special just for being themselves, but feel worthless and do
    not realize this.

- en: The Chiron in Leo wound will manifest in one of two ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**In one case**, the person with Chiron in Leo may try their hardest to be
    recognized, respected, or loved. They may try to get appreciation or attention
    and often attempt to be “famous” in some manner. They will do this to try and
    prove to themselves that they have no reason to feel unworthy, but that does not
    change the core feelings that they still have deep down.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**In the second case,** the person feels so unworthy of being the center of
    attention that they avoid the spotlight by any means possible. They will support
    *others* in this role (often children) by trying to help others gain notoriety
    and become successful in the spotlight.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In both cases, the person will be unusually sensitive to criticism. This insecurity
    can cause them to read into a situation and feel that they’ve been criticized
    when it isn’t true. They have a strong fear of rejection stemming from their own
    feelings of worthlessness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both types of Chiron in Leo people will also feel that they need to prove their
    worth through their talents or the talents of others; in either case they are
    always working towards proving themselves to the world. They don’t understand
    that they have nothing to prove.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look at the house and aspects to see exactly *how* the person will feel a need
    to prove themselves. For example, if Chiron is in the 10th house, the person will
    try to prove themselves through career or public image, while Chiron in the 2nd
    house may mean the person attempts to feel worthy through money and possessions.

- en: This wound, more-so than others, usually has roots in childhood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I typically find that a person with Chiron in Leo was stunted (in some way)
    from expressing themselves creatively. This person probably did not get sufficient
    recognition from their parents during early childhood for their ideas or talents
    and this left them feeling worthless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The child may have felt unimportant, unseen, or dismissed. They just weren’t *noticed*,
    or at worst they were noticed in a bad way (such as their parents remarking on
    their lack of talent).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A person with Chiron in Leo needs to learn how to heal the inner child and accept *themselves.*
    It is the lack of self-acceptance and self-praise that causes the wound, although
    the person probably thinks it is the lack of acceptance from others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key is to recognize that this person has it within their power to realize
    how special they are and to find their gift to the Universe. With this placement,
    they have a really important place in the world and a unique gift to offer, but
    it is up to them to work through trauma and find it.
  prefs: []

- en: Inner child work may be extremely helpful if the individual finds that these
    issues do stem from childhood.

    birth charts. Mostly, Chiron in Leo is in the charts of people who aren’t just
    famous but who are trendsetters or global sensations.

    but I can only assume that this is the driver for these folks to work towards
    fame. Alternatively, they might be child stars (or born into a famous family)
    but feel that they aren’t seen for their true self.
