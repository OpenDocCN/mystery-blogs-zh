# How To Steal A Soul For Profit or Trading

A spell specifically designed to steal a soul. (It is best to do it on someone who is dying soon).

NOTE: If used on a living person it will not take all of their soul. It will take anywhere from 80% to 10% if it but as soon as they die the rest will go to the object if it has the higher amount of soul. The amount of soul in the object determines how it feels. Also if the peraon is alive they will feel a pull to go tworda where it is and should they touch it they will get it back.

The soul is a problematic thing to store, and will easily be pulled back to the body, if it is alive.

You cannot buy and sell souls.
