    have an irresistible personality. They can be frustrating to have as friends and
    companions because they embody human nature at its best and worst. Their deep
    and often conflicting emotions can be hard to understand. But their passion is
    unmatched, as they are highly sensitive and approach everything with intensity.

- en: Scorpios love intensely and are passionate, sensual, and loyal lovers. Their
    desire for intimacy and vulnerability can result in physically and emotionally
    fulfilling relationships. But conversely, their unbridled passion can lead to
    jealousy, possession, and resentment. A Scorpio will never forget a grudge, but
    their emotional intelligence will make them a wonderful partner in a deep and
    long-lasting relationship. Scorpios are highly secretive, and maintain an air
    of mystery everywhere they go. This can create an enticing allure, but it can
    also lead to distrust, suspicion, or deception. In order to stay private, Scorpio’s
    outward appearance may mask what they are *truly* thinking or feeling.

- en: The extremely intuitive Scorpio is not interested in the mundane and day-to-day.
    They won’t form friendships with shallow personalities. Scorpios are introspective
    and comfortable delving into the shadowy areas of their consciousness. They value
    personal growth and look for hidden meaning and mysticism in all areas of life.

- en: The Scorpio is also a survivor. In pursuit of their goals, Scorpios are resourceful,
    strong, and determined. They have great resourcefulness and tenacity to withstand
    any situation. They can pull out deep willpower and use it to battle for control
    with anyone who stands in their way. But this power is a double-edged sword. When
    backed into a corner, Scorpio may resort to manipulation and underhanded tactics.Magick
    & RitualsScorpio magick is deep and mysterious. Psychic endeavors and development
    are especially powerful. Look for answers to deep questions, uncover secrets,
    and build your intuition. You can explore past lives as well.

  zh: 天蝎座也是一个幸存者。在追求目标时，天蝎座具有资源丰富、坚强和决心。他们拥有极强的机智和坚韧，能够应对任何情况。他们可以激发深层的意志力，并用它来与任何阻碍他们的人竞争控制权。但这种力量是一把双刃剑。当被逼入绝境时，天蝎座可能会诉诸于操纵和不正当手段。魔法与仪式天蝎座的魔法深邃而神秘。心灵的努力和发展尤为强大。寻找深刻问题的答案，揭示秘密并培养直觉。你还可以探索前世生活。

  zh: 天蝎座还涉及死亡与重生。因此，可以使用与转化、更新和创造性创作相关的魔法。
- en: Scorpios tend to absorb the emotional energy around them. So regular focus on
    mental health is important, and they must regularly create balance and peace in
    their lives. Spiritual cleansings, soul healing, catharsis, and personal re-dedication
    is key.Full MoonThe Scorpio full moon falls opposite its new moon. So when the
    sun is in Taurus, Scorpio hosts a full moon. This also contains the sabbat of
    Beltane.Full Moon MagickDuring the Scorpio full moon, meditate on attachments
    in your life. Consider how attachments have brought you joy, but also consider
    how they have brought you grief. Think about the wonderful friends and family
    you’ve had, whether they are still here or have passed on. The cycle of life is
    just a part of the human experience. Cultivate awe at how we are able to form
    deep attachment with loved ones. But also realize their brief nature of these
    bonds as nothing in life stays the same forever.New MoonThe Scorpio new moon occurs
    while the sun is also in the sign, so it will fall within Scorpio and contain
    the sabbat of Samhain.New Moon MagickWhen the moon transits Scorpio, it is a time
    to let go of what does not enrich us. We can let go of past wrongs, heartbreaks,
    and regrets. Focus on creating a fresh start. Use this time to forge a new beginning.
    What are your new intentions? What new self-care do you need? Focus on creating
    a new start for yourself, reborn and free of past baggage. Pull the Death card
    to see what ending you need in your life. Work with the element of water to cleanse
    yourself of old energies and start fresh.

  zh: 天蝎座倾向于吸收周围的情感能量。因此，定期关注心理健康至关重要，他们必须经常在生活中创造平衡和和平。精神净化、灵魂愈合、宣泄和个人重申是关键。满月天蝎座的满月与其新月相对立。因此，当太阳处于金牛座时，天蝎座举办满月。这也包含贝尔塔尼节日。满月魔法在天蝎座的满月期间，沉思生活中的依恋。考虑依恋如何给你带来喜悦，但也考虑它们如何给你带来痛苦。想想你曾经拥有的美好朋友和家人，无论他们是否还在这里或已经过世。生命的循环只是人类经历的一部分。敬畏我们如何能够与所爱的人形成深厚的依恋。但也意识到这些纽带的短暂性，因为生活中没有什么能永远不变。新月天蝎座的新月发生在太阳也在该星座的时候，因此它将落在天蝎座内并包含萨文节日。新月魔法当月亮经过天蝎座时，是放下那些不丰富我们的东西的时候。我们可以放下过去的错事、心碎和遗憾。专注于创造一个新的开始。利用这段时间来铸造一个新的开端。你的新意图是什么？你需要什么新的自我关怀？专注于为自己创造一个新的开始，重新出生并摆脱过去的包袱。抽出死亡牌，看看你生活中需要结束的事情。使用水元素来清洁你自己的旧能量并重新开始。
