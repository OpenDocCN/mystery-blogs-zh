    purpleTraits & GiftsScorpios are the most intense of all zodiac signs, but also
    have an irresistible personality. They can be frustrating to have as friends and
    companions because they embody human nature at its best and worst. Their deep
    and often conflicting emotions can be hard to understand. But their passion is
    unmatched, as they are highly sensitive and approach everything with intensity.

- en: Scorpios love intensely and are passionate, sensual, and loyal lovers. Their
    desire for intimacy and vulnerability can result in physically and emotionally
    fulfilling relationships. But conversely, their unbridled passion can lead to
    jealousy, possession, and resentment. A Scorpio will never forget a grudge, but
    their emotional intelligence will make them a wonderful partner in a deep and
    long-lasting relationship. Scorpios are highly secretive, and maintain an air
    of mystery everywhere they go. This can create an enticing allure, but it can
    also lead to distrust, suspicion, or deception. In order to stay private, Scorpio’s
    outward appearance may mask what they are *truly* thinking or feeling.

- en: The extremely intuitive Scorpio is not interested in the mundane and day-to-day.
    They won’t form friendships with shallow personalities. Scorpios are introspective
    and comfortable delving into the shadowy areas of their consciousness. They value
    personal growth and look for hidden meaning and mysticism in all areas of life.

- en: The Scorpio is also a survivor. In pursuit of their goals, Scorpios are resourceful,
    strong, and determined. They have great resourcefulness and tenacity to withstand
    any situation. They can pull out deep willpower and use it to battle for control
    with anyone who stands in their way. But this power is a double-edged sword. When
    backed into a corner, Scorpio may resort to manipulation and underhanded tactics.Magick
    & RitualsScorpio magick is deep and mysterious. Psychic endeavors and development
    are especially powerful. Look for answers to deep questions, uncover secrets,
    and build your intuition. You can explore past lives as well.

    magick for intimacy, erotic arts, fertility rituals, labor blessings, and birth
    celebrations.

- en: Scorpios tend to absorb the emotional energy around them. So regular focus on
    mental health is important, and they must regularly create balance and peace in
    their lives. Spiritual cleansings, soul healing, catharsis, and personal re-dedication
    is key.Full MoonThe Scorpio full moon falls opposite its new moon. So when the
    sun is in Taurus, Scorpio hosts a full moon. This also contains the sabbat of
    Beltane.Full Moon MagickDuring the Scorpio full moon, meditate on attachments
    in your life. Consider how attachments have brought you joy, but also consider
    how they have brought you grief. Think about the wonderful friends and family
    you’ve had, whether they are still here or have passed on. The cycle of life is
    just a part of the human experience. Cultivate awe at how we are able to form
    deep attachment with loved ones. But also realize their brief nature of these
    bonds as nothing in life stays the same forever.New MoonThe Scorpio new moon occurs
    while the sun is also in the sign, so it will fall within Scorpio and contain
    the sabbat of Samhain.New Moon MagickWhen the moon transits Scorpio, it is a time
    to let go of what does not enrich us. We can let go of past wrongs, heartbreaks,
    and regrets. Focus on creating a fresh start. Use this time to forge a new beginning.
    What are your new intentions? What new self-care do you need? Focus on creating
    a new start for yourself, reborn and free of past baggage. Pull the Death card
    to see what ending you need in your life. Work with the element of water to cleanse
    yourself of old energies and start fresh.
