- en: If you feel that your love is not as intense as it once was, and you want to
    bring back those feelings, this spell should assist you in achieving your goals.
    In the best case scenario, you need to have a fire in your spell area. However,
    if this can’t be done, prepare some coal. Once the circle is open, walk away and
    bring the coal and some leaves to the fireplace. It is always possible to use
    your barbecue as well.

    would. However, if you had to go elsewhere to conduct the spell, you need to go
    back to your sacred space the same way that you left it. Once you have returned,
    you can finish as normal.
