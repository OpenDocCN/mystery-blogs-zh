    tarot cards!

- en: So before we begin this spell it would be best to meditate on your animal for
    10 minutes or so, so as to relax yourself and be able to concentrate on who you're
    looking for. When you feel relaxed enough to begin, light the two or three candles
    and set them either parallel to each other with a foot of space if 2, or a triangle
    formation with about a foot of space with 3\. So using the tarot deck, figure
    out the signifacator card of your pet. Cards that can be used as significators
    for animals include the 9 OF PENTACLES, THE STAR, and the ACE OF CUPS for birds;
    the QUEEN OF WANDS for cats; STRENGTH for domestic cats and big cats like lions
    and tigers; THE MOON, THE FOOL, and the 10 OF PENTACLES for dogs and wolves; the
    PAGE OF CUPS and The MOON for fish and aquatic life; THE SUN, the 6 OF WANDS,
    and all of the KNIGHTS for horses; the KING OF WANDS for lizards and reptiles,
    the QUEEN OF PENTACLES for rabbits; and THE LOVERS for snakes. However, if a particular
    card feels right for your animal, feel free to use that instead!

    the Magician, and the Hermit.

- en: So now that we have all that figured out, in the center of the candles place
    down the significator. Visualize the animal, recalling its features and mannerisms
    to the best of your ability. Picture the missing pet being drawn to the light
    of the candles--to the light of love. Hold your hands above the candle flames
    for a few moments. Feel the warmth of the candles, and visualize the light of
    the candles acting as a beacon to lead the animal home.

    you and your pet have had together. Try to remember the day you first got your
    pet, what they were like as a youngster, etc.
