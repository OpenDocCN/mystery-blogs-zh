    and making ice and snow from either hand.I will be able to adapt to the coldest
    environment and temperatures, with these powers I can creat anything I want, I
    will be able to creat snow storms. I can create a snowman and it will come to
    life and have a joyful life and funny personality, but make it do harm to none,
    But with new found powers will become my weaknesses , these powers will not be
    a curse but, they will become dangerous if I I''m not careful about my powers.
    If I get scared or mad I will freeze everything and snow will fall. So shall it
    be!"'
