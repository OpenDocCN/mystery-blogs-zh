 First, to gain this item you need a live goose, so for those in a city, it may need to be bought from a reliable supplier.

take your goose in your arms on a Thursday night at 12am or 24:00, In the light of the full moon chant this while plunging the white knife into his heart:

"I sacrifice you, oh marvelous, unequaled bird, in this solemn hour in honor of the mighty and sublime Adonay, to who I devote the first of my works, that you through the gift of your magical feathers, serve me well in all my experiments."

Finally, take the fifth feather on the right wing at the bone ridge of the wing.
