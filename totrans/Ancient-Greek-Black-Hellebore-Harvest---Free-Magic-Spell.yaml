    If you do not work with those ritual tools, consider a respectful way to demarcate
    the harvest space. Request permission to gather the plant from Apollo and his
    son Asklepios, the plant's presiding spirits.

- en: What on earth does this do? Since this was taken from Judika Illes Encyclopedia
    of 5000 spells, I will look it up for clarification. (top of page 30) This is
    not a spell, it is better classified as a ritual or spiritual rite. There are
    several harvest spells listed on page 30 of the book from various cultures. This
    is a way to honour the plant spirit if you follow a Hellenic path. This is literally
    word for work plagiarized from the book, but it should be fleshed out more and
    given a better explanation. The spell book begins with an explanation of how the
    spells work and how to cast spells. This section also has an explanation of what
    the harvest spells are used for. This is why the spells are such barebones guides.
    It is for the experienced Witch to flip to the specific section, read the spell
    recipe and then do it including are the necessary steps required for a successful
    spell. This specific *spell* is used when harvesting plants for a spiritual purpose.
    You are giving thanks to the plant you are harvesting so the item you took is
    not tainted with negative energy because you stole from the plant. As mentioned,
    this would be the Hellenic (Greek) way of giving thanks to the plant spirit. If
    this resonates with you, use it. I would say every harvest ritual that is meant
    to thank the plant for allowing you to harvest what you need follows the same
    process. Approach the plant, introduce yourself, ask permission, wait for a response,
    leave offering. The only difference I see is you call on a Greek deity. I would
    suggest using rosemary incense, cypress incense, or another herb that is sacred
    in Hellenic Witchcraft.

    and meditation first.
