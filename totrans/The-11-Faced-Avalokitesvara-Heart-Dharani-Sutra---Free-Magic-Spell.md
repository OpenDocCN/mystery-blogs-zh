# The 11 Faced Avalokitesvara Heart Dharani Sutra

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This is not to be confused with the words of the Great Compassionate Mantra(also known as Nilakantha Dharani). Many people are often confusing the 11 Faced Avalokitesvara Dharani Sutra with the Great Compassionate Mantra. The Great Compassionate Mantra is actually longer than what most people think.(I'll be posting it later.) This Sutra is said to have been spoken by the Avalokitesvara bodhisattva and can help praising the Avalokitesvara bodhisattva and will recieve greater merit in this life and the next.
