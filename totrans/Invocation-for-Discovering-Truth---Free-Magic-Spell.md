 ## Casting Instructions for 'Invocation for Discovering Truth'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 beeswax candle

*   2 pieces natural paper

*   A pen/pencil

*   Bowl of water

*   Chalk

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 beeswax candle

*   2 pieces natural paper

*   A pen/pencil

*   Bowl of water

*   Chalk

 A single candle of beeswax should be lighted and placed on a table away from the draft and chill. Two pieces of natural paper need be torn to the length of three finger's breadth and the width of two finger's breadth. On each need be written the choices from which Truth shall choose. A bowl of clean water should be placed on the table at thy front and a circle drawn round the bowl. Once the circle be drawn, no more should thy hand pass in.

The following invocation need be spoken aloud and with a firm and somber voice: "In the name of Vuall, I summon thee Truth that thee may choose of these and show that pure. By the virtue of the highest of thee, I command thee come forth lest thee suffer the pain of disobedience."

Fold each piece of paper singly and cast them together into the water, not allowing thy hand cross into the circle. That piece which doth unfold first be the answer of Truth and that which unfolds last be the lie. When Truth hath made its choice, dismiss the spirit, extinguish the candle and dispose of the water on freshly turned soil.

If you receive no answer. If Truth does not find the working favorable then he wont tell you
