Arrange in this order from left to right in a slight curve with the center candles being farther then the end candles. Black, blue, green, white, green, blue, black. Place the incense in front of the white candle and place the skull behind the incense (If you have a white candle shaped as a skull, that works too). Smudge your altar with the Sage and Sweet Grass. Meditate in front of your altar as the smoke settles. Light candles one color at a time(Start with black, end with white). Place the stones in front of or around the skull and incense. Chant:

> ''Cerberus, curator of silenti, sino phasmatis venire contra mihi. Phasmatis, radix quod causa of vita, commodo adeo suffragium mihi in meus negotium.''

Meditate until you feel there are spirits around you. Once you feel them near, chant:

> ''Gratias ago vos Cerberus, pro tabellae silenti etc transeo. Gratias ago vos phasmatis pro iunctio mihi in meus nisus.''

And now proceed with your tasks. Note: The stones you use should be kept with you as often as possible. The skull should be kept either on your altar or near your bed.

How will I feel when the spirits are near? What will I feel?

It depends on how well you can sense spirits. If you have a limited ability, you should feel like someones in the room with you, you might feel them touch you if a spirit taps you on the shoulder or something, and you might see something out of the corner of your eye like a shadow figure [if you've seen The Conjuring, the scene where you see what Laurane sees is a shadow figure, that's what I typically see] If you have no clairvoyance [or are just starting to strengthen the ability] you might not see/feel anything [it is believed a random shiver is a spirit passing through you] as you practice, you might be able to see full manifestations. Not everyone can, however. I've worked with spirits my entire life, and while my ''sight'' as weakened over time, I've always been able to hear them [it's distinctly different from thoughts. it would sound like someone's in the room with you] others can't see or hear spirits, but they can smell them, or get a strong emotion. It depends on your talents.

In case anyone's wondering, you can get actual human and animal bones from TheBoneRoom.com. It's totally legal since they only take bones humanely or from dead bodies and clean them very thoroughly, so no health hazards either. If real bones aren't your thing, you can also take casts which are fake bones of a sort. There's also another website (can't remember the name) which sells pieces of amber with something inside of it (insects, beetles, stuff like that).
