    one, or two. You can also have a formation/shape of crystals underneath or in
    between your hands (depending on how many crystals your using.) Use what ever

    and over in their head. Visualise what they are thinking in their head turning
    into energy and flowing into your body. Go through the numbers in your head until
    you reach the one that really shouts out at you. Ask them if that was their number,
    If they say yes, congratulations! If not, keep practicing. If you don't trust
    them, make them write it down and hide it before you start.
