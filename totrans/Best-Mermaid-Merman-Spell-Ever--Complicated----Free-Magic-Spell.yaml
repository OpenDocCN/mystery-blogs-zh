    now if you couldn't before, you can choose your tail colour, you can change the
    spell to suit your desires This has not been tested, but please send me mail with

- en: Fae are just another way to say fairy, and while some might include elves, gnomes,
    and mermaids into fae, it is not a world of mythological creatures. This does
    not transform you into a mermaid, Magic does not do physical transformations.
