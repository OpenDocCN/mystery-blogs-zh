- en: The best day for doing this spell is Tuesdays because it provides the faint-hearted
    with a boldness. Cast the spell in Aires, on a Tuesday, when the moon is either
    full or waxing. Dress in red clothing and use a red cloth to cover your altar
    to provide your magic with added potency.

    on the burner. Light your white candle and then kneel down. Focus on the flame
    while you are asking silently for the courage to be able to face whatever challenges
    might lie ahead for you. Visualize yourself being triumphant in all situations.
    Light your red candle. Stand up to your full height while in front of your altar,
    holding your hands high over your head. Say these following words:'
