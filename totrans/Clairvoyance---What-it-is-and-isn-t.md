*When it comes to clairvoyance, sometimes people think that it's something that, in reality, it either is or isn't. This can be confusing for the one who is trying to understand how to develop this faculty when they might not be able to exactly pinpoint what it is that they're trying to develop.*

> Clairvoyance is a term that has been used for centuries to describe an ability to see things that are not visible to the naked eye.

#### It has been used to describe everything from the ability to see into the future to the ability to detect energies, entities, and other phenomena that are not visible to the human eye.

Clairvoyance has been a part of many spiritual and religious practices throughout history. The term “clairvoyance” can be broken down into two parts. “Clair” is a French word meaning “clear” or “clear sight” and “voyance” is derived from the Latin word “visio” meaning “vision.” Together, these two words can be translated to mean “clear sight” or “clear seeing.”

> **Clairvoyance**  *is about intuition and perception. The psychic ability to be able to use one's inner senses to receive "images" or observe an inner pictorial language, in one's own mind, related to questions or various in-sights.*

Sometimes people assume that Clairvoyance means they have to see things in front of themselves physically, in such detail and realism that they shouldn't even be able to tell the difference between their reality and their vision. The truth is, this is not the case for a majority of psychic clairvoyants. **Most visions are seen through the "mind's eye,**" in a similar manner like you would day dream or envision a scene from a movie.

### Clairvoyance is not always a person being able to perfectly see the past, present, and future of the universe - its beginning, middle, and end.

But using what one sees, combined with their intuition, and sometimes divination, to put together likely occurring events. It's not always about someone being able to know absolutely everything about a person and their previous incarnations, however, if one has clairvoyance well developed, they may become more aware of the subtleties in a person's life based on that person's character and how they present themselves.

> In addition, it is important to understand that clairvoyance is not a form of fortune-telling. People who are clairvoyant do not have the ability to predict the future. Instead, they are able to gain insight into the present and past, as well as to gain understanding about the energies, entities, and other phenomena that exist around them.

Therefore, the clairvoyant is simply **perceiving the energy that is made available to them**, in whatever way. Sometimes it can be very telling, other times a certain energy can even seem so pure that it appears as if it was intentionally being well disguised. The more practiced and developed one is with this faculty, and also the more pure one's character is, the better they'll be able to read things with the use of clairvoyance, which is **a**  **completely natural ability**.

Through practice, one learns how to read situations and events even better, according to their own inner sight, and can make more and **more informed judgements** of the future based on the previous success that they've had, which they can continue to draw from and build upon with the development of this faculty.

Clairvoyance is a term that has been used for centuries to describe an ability to see things that are not visible to the naked eye. **It is not a magical ability or a form of fortune-telling, and it is not something that can be acquired overnight.** People who are clairvoyant are simply able to access information that is not available to the average person, and they are not able to control or manipulate others. Understanding the true nature of clairvoyance is essential to being able to use it responsibly.
