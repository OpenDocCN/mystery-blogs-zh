**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your chosen amulet

*   A glass of spring water

 *   Place a crystal or amulet that you regularly carry in the glass of spring water a day before the Full Moon.
*   The following day, on the evening of the Full Moon, stir the water three times with your right hand in a clockwise motion.
*   Then take the glass in your hands and swirl the water in it around, moving the glass in a clockwise, circular, stirring motion three times.
*   Then repeat these words aloud: Oh Light of the Moon

Wrap me Protect me Keep me from harm.  

*   Remove your amulet from the glass.
*   Raise the glass towards the sky, acknowledging the Moon.
*   Lower the glass, bring it to your lips and drink the water.
*   Carry the amulet with you till the next Full Moon in order to ensure full protection.
*   Repeat this process every month to benefit from the amulet’s influence. When an object has been blessed by the Moon, you enter under her protection. You symbolically take in her power by drinking the water. Amulets are seemingly inanimate objects which have been given power by the incantation.

This can work, just be sure the amulet your chose to submerge in the water is non-toxic. If it is toxic, you can place it beside the glass of water for the same result.
