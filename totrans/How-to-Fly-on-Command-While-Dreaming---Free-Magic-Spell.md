if you need to rush or glide while dreaming say wings and imagine giant wings coming out you back any way you lean will guide you in that direction.

if you need to lift using you wings (this is silly) flap your arms but try not to touch any part of your body while doing this you'll wake up.

if you need to rush with your wings place both arms at your side and imagine rushing towards your target this can get really intense depending on how fast you go the faster you go the more you heart races don't hurt yourself doing this.

if you need to go up a lot faster with more control imagine a jet pack this will cause you to rise into the air steadly you will have to tell the jet pack which way to go out loud.

if already flying or hovering above ground in a dream which ever way you lean is where you will go.

good luck

Lucid dreaming takes practice, and mastering flight is rather difficult for many in dreams, but try this a few times to see if it helps in any way. I would combine it with a dream pillow or other spell to ensure you will be lucid dreaming.
