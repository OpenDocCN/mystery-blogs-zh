 ## Casting Instructions for 'How to Contact your Spirit Animal'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 glass plate

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 glass plate

*   Salt (depending on how large plate is, should fill it with a thin layer.)

*   2 white candles

*   1 silver charm or jewelry

*   2 small mirrors

*   1 cup of water

 Find out what your spirit animal is. You can take a quiz, but usually what you feel in your gut is the right one. Know your animal. Research it. Find out a little about it's way of life.

Place the plate in front of you. Sprinkle salt until there is a thin layer of it in the plate. Place the mirrors on the right and left the plate. They should be facing each other. Light the candles and place them on either side of the plate, but outside of the mirrors. Each mirror should have a candle behind it.

Make a hole in the center of the plate of salt with your finger. It should be about 3 cm. in all directions. Make 8 rays coming out from the circle, making a kind of sun pattern. Pour the water in the circle in the center. Watch it go through the rays like a stream. Do not overflow or underfill. Place silver charm/jewelry in the center of the circle. It should be in water.

Recite:
"Myself is at war with me,
My spirit is not clean
Help me by my side, great  (say the animal name)
Make me at peace once again."

Blow out candles. Blow out the left one first. To communicate with it, Speak into the mirror on the left. It will respond (if it wishes) through the right mirror. Don't be pushy or mean.

Your spirit animal is not your animal form and is not determined by your personality. Spirit animals are a native belief and a closed practice. Spirit guides are similar and not closed. Both spirit guides and spirit animals are animal spirits who guide and protect people on their spiritual journey, but spirit animals have deeper spiritual significance to native spirituality. Guides are with you for a time and can change as needed. You might want a wolf because it is cool, but that does not mean you need the wisdom of a wolf spirit to guide you at this time.
