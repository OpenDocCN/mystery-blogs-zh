You might have seen people wearing pentagram necklaces or carrying around crystals, and wondered what in the world they’re up to. Chances are, they’re practicing Wicca, a pagan religion that is seeing a resurgence in popularity.

 Wicca has been around for centuries, but it’s only recently that it has begun to gain mainstream attention. There are many reasons for this, but chief among them is the fact that Wicca is an earth-based religion that is deeply connected to nature.

 In this article, we’ll discuss the history and basics of Wicca, and explore its vital importance in the modern world.

 ## Wicca Is an Earth-Based Religion That Celebrates Nature

Wicca is a nature-based religion that honors the Earth and all of its creatures. It celebrates the cycles of the seasons and the phases of the moon, and its worshippers believe in a deity that is both male and female.

 One of the reasons Wicca is gaining popularity is because it’s an earth-based religion.

Every year that goes by causes humans to become more and more online and addicted to their phones. We are completely disconnected from everything important in the world.

 People are searching for ways to connect with nature, and Wicca provides a spiritual connection that resonates with many people.

 Every Wiccan I know follows the Wheel of the Year. We have a personal connection to nature and so we see firsthand how it is changing around us. Many people have no understanding of how climate change is happening, but returning to these roots helps us see the changes and drives us to save the Earth.

Additionally, Wiccans are always looking to promote peace, love, and harmony, which is something that people are drawn to in these turbulent times.

 ## Wiccans Believe in the Wiccan Rede, Which Is “An It Harm None, Do as You Will”

Wiccans believe in the [Wiccan Rede](https://craftofwicca.com/what-is-wiccan-law-the-wiccan-rede-explained/), which is “An it harm none, do as you will.”

This means that Wiccans are free to do whatever they want as long as it doesn’t harm anyone else. This is one of the reasons why Wicca is gaining popularity; people are looking for a religion that allows them to live their lives in accordance with their own beliefs.

 This is an especially important concept in 2023\. The online world of Facebook, Twitter, and other social media is full of divisiveness and tearing people down for what they do and believe.

 Our world is not going to survive this hatred and proscriptions on behavior.

Wicca is a vitally important way of living that promotes a way out of this. We live and let live. We practice in our own ways, and this is considered okay. We promote love and not the hate that is so pervasive.

It’s very important that our world starts moving toward belief systems that are more tolerant if we want to survive in a globally connected ecosystem.

 ## Wicca Is a Positive, Inclusive Spirituality Without Dogma

There are a number of reasons why Wicca is gaining popularity as an important religion in 2023.

One of the main reasons is that it is a positive, inclusive religion. Wiccans celebrate nature and the cycles of life, which is a refreshing change from the dogmatic and judgmental attitudes found in some other religions.

Moreover, Wicca is a very hands-on religion. Witches don’t just sit around and pray, they take action to create change in the world. This can be seen in the numerous charities and social causes that Wiccans support.

 All in all, Wicca is a growing religion because it offers something that people are looking for: a sense of community, acceptance, and empowerment.

 In short, Wicca is a Pagan religion that is focused on the natural world and the cycle of the seasons. People who practice Wicca often see the divine in all things and believe that we should live in harmony with nature.

One of the things that makes Wicca so popular is that it is a very flexible religion.

 Let’s face it. Traditional religions are almost completely dead. We just understand too much about the world, and so we see how these ancient texts are full of rules that make no sense.

They were written by flawed humans that wanted to exert control over other people, many times leading to treating humans as property.

 The rules are divisive and discriminatory and sexist. We’ve outgrown these religions, but people still have a deep need for spirituality.

 In Wicca, there are no strict rules or dogma, which makes it perfect for people who are looking for spiritual practice but don’t want to be tied down by dogma.

 You come to believe what you believe, and that’s fine.

## Wicca Is a Religion for People Who Want to Connect With Nature

As you can see, Wicca is a versatile and adaptable religion that caters to the needs of people who want to connect with nature.

 It offers a spiritual connection to the natural world, as well as a sense of community and support. If you’re interested in learning more about Wicca, or if you feel like you could identify with its values, then 2022 is the year to do it!

 Wicca requires extended amounts of time and effort without technology.

 This is one of the ways we can get our attention spans back. Our fast-paced media of short clips has ruined our brains.

 Wicca gets you into nature and off your phone. It connects you with things that are actually important: the Earth, nature, spirituality, and more.

There are so few things left in the world that can do this. Wicca is of vital importance because it lets us reclaim our lives. Most of us drift through life with no purpose or focus.

 We’re just existing and letting corporations dictate our time, attention, and money.

 Performing a spell under the moon takes a lot of preparation and fills you with awe at the mysteries of the universe.

 Wicca connects us to history and tradition. No one cares about preserving these practices anymore, but they remind us where we’ve come from as a species. Carrying on with ancient traditions is an important part of preservation that has been lost in 2023.

 ## Wiccans Believe in the Power of Magic and the Ability to Create Change

One of the things that makes Wicca so popular is the belief in the power of magic. Wiccans believe that they can use their magical powers to create change in the world and improve their own lives.

 This makes Wicca a very positive, empowering religion that attracts people who want to make a difference in the world.

In 2023, most people have lost their belief in their ability to cause meaningful change. We’ve lost track of our roots.

Stop complaining on the internet. Stop despairing.

 Go out there and be the change you want to see—actually enact your beliefs.

 You can make the world a better place, but it’s not through social media. Wicca is one way you can reconnect to yourself and start making a difference.

 ## Conclusion

As we move further into the 21st century, more and more people are turning to Wicca as a way of life. This pagan religion is based on principles of nature, and its followers believe in the power of the earth and the gods and goddesses who inhabit it.

 Wicca is not only a spiritual practice but also a lifestyle, and its followers often find great satisfaction in living their lives in harmony with the natural world.
