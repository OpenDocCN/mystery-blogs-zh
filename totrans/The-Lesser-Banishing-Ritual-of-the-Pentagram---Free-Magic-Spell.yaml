    need a Dagger or if you do not have one you may use your index finger. You are
    going to be tracing Pentagrams in the air, vibrating sacred names of the Gods,
    and calling upon the Archangels to surround you. You are going to have to visualize
    these things you do but after much practice you will see the Pentagrams and angels
    and not have to imagine, because they are really there!
