- en: 'Ah, The Fool: Card 0 of the Major Arcana. One traditional use of the tarot
    was to tell a story. The order of the Major Arcana follows that story, and it’s
    sometimes known as ***the fool’s journey***.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The story is a journey from ignorance to enlightenment (The World). He learns
    all the mysteries of the universe. But it’s also a cycle, and we return just as
    we started, as a fool.

    about the symbols that represent a journey or new beginning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He’s about to step off a cliff. This shows ignorance and a carefree attitude
    toward what’s right in front of him. The flower is white and a clear symbol of
    his innocence.
  prefs: []

    will be danger along the way. That is all for the future, though.

    Instead of plunging ahead into new territory, you’re calculating the risks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Fool may be about to walk off the cliff, but at least he has a clear direction.
    When The Fool is reversed, it means you are lacking in this direction. Maybe you
    intentionally turn away from the cliff because you fear those mountains in the
    background.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The dog is a loyal companion on the card. When the Fool is reversed, maybe you
    need to find such a companion to help you start this new beginning.

    symbolism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, and so it’s
    good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to
    have a good interpretation for the moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember,
    each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards
    is an art, not a science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll use a different deck for every one of these. Today’s is the Neon Moon
    Tarot. I just love how cool this new deck is. It nails a consistent cyberpunk
    aesthetic and sticks to all the classic symbols.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s start by noticing some differences. The symbols above are all there, but
    instead of meandering near a cliff, she is about to step out of a tall building.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I love how this draws our attention to another interpretation. The Fool might
    need to take an intentional leap of faith to start the journey. The next part
    of your life might have a bit of a fall, but you must trust that something will
    catch you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another difference is that the dog isn’t physically here. He’s on a sign watching
    it all happen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s a reminder that your support and companion on this new beginning don’t
    have to be present for the journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep some sort of reminder that you have this support system around in case
    you need it, but don’t require the person to be present the whole time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Context matters a lot when reading the cards. Here are some particularly strong
    things to look out for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think the meaning should be clear in the past/present/future positions. It
    will indicate starting new or beginning a journey during those times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It should also make sense for given questions. Just remember that it can mean
    many things, and the art of tarot requires you to intuit which one from context.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, position 1 of the [Celtic Cross](https://craftofwicca.com/intermediate-tarot-more-complicated-spreads/)
    spread indicates the topic. The Fool means the topic is the new beginning you’ve
    embarked on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas position 2 indicates the problem. The Fool here would suggest an emotional
    meaning. The problem is your naivete or innocence or ignorance. It will lead to
    danger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Position 9 is your hopes and fears. The Fool would indicate that you fear the
    coming journey or that you hope for a new beginning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See how the position can dictate the reading? This will become even more important
    when you take into account what the rest of the cards have indicated to that point.
