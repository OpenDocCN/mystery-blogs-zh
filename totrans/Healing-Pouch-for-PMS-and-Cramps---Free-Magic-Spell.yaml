    using only positive language - so for instance, instead of writing ''I don't want
    to have period cramps'' write ''I want to be free of period cramps''.

    and write them down on a small slip of paper. Fold this slip three times to symbolize
    healing-three-fold and place it, along with the ribbon, the lavender, and the
    hematite, into the pouch. Carry the pouch around with you until the end of your
    period and then dismantle it, giving the slip back to the earth, and keeping the
    other items for use in further spell work.
