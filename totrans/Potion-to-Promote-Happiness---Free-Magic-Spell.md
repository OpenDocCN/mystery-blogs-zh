**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Milk

*   Cinnamon Stick (optional!)

*   Honey

 First, pour some milk into your favorite mug. Once you do that, place the mug in a microwave. Microwave the mug with the milk in it for forty seconds, or until it's heated up to the temperate you want.

Once it's finished microwaving, mix a teaspoon of honey into the milk. (You can add more or less if you so choose.) After that, pour in some cinnamon - there doesn't need to be a set amount. Just pour as much in as you want.

Optional: Add a cinnamon stick to the drink! It adds a nice aesthetic, which always makes me happy.
