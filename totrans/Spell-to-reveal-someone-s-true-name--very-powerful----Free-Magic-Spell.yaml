- en: For those of you who do not know a true name is a is a belief, so some might
    not believe in this at all. some believe this name or similar anyway is given
    to you by your mother at birth she will whisper it in your ear. other believe
    the gods bestowed a sacred name on you at birth, and others feel though many different
    methods one has a magickal name you can use when addressing the gods. so really
    it depends on your path. if it feels right to you, try asking your God/Goddess
    about the name, if they know it, or that you wish to be called by the name you've
    discovered. if it feels right to you use the name, but don't tell people if you
    feel it will give them power over you. this is meant to be a powerful name that
    gives you special strengths and others could use this to control your will. (this
    definition was provided by a user on this site called Nekoshema, however the spell
    and ritual was written by me, WitchofEarth)

- en: (this is my own words) In Egyptian mythology a true name is the name of the
    soul, this name is different for everyone. So your true name is different from
    anyone else's true name. For those who are wondering your true name won't be an
    actual name, such a Matthew or Sarah, it will be like a string of letters that
    form a ''word'' It is very important you are one hundred percent sure about how
    to pronounce someone's true name, for if a true name is pronounced incorrectly
    you could cause harm to the person or even potentially wipe them out of existence.
    Also this spell should only be used if you have a strong enough need to know someone's
    true name, this spell will still work even if you just want to know someone's
    true name without any justifiable reason. Needing to have a strong enough reason
    to know someone's true name is just a part of my own code of ethics. Also, if
    you speak someone's true name out loud even if that person who's true name you
    know can't even hear you. So if you were at home and they weren't anywhere nearby.
    Once that name is spoken you will gain power over the person. It will feel like
    something is being drawn to you instantly, it will happen the moment you speak
    their true name out loud. ((This spell was added on 3/17/17 at 3:28pm))

    by internet strangers. 2\. I am curious as to why it will not work. I trust you
    and I don't want to be seen as the type of person who says ''all spells work just
    u need belife'' but I would like to know why it won't work. [All misspelling intentional]

- en: Earth_Draco deleted his account a while ago, and I don't think he made another
    one, so I hope you don't mind if I try to answer. A person's true name is something
    certain practices believe in, but it's not universal. It's basically a secret
    name hidden from everyone, including yourself, that has your full power. You need
    to discover it yourself, and once you do, you should be extremely careful who
    you share it with as it's believed just knowing their true name can mean someone
    can control you. This spell won't work because it claims you simply say ''I want
    to know this person's true name'' and you get it. To learn your own true name
    can take years of soul searching. So, while a spell might exist to find someones
    true name, this is too simplistic to work [it's like saying you can blow up a
    planted by nodding, the exchange of energy isn't equal]
