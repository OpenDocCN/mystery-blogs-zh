    one who would definitely heed to your problems...but remember....he will take
    something from you in return...so only cast this spell when you are in extreme
    despair

- en: I got a laugh out of the notion ''if God is not helping, the devil will.'' You
    can work with Satan, but this is not how it is done. If you wish to use this in
    your ritual to become a satanist, I suppose you could, but I would convert from
    a place of love, not contempt. People work with Satan because they feel an affinity
    towards him, not because they are mad at God for not giving them stuff.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Exactly. People come to Satan (as some call him) because they find something
    in him that draws them in. They don't come because God did something bad to them.
    They come from love, not hate

- en: I doubt this'll actually work. I know, it says that it worked in the description,
    but tell me, is it not possible that descriptions can be faked? Also, people come
    to Satan because they find something in him they could not find in the Christian
    God. To actually be a Satanist, you have to come from love for Satan, not hate
    for the Christian God. Satan will likely not ask for something in return (offerings
    of fruits could work if you want to give him something) but he won't ask for headless
    humans. A few drops of blood could suffice too. All in all, don't try this spell
