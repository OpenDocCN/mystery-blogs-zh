    and it will help you with creating and performing spells and nothing else. while
    you need all of the requirements, total belief, focus and visualization are crucial
    to this spell and all others. do not allow doubt to take over your mind while
    you perform the spell.'

    people. it could be in the middle of a lake. a clearing in the woods. whatever
    suits you.

- en: 3\. you need a spot that is exactly three feet or more away from everything
    else except the ground. so no large rocks or logs or animal skulls in that area.
    stand there with your eyes closed. slowly start to relax yourself, but by bit.
    relax your shoulders, hands, legs, face etc. your spine should be straight, though,
    like it's holding up the rest of your limp body. you should have good posture
    and your neck shouldn't be loose. eyes still closed, visualize and feel a warm
    glow in your torso. do this until you can see and feel it clearly. then imagine
    it spreading through the rest of you. keep the sensation in your body. you shouldn't
    lose it when you stop focusing on it.

    rush, take your time. you must feel like you''re actually levitating. maybe you
    are! but keep your eyes shut or the spell will be ruined. wait until the floating
    feeling stops on its own. recite the following (it''s best not to do it as a prayer
    to your God but if you can''t avoid it or it feels wrong to not, go ahead):'
