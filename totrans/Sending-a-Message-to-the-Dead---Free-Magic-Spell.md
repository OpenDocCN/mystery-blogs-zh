 ## Casting Instructions for 'Sending a Message to the Dead'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 White candle

*   1 Black Candle

*   An item(s) representing the person you wish to send a message

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 White candle

*   1 Black Candle

*   An item(s) representing the person you wish to send a message

 Place the white candle on the left (this represents life, it represents you), in the middle the item(s) representing the person you wish to communicate with (this represents who your message is intended for, more specifically, it guides your message to the correct spirit. It can be a bag of herbs representing them, crystals, a photo, etc.) and on the right the black candle (which literally represents the person who passed, the dead).

Light the white candle and open the means of communication with the spirits by first calling on the deity of your path (th spirit or entity responsible for communication and/or the ability to communicate with the dead) to facilitate communication with the person who has passed.

Tell them you wish to honor this person with a message, ask for the message to be relayed to them or if permissible for them to listen in and thank the spirits/diety. Then crossing above the item(s), light the black candle with the white one and begin to speak to them. When you are done relaying your message, wish them well and say good bye.

Then announce to the deity/spirit facilitating the communication that you are have finished, thank them again. Then turn to blow out the black candle saying "As I blow out this candle, communication from the realm beyond is done. No unwanted spirits or entities may make contact."

Then proceed to blow out the white candle saying, "As I blow out this candle, I end the communication with the deities/gods/goddesses [Incert whoever you called upon] . Thank you for your aid and guidance."

After that, any ritual or spell for cleansing the space you performed this in is highly reccomended (to avoid leaving yourself and that space open to any unwanted spiritual vistors).
