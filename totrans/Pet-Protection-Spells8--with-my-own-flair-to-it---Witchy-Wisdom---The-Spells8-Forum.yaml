    to get a little worried. He loves his wet food and will come in from outside around
    the time we give the wet food to the cats so I took notice when he hadn’t come
    home.

    and hopeful, felt confident in my magic and the results I would yield, which was
    Savage coming home safely!

    third eye, each of my wrists, and on my heart. I took the Palo Santo and asked
    the plant spirit to bless my tools and myself with guidance, love and light.

    I was hoping to achieve. I held space for this until I felt ready to proceed.
    Now the meditation can be done however you like, I chose to do this as I was setting
    up all of my items and tools.

    out from each other. This space was used to put my piece of paper with Savage’s
    name on it.

    while letting the candles burn for a few minutes. I snuffed it out and cut the
    wick, putting the wick with the piece of paper. I took the glass of water and
    tossed the liquid out. I thanked the Strength card and put it back in the deck.
