    spell have to have time for their powers and wings to develop. Also, your wings
    are easily hideable so if you are going somewhere, you can hide them. But beware
    of the mysterious team called AWTOK!

- en: After drinking the water, act like a fairy. Make it look like you are one with
    the earth and the fairies will choose if you are good enough to become one of
    their tribe. When you go to bed tonight, think of fairies and then go to sleep.
    The fairies might wake you up and give you a bracelet that shrinks you and turns
    you into a fairy. If they don't, try again and they might give you the bracelet.
    Once you have the bracelet, bid the fairies goodbye and go back to sleep. In the
    morning, put on the bracelet and keep it on for 7 days to show the fairies you
    deserve that bracelet. After 7 days, keep the bracelet onand go outside. Call
    for the fairies and they will come out and they will tell you to say a specific
    spell. Once the spell is said, you will shrink down and turn you into a fairy.
    The fairies will give you a home and will give you a tour. Once done exploring,
    take the bracelet off and you will become human again. Go find the gem and give
    it to the fairies and they might give you one specific power that matches your
    ability. One gem= one power. Be blessed and message me for any unusual side effects!
