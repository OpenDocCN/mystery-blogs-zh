- en: Cast the spell on a Sunday during Pisces but make sure it’s close to the new
    moon. For the spell you need a green candle as well as altar decorations in the
    same color. If you don’t have a green candle, you can always replace it with a
    yellow one but the altar decorations must match the same color as the candle.

    essential oil, a sprig of lavender, a crystal of quartz, a green taper candle,
    a white altar candle, a bolline or burin. Start by adding three drops of sandalwood
    oil to the carrier oil then empower it by rolling the bottle in your palms.

- en: Light the white candle and meditate on how your life will be for you or whoever
    you’re doing the spell for, when their health improves. Inscribe number 3 on the
    green candle and anoint it with the charged oil. Draw the oil towards you if you’re
    casting the spell on your behalf and away from you if it’s for someone else.

    health. Next, light up the candle and repeat the following words.
