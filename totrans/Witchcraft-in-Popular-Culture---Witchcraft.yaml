- en: However, modern ideas of the witch are often simplified to the point of caricature,
    especially in media aimed at children (such as fairy tales). Witches are often
    stereotypically depicted as wicked old women with wrinkled skin and pointy hats,
    clothed in black or purple, with warts on their noses and sometimes long claw-like
    fingernails. They are often shown concocting [**potions**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/terms-potion/)
    out of frogs and lizard parts in large [**cauldrons**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/terms-cauldron/)
    or flying through the air on [**broomsticks**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/terms-besom/),
    frequently accompanied by black cats.

    connection. Much more rarely are witches depicted in a positive light or as essentially
    good, and still more rarely as practitioners of a religion or faith.
