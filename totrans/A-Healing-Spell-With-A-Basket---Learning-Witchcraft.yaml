- en: Do you know someone in ill health or low spirits? You can wish them well with
    this charmed basket. For the spell, you need a wicker basket with a handle, a
    flowerpot that fits into the basket, a suitable plant (especially one you have
    grown yourself), 3 spiral seashells, a piece of rose quartz and an amethyst crystal.

- en: You should choose a plant which is appropriate to your friend’s illness or condition.
    If the person is vaguely unwell, you could always rely on pimpernel and larkspur,
    especially if these plants have a good aroma. Place the shells, amethyst, rose
    quartz in a spot that catches the moonlight and leave them there for 7 nights
    before there’s a full moon to recharge with enough energy.

- en: The first morning after the full moon, plant the chosen plant and wash the leaves
    using dew. If the plant has long tendrils and leaves, you should weave them around
    the basket’s handle. Lay the recharged shells and stones from the moon on the
    soil and say the following words.
