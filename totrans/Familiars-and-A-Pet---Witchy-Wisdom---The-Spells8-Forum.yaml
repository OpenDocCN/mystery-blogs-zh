- en: Familiars and a Pet…NOT the same thing. Nor should you want your beloved pet
    to be your Familiar. For a modern witch to lay claim to a Familiar spirit, the
    animal must have made a pact with the witch. The animal Familiar is actually not
    an animal, but a spirit who takes the form of an animal (or other form) and typically
    this spirit will not reside in the witch’s home. They pretty much come and go
    as they please.

    will it to be the case, as if somehow they are a witch failure without one. When
    someone points out they actually don’t have a Familiar, all hell breaks loose!
    The endless social media threads of fighting begins. If you are a witch and practice
    witchcraft and don’t have a Familiar, that is quite fine. You have not failed
    at anything. If you want your pet to have a “cool-title”, I highly recommend NOT
    using the term ‘Familiar.’ Call it something else - there are thousands of words
    to pick from the English language! I hope when you are done reading this, you
    will understand WHY the term ‘Familiar’ should not be interchangeably used to
    describe your beloved pet.

- en: '**So what exactly is a Familiar and what does it represent?** Commonly found
    in animal form, a Familiar is a spiritual entity that aids a witch in their practice.
    These Familiar spirits could take on nearly any form, sometimes human likeness.
    Sometimes the Familiar was described as a grotesque creature of fantasy, a mixture
    or blend of several creatures all rolled into one thing.'

    , in Western demonology, small animal or imp kept as a [witch’s](https://www.britannica.com/topic/witch-occultism)
    attendant, given to her by the devil or inherited from another witch. The familiar
    was a low-ranking [demon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/demon-Greek-religion)
    that assumed any animal shape, such as a toad, dog, insect, or black cat. ([1](https://www.britannica.com/topic/familiar))'

- en: The Familiar was believed to subsist by sucking blood from a witch’s fingers
    or other protuberances on her body such as a mole or a wart. During the European
    witchcraft trials of the 15th–17th century a suspected witch was searched for
    the “teats” by which she fed her Familiar, and these, like the devil’s brand marks,
    were considered sure signs of her guilt. Alternatively, a witch may have fed her
    Familiar blood from sacrificed animals.

    the complicated relationship between the witch and Familiar. The Familiar didn’t
    just do what it was told. It also made requests of the witch, in exchange for
    its magical help (December 1995). Most of the time, the Familiar itself initiated
    the contact with the witch. It would choose a person to attach itself to, and
    that person rarely had any choice but to keep it and work along side it.'

    Essex woman accused of witchcraft admitted that she had three Familiars in the
    form of mice: Littleman, Prettyman and Daynty. Another had four mice named Prickeare,
    James, Robyn and Sparrow. Elizabeth Clark, was the first victim of Matthew Hopkins,
    England’s great witch-hunter of the 17th century, confessed to having five Familiars,
    including unearthly ones: Holt, a kitten; Jamara, a fat, leg- less spaniel; Sack
    and Sugar, a black rabbit; Newes, a pole- cat; and Vinegar Tom, a long-legged,
    greyhound-like creature with an ox’s head and broad eyes, which could turn itself
    into a headless four-year-old child. (well isn’t that pleasant!)([2](https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Witches-Witchcraft-Wicca/dp/0816071047/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1498197935&sr=8-5&keywords=encyclopedia+of+witchcraft&linkCode=sl1&tag=luxfer-20&linkId=2f01e5ab043e2db42d4ac06f567011c9))'

    as a magickal shield to protect your butt if you happened to piss off another
    witch. Familiar’s are tools, they are entities that work with you magickally and
    magick isn’t always rainbows and unicorns. Magick can be ugly. In no way, shape,
    or form, should you WANT your beloved pet to take on this role.

    that was masquerading as a normal animal to ‘blend in’ and could be used as a
    magickal shield to protect you.

- en: '**So what exactly is a Pet?** Honestly this should not even need to be explained,
    but here we go! An animal, not of spirit form. A living being you care for by
    feeding it, cleaning it, providing medical care when needed, loving it, playing
    with it, and general maintenance of it. Typically this animal is loved dearly
    by the family, and is never wished ill upon. You don’t want any harm coming to
    your pet, this is why most humans, take their pets to the vet and spend thousands
    of dollars in treating their ailments, and spend hundreds of dollars spoiling
    them with toys, treats, etc.'

    or otherwise. Now mind you, a pet can certainly take interest in your magickal
    workings. Because you love and care for them, they may just want to be with you
    and act as a comforting presence. This is no way means they are magickal entities.
    All it means is, they like your company and want to see what you are up to.

    Period. Our pets love us with no strings attached. No conditions. They love us
    unconditionally. They would probably be around you whether you are casting a spell,
    reading a book, or laying down in bed. Even if you are allowing them to practice
    in your craft with you, does not make them a Familiar. Pets are REAL, living creatures
    that just want your love and attention. They have ZERO clue what a spell is or
    what magick is.
