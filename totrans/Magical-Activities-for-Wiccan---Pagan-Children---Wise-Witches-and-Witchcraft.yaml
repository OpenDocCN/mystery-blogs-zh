    just as any other mom or dad does. When it comes to spirituality finding fun,
    engaging activities that reflect our values can be challenging. This is especially
    true if you choose a non-dogmatic, more organic approach to sharing magical ideas
    and approaches to life.

    after a family pet or another animal that the child sees and experiences regularly.
    You can take some time to gather the symbolic information about the chosen creature
    beforehand, then begin a game of “pretend you’re a . . .” with younger children.
    As they mimic the animal, ask them how they feel, what they think it would be
    like to live as that animal, and so forth. Add whatever insights you can that
    you feel the child will understand.

    than before and can be told outright the purpose of such games. In this case,
    let them choose any animal they want to mimic and read up on it in a children’s
    encyclopedia or on the computer. Do some breathing exercises with them before
    they start the mime, and then see what develops. Don’t forget to ask questions
    and talk about the experience afterwards, so it has a greater impact.

    to serve the planet. In Wicca and Paganism, reciprocity with nature is nothing
    less than essential, and that includes cleaning up human messes. Since children
    are always looking for a good excuse to go outside and play, you can encourage
    them to give part of their playtime to clean-up projects.

    people’s lawns. Before heading to play with friends, your child could pick these
    up. For safety reasons show them what they SHOULD NOT touch, and also give them
    gloves, thereby avoiding some nasty germs. You can also show your child how to
    prepare recycling containers for pickup by the authorities. True, these are small
    efforts, but every little bit helps.
  prefs: []

    awareness days, and paper drives (this last effort can raise money for schools
    or ecological protection groups). Or, try holding a contest for neighborhood children
    to see who can come up with the most creative way of recycling something (break
    this up by age group). Many businesspeople are happy to contribute small prizes
    for these kinds of things. Better still, this gets the tribe of your community

    find a feather from a particular bird (if it’s identifiable), use the opportunity

    to not only give thanks and make requests for others in their prayers, but to
    also place petitions before the Sacred for themselves, and to talk to Spirit about

    to you about something, they should leave the staff in a special spot. This acts
    as a silent signal between the two of you, to which you can respond quickly. Sometimes
    symbols are easier than words for opening that discussion.

    Think back to your own childhood. What kinds of things did you enjoy doing outdoors?
    Did you weave flowers into caplets, wheat or corn into braids, or have leaf-raking
    parties? Believe it or not, your children will likely enjoy similar things, to
    which you can add a magical dimension. Look at each moment of living as an opportunity
    to teach basic spiritual concepts through recognition, joyfulness, thankfulness,
    and love.
