    can you give me advice on were I should start

- en: Start with a good beginners guide which explains what Magik is, what witchcraft
    is, and how to work with energy. The Basics is energy work, specifically charging,
    grounding, shielding and psi balls, meditation and visualization. You do not need
    to be a master at these skills, but having the ability to feel the flow of Magikal
    energy and being able to focus on a desired outcome are key to spell casting.
    I am aware not every can visualize, and for some meditation is impossible. However,
    this is where your personal experience comes in. Meditation is a way to be present.
    You do not shut off your brain. What brings you to the here and now? Visualization
    might be writing, drawing, singing or looking at a photo. How do you utilize your
    imagination? If you are wanting to walk a pagan path, be it Wicca, Heathen, or
    traditional witchcraft, you will need to research. If possible, find a reputable
    beginners guide for the path you wish to follow and read it. You could also use
    YouTube, TikTok, Podcasts and other free technology to help you. The problem is
    the contradictory information. Do you have a path in mind? I could help recommend
    resources. If you are interested in working with fairys, I suggest you begin with
    ancient lore and legends. If you can find folklorist they can help you get an
    idea of who the fair folk are and what they are like. Modern examples of the fae
    are typically cute little people with butterfly wings. I can guarantee you, 99%
    of fairys are not like that. They can be sweet, they can also be spiteful. They
    also have their own norms and ethics which could be seen as cruel by humans. Be
    respectful and do not assume they are there to help you. Never say thank you and
    never give them your name. Saying thank you indicates you owe them, and giving
    them your name gives them power over you.
