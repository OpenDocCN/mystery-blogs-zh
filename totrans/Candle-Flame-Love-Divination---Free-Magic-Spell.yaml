    size, colour, movement, even the smoke can be used to decipher an answer to any
    question.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I suggest doing a google image search of specific candle flames. You should
    find guides to fire divination which would include more detail and photos. In
    answer to your question, a rising flame would be your average candle flame. It's
    steady, not too big or small but strong and bright. A falling flame is a tiny
    flame like when a candle is about to burn out.
