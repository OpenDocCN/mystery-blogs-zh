# The Black Dot of Vengeance

Warning this spell is not to be used unless you are entirely sure that you wish to use it. This spell has harmful effects to those who cast it and use it on your enemies. In old Legend in the days of the Pirate If someone was given the black dot that was be Sac-religious and This was a great Disrespect but as always a legend can be true...This is a secret passed down from 1000 years and forgotten, This may be the first spell to surface in over a long time.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'The Black Dot of Vengeance'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*    1: Sheet of paper from the bible that contains The Father of Darkness's Name

*    2: Black Paint

*    3: Thy Enemies Name

*    1 One Candle Black

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*    1: Sheet of paper from the bible that contains The Father of Darkness's Name

*    2: Black Paint

*    3: Thy Enemies Name

*    1 One Candle Black

First Take the sheet of Paper and write your enemies name onto it, After you have done so then paint a black dot onto a piece of paper and chant the following after lighting your candle.

''_____ I call down the Wrath of hell upon you. By this Blasphemy, I curse you ___ In the name of the Evil. I curse you In the name of all that is unholy. I DAMN THEE FOR BETRAYING ME I DAMN THEE FOR DISGRACING ME I DAMN THEE FOR ALL THE PAIN THOU HATH CAUSED ME, SO SHALL MY WILL BE DONE! AND SO MOTE IT BE!''

Blow the candle out and pour a small drop onto the middle of the black dot. Go and find your Enemies and give this paper to. Then Wrath shall befall them or place it under their bed and until it is removed or burned. Then they will suffer... so pretty much no one is going to know to burn it. Therefore, take heed to this warning. I suggest that you let them take it, then take it back and burn it after all is done and thy desire hath been met.
