    life before you - so honor and respect his/her previous experiences as being an
    integral part of him/her. Rather than focusing on the ex and feeling insecure
    do this ritual.

    you burn the candle and oil. This can be more of a ritual over a ''say these words
    and things are okay'' type of spell. They said you can repeat this as needed,
    but if you require a spell to overcome emotions surrounding the past, you require
    more than a quick spell. You require shadow work. Meditate on your emotions, let
    them come up, without judgement, then flow past. Journaling about them as you
    meditate can help you process and release these emotions. After each time you
    pause to reflect and journal, say the chant again and return to your meditation.
    Once you have a calm feeling, like a sigh of relief or a weight has been lifted,
    you can end the session. Things we resist, persist. You will need to work through
    these feelings in some way, and while this spell can help, depending on how strong
    these emotions are, you might need to dive deeper into your subconscious.
