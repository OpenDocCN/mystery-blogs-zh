    colors. Make yourself child-appropriate unless you are in FNAF 3 or 4, make yourself

- en: No, that is not how Real Magik works. FNAF is a work of fiction, Magik does
    not defy nature, ergo you cannot bring a fictional being into the physical world.

- en: Eating food that can affect your dreams and playing the game right before bed
    can indeed cause you to dream about it. I would not call it a spell exactly, but
    if you are focused on the intention to dream about FNAF, fine, it is a spell.
