- en: I would edit this slightly, like add herbs and crystals sacred to Dragons, or
    for specific things like protection or strength. I would get into the tub and
    say the chant and perhaps meditate for a bit [i would also use candles or have
    no lights on] but I wouldn't take an actual bath. It's like a baptism, they're
    pouring holy water on you, not washing your hair, so show a little respect for
    the Dragons you are calling on.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it was done mindfully and with purpose, I imagine it would be just as valid
    to shower. You would just need to adapt your visualizations around the idea of
    being bathed in moving water. Maybe focus on the idea of the power of the dragons
    infusing the water and washing away negativity and weakness to let it literally
    run down the drain.

- en: Be careful the water is not too hot. This sounds plausible, but if this is the
    first thing you do with dragons, I would edit it. It comes off as you want to
    be given a bunch of abilities with nothing in return. Spiritual beings can bless
    us, but only after we build a relationship with them and it would be a gift from
    them, not a reward for you.
