    look up binaural beats on youtube, these music¬†video's contain brainwaves and
    can really help you to concentrate, I reccomend using the Alpha Brainwaves)

    cleared your mind Imagine the ones you want to protect being engulfed in a thin
    layer of protective energy as you recite the following prayer to call for the
    aid of dragons (remember to speak in a clear but respectfull and most of all calm
    voice, Dragons do not like to be commanded, and they prefer a calm mind.)

    is a story about what happened to me in real life....and also I would never write
    something like roleplay on a website that does not permit roleplaying.....because
    I am one of those people that DO still read the rules. Have a nice day
  prefs: []

- en: A story of what happened to you in real life? It is a spell you made up that
    you claim works for you. Reading it over, coupled with my base level knowledge
    of both Latin and dragons leads me to conclude you either made the whole thing
    up, or you feel it worked for you. I have no doubt you can send out the intention
    to protect your loved ones since many spells work that way, but calling on dragons
    and using a specific brainwave while reciting something you typed into Google
    translate will not work for the majority of people because it is not a real spell.
    You could improve it, but as written, it is not real.

- en: Certainly not a bad process for a quick working. Simple concept, clean and easy
    to do, and overall I think this is in effect a nice way to offer a prayer of safety
    and protection. I fail to see any role-playing in this. ... unless something has
    been edited out since it was first published. Personally , I prefer to just use
    plain English when doing a working... though that is just a preference as I am
    a bit too lazy to be learning new languages. To me this is perfectly sound in
    regards to the philosophies behind magic and energy working.

- en: Seems plausible, but I doubt Latin is required [you need to understand what
    your saying or your words won't have power] Dragon's understand what you're saying
    regardless of language, so I would go with the English translation.

- en: Nekoshema is definitely knowledgeable when it comes to draconic energies in
    magick so I'll trust that this is plausible, but I definitely agree that there's
    no reason to use Latin. Also, I'm certainly not a Latin expert, but I took it
    for a year, and the Latin in this is not correct, both with incorrect words and
    huge grammatical errors, and was very obviously put into google translate (which
    is very bad at translating Latin). If you're going to post a spell it might be
    best to use languages you have some knowledge in.
  prefs: []

- en: Edit attempted. Thank you for the English translation or if not the exact translation,
    alternative words for the spells purpose or intent. I personally would not use
    the Latin. As chance for mispronunciation is very high.
