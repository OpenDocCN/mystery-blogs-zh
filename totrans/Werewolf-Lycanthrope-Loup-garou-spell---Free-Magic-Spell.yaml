    in magic for it to work. It is NOT like in the movies obviously though. But you
    will have a better sense of smell,sight and hearing.

    THANK YOU. This spell is to help you more so connect with your inner wolf, you
    will have a better sense of smell, better sight, wolf instincts, etc. It will
    not transform you into a wolf itself, that would be shape shifting. Which this
    spell IS NOT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Excessive use of capslock is against site rules [as is roleplaying because this
    spell is giving the impression it will cause physical transformation] also, it's
    been a while since I studied loup-garou, but they transform by wearing a magical
    wolf pelt which is past down through the family. No spell or bite from another
    werewolf required.

- en: Describing your spell, you claim it will heighten sense, which Real Magik cannot
    do. As for the spell itself, nowhere did you claim this was mental shifting. You
    encouraged people to design their dream wolf fursona then say a chant which includes
    the line ''we are further transformed into cunning beasts.'' You go on to include
    changing eye colour and teeth. At the bottom, you claim it should work overnight
    but might take a few days then list a plethora of side effects which would not
    happen if this was meant to be mental shifting. This spell is fake, you cannot
    physically transform with Real Magik. This includes eye colour and better senses.

    violation [spamming comments, harassment comments, using banned language, excessive
    use of all caps. These are rules only you seem to have violated] You simply ignore
    and/or block the person if they're mailing you. If they're mailing you or harassing
    you on other parts of the site, report them to a mod. If your ''go away'' is directed
    at me, I'm not harassing you [I think this is the second time I've commented on
    one of your spells, but don't quote me because I genuinely don't remember you]
    I tend to keep an eye on the comments section for questions or inappropriate comments.
    So, I assure you, I'm not after you. If this is a threat to Tadashi, he treats
    everyone equally. He worked through the fantasy spells 4 years ago [his comment
    was from 2019] so he probably just comment on a random spell without checking
    the user.
