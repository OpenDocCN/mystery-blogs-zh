**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Five white candles around a pentagram

*   Strong imagination

 Go into a quiet warm space.
Light all the candles in the penta gram and focus on the flame.
Focus on the way it moves freely and warm.
Focus on the feeling of strength and warmth in your heart.
Visualize that the candle touches you with the flame.
Picture the fire lighting up and burning.
Your entire body.
Now picture as it stops burning all the ash fall to the ground.
Now you are purée with the light.
And warmth of the flame as you now are one with it.
