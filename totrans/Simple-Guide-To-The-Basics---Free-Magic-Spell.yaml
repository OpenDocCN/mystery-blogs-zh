- en: As you mature and gain more experience, these things will become second nature.
    Although you may not necessarily use every single one, they are important and
    good to know because they are like stepping stones towards more serious practice.
    It usually takes at least a year or so to master all of them. Don't be disapointed
    or discouraged if it takes longer. If really want to learn this, then practice!

    present. While the stereotypical cross-legged monk meditation is the common view,
    and very useful, there are a plethora of other options. Walking meditations are
    another one. You could listen to a walking meditation track as you walk, or simply
    observe the world around you and listen to what you can hear. Sitting outside
    with your morning brew is another form of meditation. Guided meditations or meditation
    music can be utilized if you struggle to focus. The key to meditation is to let
    thoughts flow by without clinging to them. You should also be consistent with
    this practice. Try meditating every day at the same time for a week utilizing
    one of the methods and record how you feel before and after each session, then
    compare how you felt at the beginning of the week and the end of the week.'

    image in their head. Yes, this takes practice, so do not write it off as something
    you cannot do if you are out of practice. Start with something simple, like a
    red dot, then a red ball. Slowly, flesh out the image to you throwing the ball.
    Not everyone is visual, however, so use something that works for you. If certain
    music gives you a particular image in your mind, listen to that song. If you prefer
    writing or painting, create the image you wish to achieve. Visualization is important
    in Magik because it tells the energy what you wish to achieve. You think about
    how rich and successful you are while casting a wealth spell. Without doing that,
    the energy will not know if your vision of success is working a stressful job
    or your dream job.

- en: Energy work, it is the ability to tap into and manipulate Magikal energy. This
    is how you cast spells. You need to charge energy into your body, use visualization
    to give it a specific vibrational charge, then direct it on a specific course.
    Charging, grounding, centering, shielding and psi balls are the basic building
    blocks of energy work. Circle casting is not ordinarily considered a form of energy
    work, but it is. You are creating a protective barrier and transforming the area
    within the circle to a Magikal state. There are many ways to cast a circle, but
    the basic premise is to focus energy, and walk around a circle in a clockwise
    motion as you direct this energy from you into the ground and create a sphere
    that goes above and below you to protect you. When you are finished, you would
    repeat the process in the opposite order, walking counter-clockwise and calling
    the energy back.

- en: Correspondences are commonly utilized associations with an object. Colour correspondences
    refer the frequency the energy vibrates at. If you want a love spell, red is viewed
    as passion, while pink is romance. However, personal feelings toward an item can
    altar the energy the item possesses. So, while you can use correspondences to
    find ingredients that share a similar energy to the spell you wish to cast, if
    you do not resonate with an item, do not use it. If lavender turns your stomach,
    do not use it in a calming spell. If you love nutmeg, adding a pinch to your spells
    would personalize it to you.
