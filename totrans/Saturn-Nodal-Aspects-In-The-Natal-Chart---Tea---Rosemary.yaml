- en: In the natal chart, the North Node represents all things unknown. Unike the
    South Node, which is familiar, we’ve never learned the North Node lessons before,
    so moving towards the North Node can feel uncomfortable.
  prefs: []

    It’s easy to see that these two energies don’t play well together!

- en: Saturn is a large, important planet that influences your birth chart in a huge
    way, so Saturn-Nodal aspects are incredibly important. Saturn can give us the
    power to manifest the life we desire, but it can also bestow painful lessons that
    ultimately help us grow.
  prefs: []

    push you towards your North Node and your future self.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn conjunct North Node suggests that this life will feel very “Saturnian”
    with a lot of hard lessons to learn. You’ll have to deal with quite a lot of baggage
    on your journey to your North Node.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need to learn maturity and self-reliance with this aspect. Saturn conjunct
    North Node indicates a dependence on others in past lifetimes, so this lifetime
    you are forced to “go it alone” in some way. This can feel uncomfortable but will
    force you to grow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may be hard to see the *good* in your journey to the North Node. You consistently
    feel *different* from others and “hung out to dry,” so you might start to see
    Saturn conjunct North Node as a bad thing. However, all of the difficult lessons
    you encounter are necessary in order for you to achieve true independence and
    mastery of self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'With Saturn conjunct North Node (and therefore opposite South Node), you may
    hold on to the past far too much. You try to tell yourself that this isn’t emotional
    but is simply logical and that your past ways of doing things are best. You might
    even think that you don’t have or express emotions as much as others. However,
    you’re lying to yourself here: this *is* an emotional wound that makes you want
    to stick with what you know.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn conjunct North Node often means that it’s necessary for you to change
    your views and your way of thinking. You must forge ahead and create a new mental
    construct. This will be difficult because you’re stuck in your old ways, but it
    is also necessary. Until you can let go of your past beliefs and embrace new beliefs
    that better serve you, you’ll experience the “pain” of Saturn over and over. You
    can choose when to transmute this aspect by changing the way you think!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect concerns *letting go*. You must release your past beliefs and even
    your past self in order to become who you’re meant to be. This is a really tough
    journey. Much of this work will happen before your first Saturn return (around
    age 28) so you may experience pain quite young.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t let this aspect get you down. Even though Saturn conjunct North Node can
    feel a bit depressing, try to remember that everything is happening for your own
    good. You will come out the other side a stronger and braver person!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are probably ambitious and driven with Saturn conjunct North Node. Your
    goals are very important to you. However, this “end result” might end up looking
    different than you pictured. Don’t be alarmed if your goals shift and morph as
    you change your mental patterns and views.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may encounter teachers, mentors, or even parents in your life who push you
    towards your North Node and teach you how to achieve your goals. However, never
    forget that you must maintain your sense of independence and ultimately figure
    it out yourself. Otherwise, Saturn will hit you where it hurts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over and over, you will want other people to solve problems for you. It’s your
    instinct to rely on others. But you’ll find that this method never works for you,
    at least not in this lifetime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learn to take personal responsibility for yourself *and* for your journey to
    your North Node in this lifetime. No one will show you the perfectly illuminated
    path. This is something you must find yourself; by doing this, you will *also* realize
    the immense strength that you have inside.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Saturn conjunct North Node can be a bit of a lonely placement, it’s necessary
    to understand that you don’t *need* others to accomplish anything. Focus on working
    towards your goals and you’ll develop friendships that don’t revolve around this
    placement more easily.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn trine North Node aspect indicates that you’re here to live a very
    serious lifetime. Your lessons will focus on accountability, responsibility, and
    stability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need to learn a lot of your lessons by yourself and take complete responsibility
    for yourself. Luckily, these lessons aren’t totally foreign to you. In fact, you
    already have this sense of individuality because you’ve learned some of this in
    a past lifetime. Now, you can put these skills to good use with your current lessons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This Saturn trine North Node aspect indicates that you may not like to be rushed.
    You know that *slow and steady wins the race* and this is how you live your life.
    You probably make progress best when you’re working on your own, at your own pace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a beneficial placement, though it isn’t very exciting. Saturn trine
    North Node gives you a sense of stability as you learn your lessons. You’ll find
    that your lessons in this lifetime feel somewhat familiar, so it’s easier to push
    towards those North Node qualities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the Saturn trine North Node aspect can *also* suggest that you have
    burdens in your life that push you towards your North Node, particularly burdens
    surrounding responsibility. You may be the “responsible” one in your family or
    may need to become a caretaker for someone else. While these roles don’t feel
    totally foreign to you, they may feel limiting or heavy.
  prefs: []

    Everything that happens here is for a reason!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn sextile North Node aspect indicates that you learn your North Node
    lessons at a slow and steady pace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also means that you have lessons in responsibility in this lifetime. With
    Saturn sextile North Node, you have the *opportunity* to learn how to take responsibility
    for yourself. Should you choose to learn this lesson, you’ll find that you’re
    quickly moved towards your soul’s purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a lot happier. This might be foreign to you but will enhance your life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bear in mind that you may *also* have the Saturn trine South Node aspect (though
    not always). This aspect is all about burdens. You may feel burdened by the emotions
    of other people, the financial situations of others, etc. Typically, this aspect
    indicates that many of the burdens you bear are not your own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important with the Saturn sextile North Node aspect that you *shed your
    burdens* but embrace personal responsibility. This means learning *not* to take
    on the burdens of others but to take responsibility for your *own* emotions and
    actions. Release any codependency but still treat others with respect. Learn to
    stick up for yourself and say what you mean without playing games.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect pushes you to be very clear with others. You probably have a tendency
    to deal with the burdens thrust upon you, but then your own emotions come out
    sideways, so you end up hurting yourself and others. In this lifetime, you must
    learn *not* to accept burdens that are not your own and instead take responsibility
    through *owning* your feelings.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn opposition North Node aspect (which goes along with the Saturn conjunct
    South Node aspect) indicates that the energy of Saturn is working *against* your
    soul’s lesson in this lifetime. You must release and heal from your past before
    you can truly move forward towards your North Node.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you don’t want to forget the lessons you’ve learned with Saturn conjunct
    South Node. These lessons were all about responsibility and authority, and these
    are important traits. However, these ideas may have become too extreme in your
    life. For example, you may be too focused on social status or societal authority
    to the point where you are not free to be different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the Saturn conjunct South Node aspect, you must also overcome your fear
    of failure. You tend to fear change because it’s unknown (meaning you can fail),
    but you don’t see that the true failure is not *trying* at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect indicates a deep sense of inadequacy. However, you need to go backward
    (into the South Node) to heal before you can move forwards. Don’t run from these
    feelings – they never truly leave until you actually deal with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn conjunct South Node, you may seem mature in a societal way, yet
    you shy away from achieving emotional or spiritual maturity. You are bound to
    old methods and mindsets. Specifically in the house where this conjunction sits,
    your old ways of thinking keep you prisoner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect often stems from childhood. Through various types of trauma, you
    developed a very rigid worldview. This served you as a survival technique then
    but no longer serves you now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn opposition North Node will force you to work through these issues. You’ll
    find that you *never* achieve success when you adhere to your old ways of thinking.
    You must let go of the responsibility you feel to be “right” or “correct.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this aspect, it’s time to find a new way of thinking, even if it feels
    taboo. You must shed your old beliefs and find what *you* think deep in your soul.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn opposition North Node *does* indicate that you can use the positive qualities
    of Saturn (responsibility, organization, boundaries, discipline, hard work) to
    move towards your North Node. However, you must find these qualities in yourself
    and utilize them to develop a new set of beliefs instead of simply modeling yourself
    after these qualities in order to achieve societal acceptance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be a scary aspect because it requires a journey into the darkest parts
    of the soul. Many people choose to ignore this work and never move towards their
    North Node because Saturn holds them back. Try to remember that the pain of dealing
    with the fact that your old belief system is no longer accurate is much briefer
    than pretending. In fact, once you work through Saturn opposition North Node,
    you will feel an immense sense of freedom and will have absolutely no limits for
    what you can achieve.

    Node.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect indicates that you take on self-inflicted burdens. You probably
    feel that you *must* take responsibility for other people in some way, but this
    is just a societal belief.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also want desperately to be accepted by society in a specific way (look
    to the houses of these points). In past lives or in childhood, you felt rejected,
    and now you seek the respect you believe you are missing. Still, you cannot get
    the respect you so desperately want. Your path isn’t to be seen by others in this
    lifetime, at least not in the way you initially *want*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn square North Node, you naturally have a lot of discipline. However,
    you could find that you use this discipline for societal gains and recognition
    instead of working towards the highest version of yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing discipline requires you to follow your own path, in a way that feels
    right to you, and in a way that moves you towards your Nodes. Anything else (for
    an ulterior motive) will backfire. You have a lot of natural discipline but you
    must apply it correctly to see results. Otherwise, if you use your discipline
    to try and get societal recognition, you’ll waste a *lot* of time for very little
    results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your discipline should focus primarily on healing your painful past. While you
    ignore the truths you don’t want to look at using society’s constructs as a shield,
    Saturn asks you to face them and be courageous. This is how you will achieve real
    success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn square North Node, you will also need to realize that your burdens
    are self-inflicted and figure out a way to let them dissipate. You will need to
    stand up for yourself and take responsibility for your own life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have healed your past trauma, you can then push towards your North
    Node without pain. Many Saturn square North Node people are *very* successful,
    but they will need to first work through some of their issues before this success
    can manifest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Saturn square North Node also indicates father issues. Your path
    (to your North Node) requires you to break free from your father and be different
    than he was in some way. This also requires that you deal with any trauma surrounding
    your father so that you can do this.
