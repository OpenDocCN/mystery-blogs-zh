- en: Take the almond oil, and pour it into the mixing bottle. Take three drops of
    peppermint oil or water, and add that to the mixing bottle as well. Light the
    white candle, and focus on why you’re casting the spell in the first place.

- en: Once you’ve got a solid idea in your mind, roll the bottle between your hands. Hold
    your hands prayer style as you do so, charging it with your thoughts and gratitude.
    Once you’ve got it ready, place it on the altar. Grab the indigo candle and carve
    the number 1 into it, though as per usual if you have a symbol you feel is more
    appropriate, use that. Anoint the candle with the oil mixture, return it to the
    holder, and then light it up.
