- en: How many times have you been asked out on a date? If the answer is not very
    many, which is probably the case as Wiccans are known to be solitary people, then
    you probably get nervous during those first dates that you go on, which can cause
    problems for getting a second date. First date jitters can cause you to stutter
    over the simplest words, be unable to perform the simplest tasks properly. And
    make you knock things over. If you are one of those people who literally freeze
    up in a nerve wracking situation, the awkward silences can be what get you. That
    is where a confidence charm comes into play. However, any confidence charm could
    cause issues, as some may cause you to talk too much, to boast a lot, or to become
    obnoxious almost. So you need one that is geared towards a first date. That is
    where this charm comes into play. You don't need anything special, as this is
    just a simple charm. However, if you feel you need a little boost, you can smell
    some crushed borage to give you a confidence boost on top of the charm. Only for
    a short second though, because too much will become overbearing. This charm is
    not permanent, so you want to do it, just before your date, and if the date goes
    on for more than an hour, then you may want to reapply so to speak. If you are
    not ready to let your date in on your Wiccan secret, excuse yourself to the restroom,
    and you can do it in the mirror there.
