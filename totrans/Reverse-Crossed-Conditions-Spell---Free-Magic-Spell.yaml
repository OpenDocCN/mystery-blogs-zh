    jinx onto them, burn a black candle on their name (putting their name on a paper
    beneath an overturned saucer under the candle) or carve their name on the candle.
    If you don't know the name of the person who did this trick to you, carve the
    words "**My Enemy**" on the candle. Any black candle will do, but if you use a
    black candle in the figure of the Devil, carve their name on it, and dress it
    with Cast Off Evil Oil, things will go harder with them. Burn the black candle
    on the toilet tank, a little bit each night, pinching it out between burnings.
    Burn it while the moon is growing smaller. Then, on the dark of the moon, the
    darkest night of the month, turn the burning black candle upside down and Extinguish
    it in the toilet bowl, saying;
