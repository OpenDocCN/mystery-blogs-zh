    a card for each week of the month, reviewing at the end of each week or month
    how the card's message played out. This method provides a more granular view of
    the month's energies and helps you stay attuned to the ebb and flow of life.

    for each month**. The first card represents the theme or energy of the month.
    The second card offers guidance on what to focus on. The third card provides advice
    on how to overcome any obstacles that may arise. The fourth card highlights potential
    challenges or obstacles. And finally, the fifth card indicates what needs to be
    released from the previous month.
