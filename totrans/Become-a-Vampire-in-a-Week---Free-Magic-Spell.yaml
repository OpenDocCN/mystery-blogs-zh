    not work.

- en: Try to use the red candle sometimes its better to have the candle because.fire
    of the flame, air to feed it, melted wax for water, and solid wax for earth. Candles
    represent all elements. Also it does work you shouldn't listen to nonbelievers.
    I'll do it and I'll tell you how it goes. Also you needs lots of faith in this
    type of magic and remeber this kinda magick comes with a cost. So think twice
    before doing a spell like this.
