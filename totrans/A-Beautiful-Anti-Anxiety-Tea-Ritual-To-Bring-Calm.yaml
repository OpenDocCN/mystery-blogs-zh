    for a way to soothe the anxiety that‚Äôs making your life more difficult. I know
    how you feel! As a fellow anxious person, I am well versed the brain loops of
    self-doubt, criticism and internal conversations that can be, quite frankly, debilitating.
    Today I want to share a magickal anti-anxiety tea ritual with you which can help
    calm those racing thoughts.

    [spell to help fight anxiety](https://wiccanow.com/our-anxiety-spell-to-banish-fear-and-stress/)
    and this post about all the best [magickal anti-anxiety herbs](https://wiccanow.com/9-herbs-for-anxiety/).
    Amethyst also shared a post about the best [crystals for helping reduce anxiety](https://wiccanow.com/crystals-for-anxiety/).

    in this anti-anxiety tea ritual, be sure to check out the post on herbs and crystals!

    normally. I realise that my ability to work at this point is completely compromised
    and that I need to take the time to calm my racing brain. I try to use the 30
    minutes or so that I allocate myself to complete this ritual to be mindful and
    kind to myself.

    enough without making yourself more anxious because you feel time pressure to
    complete a ritual.

    to call love to me because when I‚Äôm feeling anxious I need all the love I can
    get and hibiscus reminds me to love and like myself. You can omit this step completely
    if you want or you can use something like tonka bean to draw sweetness or [rosemary](https://wiccanow.com/learn-about-the-magical-properties-of-rosemary/)
    to dispel negativity and anxiety.

    the whole ritual if you don‚Äôt want to, but pre-make a little of the tea and drink
    it whenever you feel the need! It helps that it‚Äôs super delicious üôÇ
