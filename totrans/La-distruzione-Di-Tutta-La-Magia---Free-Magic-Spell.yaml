    Surround yourself with each candle and light them. Now on your alter with the
    paper use the brush to write in blood, ''Benedico questo giorno per essere la
    distruzione di tutta la magia.'' Then sign it with your signature at the bottum.
    Sign it with all your emotions, wishes, and dreams.

    probably won't work] You can work blood magick, but this isn't it. You can use
    a few drops of your own blood to strengthen a spell. Some even use animal sacrifices
    in their craft [research it please, don't start hunting animals and killing them.
    Most modern Pagans don't use animal sacrifices, and the ones that do treat the
    animals with the utmost respect] This spell is to make a wish? There are a ton
    of better options [write your wish on a bay leaf, charge the leave with energy
    while imagining your wish coming true, then burn it. Simple and effective wish
    spell. IF you wish to incorporate blood, prick your finger with a sterilized needle
    and let one drop fall on the leaf]
