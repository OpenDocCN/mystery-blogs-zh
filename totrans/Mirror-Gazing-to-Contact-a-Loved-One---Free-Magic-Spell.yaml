- en: Below is Raymond Moody's mirror-gazing method. You can find the link to his
    book at the bottom of the page. Dr. Moody's patients have had great success using
    his mirror gazing method to communicate with departed loved ones and find healing
    for their grief. Dr. Moody got the idea for this from the psychomanteums that
    the ancient Greeks used. He built his own psychomanteum and allows people to use
    it to visit with their loved ones who have passed over. He gives instructions
    in his book for how to built your own psychomanteum so you can mirror-gaze in
    the privacy of your own home. The book gives more detail on the technique. I've
    written a basic outline of it here for you.

- en: This should be done in a dark and quiet room. Use a fan or a white noise device
    to block outside noises (ear plugs may also work). The lack of light and noise
    assists you in achieving a deeper meditative state while making it less likely
    that you'll be startled out of your trance by outside noises.

- en: Set up a large mirror with a place for you to sit, either in the floor or on
    a chair. You should be seated so that you can see into the mirror, but not see
    your own reflection. So sit at an angle to the mirror.

- en: Place a lit candle behind you. It will provide indirect light. You shouldn't
    be able to see the candle flame. It's meant to put out a very dim light in the
    room.

    them around you close enough to touch them from your seated position in front
    of the mirror.

- en: Sit quietly in front of the mirror and hold one of the items that remind you
    of your loved one. Think about your loved one and mentally ask them to come and
    communicate with you.

- en: You may close your eyes or look away from the mirror as you take some time to
    relax. Breathe deeply. An easy way to relax is to breathe in to the slow count
    of five, hold the breath for five seconds, then breathe out very slowly to the
    count of five. After you do this several times you will notice that you are very
    relaxed.

- en: With unfocused eyes, gaze into the mirror. You will eventually begin to see
    the mirror clouding over. Try not to focus on the cloudy shapes that pass by.
    Just let them pass and keep staring off into the space, into the mirror.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Continue gazing at the clouded mirror as you reach out and touch the other items
    around you and/or connect with the energy of the item in your hand. If you have
    a piece of fabric or a cologne bottle that smells like your loved one, pick it
    up and smell it as you continue gazing.

- en: If you are in a deep enough trance state, you will eventually begin to see the
    clouds taking the form of a human shape or shapes. Or you may hear your loved
    one's voice speak to you, either aloud or in your mind. Many people using this
    technique have seen (in the mirror) their loved one walk up and stand next to
    them and they had a conversation or a mental exchange of thoughts and feelings.
    Sometimes the loved one will appear to you and simply smile or wave. You may first
    see a group of people and then your loved one will walk out from the group to
    greet you.

    to find. Trophy shops or online occult stores may have them.

- en: You will almost certainly want to talk to someone about what happened so make
    sure that you have a friend or relative you can call afterward (or who is there
    waiting in another room). The visit with your loved one could be emotional, although
    most people feel elated after such a visit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Occasionally you will want to see a particular person, but another person will
    show up instead. Try to accept the spirit who visits you and see if they have
    a message to give you. They may have been sent on behalf of the person you wanted
    to see.
