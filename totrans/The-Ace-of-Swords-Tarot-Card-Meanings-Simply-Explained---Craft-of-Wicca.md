## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the Ace of Swords card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

Here is a new interpretation of the Ace of Swords tarot card:

 The Ace of Swords indicates a period of bold experimentation. In the modern world, you might consider trying out an up-and-coming new app or social media platform.

 Leaving the comfort of your old online presence can be risk and scary, but the time is right to strike a new direction. That app that looks good to you but no one thinks will take off is actually a good bet.

Since you will be among an early adopter, you will benefit the most when everyone else starts flocking to the platform.
