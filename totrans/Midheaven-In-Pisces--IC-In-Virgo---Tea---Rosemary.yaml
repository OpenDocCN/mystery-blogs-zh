- en: The Midheaven (MC) and the Imum coeli (IC) are two opposite points in astrology
    that are calculated based on your place and time of birth. The IC shows the qualities
    that you learned in childhood and the environment that you wanted to escape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to get away from the values of the IC, you push towards the Midheaven.
    In fact, the Midheaven is how people tend to perceive you in the outer world,
    but more specifically in your career. Although you may embrace the qualities of
    your Midheaven, the IC always exists underneath.

- en: The IC in Virgo placement is all about feeling judged or *wrong* as a child.
    When you become an adult, you try to expand and escape the box that you feel you’re
    in through your Midheaven in Pisces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that the Midheaven and IC are always opposite signs, so you can’t
    have one without the other.

- en: With your IC in Virgo, your parents were tough to please. Although you were
    the golden child in some way and had your parents’ full attention, you also felt
    constant the pressure because all eyes were on you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being the golden child wasn’t as great as others may have thought. You never
    caught a break and always knew that you were being watched with high hopes.

- en: In some manner, you were the smart or gifted kid in your family with your IC
    in Virgo. You may have also felt like the adult of your childhood friends; you
    never quite fit in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a child with your IC in Virgo, you were a perfectionist in certain areas.
    You were probably very hard on yourself because you had to take on large amounts
    of responsibility, so you always pushed yourself to do better in your hobbies,
    in school, at home, or in other areas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often, people with IC in Virgo grew up surrounded by adults. Although these
    folks are typically creative, they also felt the heaviness of being around adults
    and judged themselves compared to the grown-ups around them, which wasn’t an accurate
    reference.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With your IC in Virgo, you were scared by chaos. Order was the only way that
    anything made sense. You were always trying to sort and categorize things when
    your life felt out of control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You truly believed that if you were able to organize and sort things, you could
    be someone worthy of love and transcend the judgments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably had strict rules or standards that you had to adhere to. Even if
    your parents didn’t actually *say* what they expected from you, the *weight* of
    these expectations was enough to make you take on responsibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you ever failed to live up to your standards, then you felt that you had
    disappointed the whole world.

- en: Because you always felt as though you were under a microscope, you looked for
    an escape. With IC in Virgo, this escape can come in the form of books, fantasies,
    music, activities, or even by playing games with yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may have been very creative and you used this creativity to get away from
    the heaviness of your life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason that you tried to escape is because you needed to get away from the
    pressure of your IC in Virgo. For example, many girls with this placement want
    to live in a fairytale because it’s hard to cope with reality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your IC in Virgo childhood also generated a sense of shame or guilt. You had *super*
    high expectations for yourself and always felt that you weren’t good enough. There
    may be a vague sense that something is wrong with you deep down, that you can’t
    measure up, but you try to avoid these feelings at all costs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To compensate, you attempted to be *perfect*. Ultimately, you felt that you
    were always hiding this “bad” self and attempting to only show others your best
    qualities, yet the “real” you always existed within.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You tried to *fix* everything and everyone, including yourself. If something
    went wrong, it was your responsibility to make it right, but your biggest project
    was creating a self that you could be proud of, someone who wouldn’t be judged.

    Order still has a place, but it doesn’t give you a true sense of satisfaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You tried to fix yourself, to change yourself into someone you could approve
    of, but you never escaped the sense of shame that you were missing qualities or
    weren’t worthy of others’ affection. You find that order doesn’t actually change
    the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With your Midheaven in Pisces, you start to understand that perfect order is
    impossible. There is beauty in the mess. You learn that things don’t always work
    out *perfectly *and that there’s bigger and better things out there than just
    being liked or judged.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you may come off as a bit depressed or erratic with your Midheaven
    in Pisces. You may also be ultra-messy, unorganized, or super-sensitive. These
    can seem like different qualities to others, but this way is actually better for
    you because of the judgment you experienced in childhood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re a bit of a disappearing act. When you have Midheaven in Pisces, you’re
    erratic in your work. You might be super consistent for a month, then disappear
    for a bit. You work super hard when you’re excited about something, but as soon
    as that excitement fades, you’re onto the next thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important that your work is meaningful to you. At all times, you need to
    feel that you’re contributing something creative and different to the world. You
    can be spiritual or gifted, but you’re also creative, dreamy, and a bit evasive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in Pisces, you may come across as vague or aloof.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People with Midheaven in Pisces can feel lost. Sometimes, there is a lack of
    a sense of direction. It seems better to get lost in the massive chaos of the
    world than it does to be judged in your childhood, but you can then struggle because
    you don’t know where you end and others begin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When this happens, you need to revert back to your IC in Virgo, clear your head,
    and use discernment to figure out how you feel. Ultimately, you should use your
    IC to dig deeper into your Pisces-like feelings to create a holistic picture of
    yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More than any other placement, it is very important that you use both your IC
    in Virgo and Midheaven in Pisces. The Virgo/Pisces duality often requires elements
    of both signs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s essential that you learn how to condense the energy of the world into a
    message that others can understand. Any work that you do will be very important
    and impactful. However, you need to integrate the messages you learned in childhood
    with who you are now in order to tap into this expansive energy and make it happen.

    in Pisces, by connecting to the energy of the Universe and learning that love
    is all around you.
