- en: The Midheaven (MC) and the Imum coeli (IC) are two opposite points in astrology
    that are calculated based on your place and time of birth. The IC shows the qualities
    that you learned in childhood and the environment that you wanted to escape.

  zh: 天顶（MC）和Imum coeli（IC）是根据你的出生地点和时间计算的占星学中的两个相反点。IC显示了你在童年学到的品质和你想要逃避的环境。
- en: In order to get away from the values of the IC, you push towards the Midheaven.
    In fact, the Midheaven is how people tend to perceive you in the outer world,
    but more specifically in your career. Although you may embrace the qualities of
    your Midheaven, the IC always exists underneath.

  zh: 为了摆脱IC的价值观，你向天顶迈进。事实上，天顶是人们在外部世界中，特别是在你的职业生涯中，如何看待你的方式。虽然你可能接受你的天顶的特质，IC始终存在于其下。
- en: The IC in Virgo placement is all about feeling judged or *wrong* as a child.
    When you become an adult, you try to expand and escape the box that you feel you’re
    in through your Midheaven in Pisces.

- en: As a child with your IC in Virgo, you were a perfectionist in certain areas.
    You were probably very hard on yourself because you had to take on large amounts
    of responsibility, so you always pushed yourself to do better in your hobbies,
    in school, at home, or in other areas.

  zh: 你试图逃避的原因是因为你需要摆脱处女座天顶的压力。例如，许多有这个星位的女孩希望生活在童话中，因为难以应对现实。

    high expectations for yourself and always felt that you weren’t good enough. There
    may be a vague sense that something is wrong with you deep down, that you can’t
    measure up, but you try to avoid these feelings at all costs.
