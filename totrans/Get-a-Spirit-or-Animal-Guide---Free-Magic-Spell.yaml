- en: It might. I doubt the whole ''guess the animal'' part, because anyone could
    say ''I like this animal, it's my spirit guide'' when it's not. To get a spirit
    animal or guide is through a spiritual journey [also, theres the matter of appropriating
    native culture since spirit animals/totums/guides are native] I would say this
    chant before meditating, or before bed, then be observant, journal, and be open
    to anything. Also, be aware that just because a crow lands in front of you, it's
    not your spirit animal. Should you see crows everywhere [groups everywhere you
    go, pictures in buildings or online, articles about crows and their spiritual
    significance, overhearing people talking about crows, and dreaming about them]
    this would be considered a sign that a crow is your spirit animal. If you're already
    obsessed with a specific animal, your mind might be seeking patterns that aren't
    there. Try it if you wish, but I would research going to a ritual [lead by a reputable
    person of the native community] or other more in depth rituals/meditations on
    the subject
