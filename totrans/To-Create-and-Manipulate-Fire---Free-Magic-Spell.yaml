- en: This spell will let you create and manipulate fire. However, you won?t be able
    to manipulate natural occurring fire, only that which you have created. This spell
    works best if you are a natural born fire element or your star sign is a fire
    element (Sagittarius, Leo, or Aries).

- en: Before you begin, find a place where there are little to no flammable things
    around. While you should theoretically be able to control the flame... better
    safe than sorry. Also, you shouldn’t cast this spell unless you are an experienced
    sorcerer/sorceress. If you are inexperienced in the practice of magic, you are
    more likely to accidentally let your emotions get in the way of your control over
    the magic. If that happens, the effects could be disastrous.

    isn’t natural, the victim’s soul will most likely be destroyed and when they die,
    they will become a malevolent spirit - in other words, hell bent on revenge against
    you and everyone you love.
