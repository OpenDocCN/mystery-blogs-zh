    wouldn't personally know.

- en: Not sure exactly how this works. Perhaps it creates a servitor or egregore which
    follows the person? It might work well on people with good psychic skills or abilities.
    As for normal people, most ''normals'' usually have some kind of ability or psychic
    skill. So it should work for them, but not at the same strength as psychics.

    this mean anything?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This requires an edit, but sounds plausible. This appears to be a jinx, not
    a sixth sense ability. Since you are directing this on someone, the object should
    either belong to them, or be a photo of them. Focus your intention on them, imagine
    exactly what you want to happen as clearly as possible. The chant should be repeated
    more than three times. Chants build energy. The more you chant, the stronger the
    spell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you hear voices in your head, and you are not clairaudient, this would indicate
    you are not directing the energy on your target. If your object is reflective,
    that would send the energy back. The other option could be, you accidentally summoned
    something. This chant calls on *shadow spirits*. If you do not work with spirits,
    or do not specify the spirit, you are open the door for anything to visit. If
    you do not have your protections up, the spirit might walk in and decide to target
    you instead because they do not work with you and you let them in. The other option
    could be you conjured a shadow person. That is very dangerous. A shadow person
    is a spiritual being who feeds on misfortune. They look like a shadow of a person
    that walks along your walls. Have your protections in place before trying this
    spell.

- en: Thank you so much! That was very helpful. I think I may be clairaudient, however,
    so that's better than the other outcomes. But, it still feels like I did plenty
    of black magic on a certain group of people who have been harassing me, and it
    seems it's just backfired. I may just be new, but that slightly worries me...
