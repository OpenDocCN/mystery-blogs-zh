# Bannishing Fear and Shame

If you are ashamed from something or you are even afraid from dark forces or else,you can use this magic to get rid of them.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Bannishing Fear and Shame'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 cup of chanted water

*   1/2 tea spoon of sugar

*   1/2 tea spoon of salt

*   1/2 lemon

*   1/2 package of baking soda

*   Circle of stones

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 cup of chanted water

*   1/2 tea spoon of sugar

*   1/2 tea spoon of salt

*   1/2 lemon

*   1/2 package of baking soda

*   Circle of stones

 First have a seat. The circle of stones should be in front of you. Now you chant your water (you can make up your own spell for that, it doesn't have to be rhymed) and make it holy. Then you add the sugar and the salt and the half lemon. Put a spoon in the cup and mix it all up. Then put the baking soda in, not the whole package but a little. Then you mix it up again. You say the spell and then you drink the potion.

You chant three times:"Take my fear away same and easy as at night on my bed I lay! Banish this shame,let it just burn in the midnight flame. Now into a brave person I turn!"

Duplicate. As I said on the other post, this might help you if you are working though a memory of a shameful experience, or to conquer fears, but this potion will not remove shame and fear forever.
