    to your enemy and make sure you are worked up into a rage before doing the spell.
    This will make it all the more effective! When you are done see if you can hide
    this string (with the knots now tied) around you enemies home! This will make
    it more potent! If not then save it in a special place until you decide to untie
    the knots and give your enemy a second chance.
