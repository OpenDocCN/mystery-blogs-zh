- en: In the natal chart, Venus-Mars aspects indicate how connected your senses of
    love, beauty, and femininity are with your masculine, active, and competitive
    side.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don’t find that these aspects change a person’s *outer* personality to a large
    degree. Instead, these aspects are often felt *inside* to the individual. If you
    have one of these Venus-Mars aspects, you’ll feel the effects more than others
    will notice these qualities within you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Venus-Mars aspects will also impact a person’s love life or alter
    the “type” of person they are naturally attracted to. Learning about these aspects
    can be really helpful because they can give you a sense of direction in your love
    life and explain why you may be struggling.

    or your need to be with someone else, whether you get into serious or casual relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    love.
  prefs: []

    you’re drive to obtain. You can’t separate your innate drive from your sense of
    desire.

    your attitude towards romantic relationships; typically, the sign of the Venus
    conjunct Mars has some influence here. Specifically, how you relate to the parent
    of the opposite sex will determine how you relate to your partners, regardless
    of your sexual orientation.
  prefs: []

    to have strong emotions and treat everything as quite intense, especially love
    and romance.

    have a strong “flirty” streak that can cause problems for you. This is another
    effect of the masculine and feminine energies meshing. You may feel that it’s
    especially important to remain desirable to the opposite sex in general, even
    if you’re in a committed relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    drive, your personality comes off as pleasant, unlike someone with an aggressive
    Mars placement. This will make it easy for you to get things done when you set
    your mind to something. Others will be willing to help you instead of fighting
    against you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and masculine qualities when you need to, but the conjunction also gives you a
    certain appeal that can help you succeed.

    energy can be released sexually, but it’s also a good idea to find physical ways
    to burn off excess energy, such as running or working out. Even an active job
    can help release pent up energy.

    that fulfills your ideal image. It can feel like the timing is always off when
    you meet someone, or maybe the person turns out to be different than you expected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As much as you *want *to be in a relationship with Venus square Mars, you will
    struggle to actually stay with a person (or they may not stay with you) and will
    always feel that there’s *something* off. You can never exactly figure out what
    went wrong.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When your needs aren’t being met in a relationship, your frustration may come
    out sideways. Venus square Mars indicates that you can be passive-aggressive or
    act behind a partner’s back when you aren’t feeling fulfilled.

    don’t be too concerned if you have this aspect. It can be worked on!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    relationship that’s stuck in your head. You have to push through the hard times
    that you will inevitably encounter in relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t ever give up with Venus square Mars. It’s easy to put your past relationship
    behind you and look for someone new, but if you don’t change *yourself* based
    on the lessons learned then you’ll fall into the same type of partnership over
    and over. That doesn’t mean that your relationships won’t run their course (sometimes,
    you simply *must* move on from a partner), but you have to learn and change from
    your past mistakes and beliefs in order to be more successful in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learn how to express yourself in a straightforward manner with your partner
    instead of retaliating. You may feel like you’re always at war when you’re in

    competition that you see in order to be truly happy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s hard for people with Venus square Mars to calm down and work out issues
    that arise. With this aspect, you may be unsure if you love or hate the other
    person, and you certainly aren’t thinking about how you can explain your feelings
    to your partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you *must* learn to look inside. At first, you are drawn to status
    and image (Venus) as well as a sense of competition and excitement (Mars) in a
    relationship. Yet in order for a relationship to truly be successful, you need
    to integrate Venus and Mars within yourself, balancing the masculine and the feminine
    energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, you can develop a relationship that is both fun and active *and* still
    emotionally balanced and beautiful.

    understand how sex fits in with love. For you, the two are always at odds, or
    you may keep sex and love separate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect sometimes means that you have the virgin/whore complex. You might
    see partners *either* as someone to pair with sexually, or as someone you’re interested
    in romantically, but you have trouble meshing these two ideas to have a successful
    monogamous relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you learn to comprehend then explain your emotions (rather than allowing
    them to come out sideways), your viewpoints surrounding sex and intimacy will
    change, too. You will find that you *want* to be physically close to the person
    you love and will start to develop sexual relationships that also feel loving.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that, with Venus square Mars, you don’t need to allow yourself to be
    dominated nor must you dominate others. In a truly balanced relationship, both
    people care for each other and push each other to succeed without a sense of competition *between*
    the partners.
