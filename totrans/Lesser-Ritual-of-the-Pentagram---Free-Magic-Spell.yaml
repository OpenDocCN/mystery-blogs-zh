    preliminary to any magical operation and precedes the Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.

- en: 'Note: The subject of the vibration of Names of Power is discussed at length
    in other sources. The Names should be pronounced inwardly in the breath, vibrating
    it as much as possible and feeling that the whole body throbs with the sound and
    sends out a wave of vibration directed to the ends of the Earth, according to
    Regardie. Time and continuous practice of the ritual, an invoking ritual, in the
    morning and a banishing ritual, in the evening, are standard recommendations,
    and will produce the desired result. There is no particular frequency or degree
    of volume that is suitable for every individual. Each person must practice to
    find the resonant vibration that will work for him/her. Some benefit can be obtained
    by listening to the chants of Tibetan Monks that can be found on cassette and
    CD. Other occultists assert that definite somatic effects will manifest when the
    vibrated Names are performed correctly, such as tingling in certain areas of the
    body. I believe it is important to vibrate the Names at the same time one imagines
    the Name in scintillate white Light, rushing upward through the body and outwards
    toward the end of the Universe in the particular direction one is working with.
    It is important to pronounce the Names correctly and clearly and, according to
    Traditional Jewish sources, never pronounce the Names casually, but only in Holy
    or Theurgic Work. One is admonished to NEVER lower the hand or Magical Instrument
    while tracing the Circle or at any other time, unless specifically instructed
    to do so. It is designed to use the banishing variation of the ritual after it''s
    invoking variation.'
