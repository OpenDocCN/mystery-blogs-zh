- en: Introduction:This is a ritual from Korea. By performing this ritual you are
    supposed to get to ''a different world.'' According to people that have successfully
    completed the game, it looks the same as the town/ building that you are from,
    but all the lights are off and you can only see a red cross in the distance. There
    are no other living things there except yourself. Some say electronics like phones,
    cameras, etc. don't work, while some say they do. Also, some say that getting
    back to the real world is harder for some reason.

    seems to get further and further away as you walk towards it.

    is not a Korean ritual, it is a silly game similar to Bloody Mary.

    first place. This is a game to scare kids similar to Bloody Mary. It is not a
    genuine ritual.
