- en: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZ58HliYLs this video is easy to understand,
    just follow the instructions. Or you can try mine. Keep in mind that they use
    more strands and colors, when you’ll just be using twine. Also, they say to knot
    everything twice. Only do this if you want thicker stripes or are using really
    thin twine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Get out your twine and match up the ends of four different colors. Measure
    out a length that wraps around your wrist about two and a half or three times.
    Cut the strands and tie them together.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Tape your bracelet to a table, wall, chair, anything close by. You can also
    cut more twine and tie it to a chair and have someone sit in the chair. Sort out
    your strands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Take the strand closest to your left hand (right if you’re a leftie). Let’s
    say this strand is blue. Pick blue up over the next strand, green. It should form
    a 4, with green as the straight line and blue as the little triangle part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Cross the end of blue under green and up through the triangle in the 4\.
    Pull tight.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5\. Pick up blue again and do the same knot on red, the next thread. Then purple.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6\. When you’ve finished the row, pick up the thread that is now at the start
    of the row (next to your left or right hand) and do the same think. Don’t forget
    to tie it around the last thread, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7\. Continue in this pattern. If you want to attach charms, feathers, or beads,
    thread them onto a strand and keep on going. Once you get a little practice, you
    can make all sorts of cool patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 8\. When you’re done, tie the loose ends together. Then have someone help you
    tie the bracelet onto your wrist or the recipient’s wrist, so you won’t always
    be tightening it like me.

    A strength bracelet might have red and brown strands for fire and earth, or a
    protective bracelet might have purple and blue. Mix and match to get different
    results.

- en: The web is an amazing place, and it has a ton of cool patterns. Alter the way
    you make your bracelets and find what works best for you. I personally prefer
    candy stripe (what my instructions are for) because it’s simple and can be done
    with just four strands, but chevron and ladder are also great choices. They just
    take longer.
