    It requires more than saying ''here dragon'' to summon an astral being.

    approach the 'dragon' as an archetype of primordial fire and illumination.
  prefs: []

    task. For example writer's block or if you have been feeling uninspired to create,
    draw, paint, etc.

    light the fire. Envision the earthen circle as your ideas, trapped and unmoving,
    stubbornly locked in place. As you draw the triangle, affirm it to be the doorway
    of your mind into those trapped ideas. Light the fire, declaring it a torch brought
    into the prison of your ideas, bringing light and burning away the cage holding
    them.

    Then hold it over the ashes and embers (for only a second, as if bowing over them)
    then back up to touch your brow before putting it away. While moving athame from
    brow to embers to brow is when one would speak;

    the form of a dragon) to bring inspiration to your endeavors.
