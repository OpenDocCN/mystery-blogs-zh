    to help for, perhaps their entwined initials or the initial of their forename
    coupled with something which brings them to mind and look up the sigil of their
    sun sign.

- en: Once you've created your Sacred Space, consecrate the candle and the stone in
    the usual way. Carve both the sigils into it, together with the caduceus. Next
    take the oil and anoint the candle, starting in the center and working out towards
    the ends. Now hold the candle up and say " I call upon the Goddess and God,upon
    the healers of all. As this candle burns bring health and strength to ( name of
    the person your trying to heal). Blessed Be."

- en: Light the candle and, while looking at the flame, visualize the person and the
    healing process taking place. When you feel that your magic has started, take
    the stone and anoint it with a drop of the oil. Hold this up and say " I call
    upon the Goddess and the God, upon the healers of all. Lend your strength to this
    token to bring health and healing to ( name). As he/she carries it may he/she
    grow daily in health and strength. Blessed Be."

    to your loved one as soon as possible. If they are not prepared/fit to carry it,
    then place it by the side of their bed.
