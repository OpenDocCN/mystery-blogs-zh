 ## The Summer Solstice Litha Ceremony Script

### Casting the Circle

To begin the Litha ceremony, start by casting the circle. This is done to create a sacred space for your ritual. Take your [wand](https://craftofwicca.com/a-wiccan-guide-to-wands-how-to-make-or-buy-a-witch-wand/), [athame](https://craftofwicca.com/athame-ultimate-guide-ceremonial-blade/), or finger and point it towards the ground. Starting in the North, move clockwise around the circle, visualizing a circle of energy forming around you. Say the following words as you move around the circle:

“I cast this circle to create a sacred space. May it protect and empower us as we honor the sun on this Litha day.”

### Calling the Quarters

Next, call the quarters. This is done to honor the four elements and ask for their presence and blessings in your ceremony. Start in the East and move clockwise around the circle. Face each direction and call out to the corresponding element:

 “Guardians of the East, element of Air, I call upon you to join us in this Litha celebration. Bring your wisdom and clarity to our minds as we seek to grow and evolve.”

 “Guardians of the South, element of Fire, I call upon you to join us in this Litha celebration. Bring your passion and courage to our hearts as we pursue our dreams and ambitions.”

“Guardians of the West, element of Water, I call upon you to join us in this Litha celebration. Bring your emotions and intuition to our spirits as we connect with our inner selves.”

 “Guardians of the North, element of Earth, I call upon you to join us in this Litha celebration. Bring your stability and strength to our bodies as we ground ourselves in nature.”

### Invoking the God and Goddess

After calling the quarters, it is time to invoke the God and [Goddess](https://craftofwicca.com/goddess-brighid-invocation-offerings/). This is done to honor the divine masculine and feminine energies and ask for their blessings in your ceremony. You can use any invocation that resonates with you, but here is an example:

 “Great God of the Sun, I invoke your presence on this Litha day. May your warmth and light guide us through the long summer days and inspire us to pursue our passions.”

 “Great Goddess of the Earth, I invoke your presence on this Litha day. May your nurturing and fertile energy bring abundance and growth to our apartments and gardens, and may your wisdom guide us on our journey of personal growth.”

 ### Celebrating the Sun

After invoking the God and Goddess, it is time to celebrate the sun. This can be done in many ways, but here are a few suggestions:

*   Dance around a bonfire or a candle, honoring the sun’s light and warmth.
*   Sing or chant a Litha hymn, expressing gratitude for the abundance of nature.
*   Perform a sun salutation yoga sequence, connecting with the energy of the sun and its life-giving properties.

### Offering and Blessing

Next, it is time to make an offering to the God and Goddess and ask for their blessings. This can be done by offering food, wine, flowers, or any other gift representing your gratitude and respect. You can also ask for blessings for yourself, your loved ones, and the world around you. Here is an example of an offering and blessing:

 “We offer this fruit and wine to the God and Goddess, honoring their divine presence on this Litha day. We ask for their blessings of abundance, growth, and fertility, and we offer our gratitude for the beauty of nature and the warmth of the sun. So mote it be.”

### Closing the Circle

To close the Litha ceremony, it is essential to close the circle and thank the elements, the God and Goddess, and any other beings you called upon. Move counterclockwise around the circle, facing each direction, and saying the following words:

 “Guardians of the North, West, South, and East, we thank you for your presence and blessings in this Litha ceremony. May your energies guide us on our journey of growth and transformation.”

 “Great God of the Sun and Goddess of the Earth, we thank you for your divine presence and blessings on this Litha day. May your energy continue to nourish and inspire us throughout the year.”

Finally, point your wand, athame, or finger toward the ground and say:

 “I release this circle of energy, knowing that its power will continue to protect and empower us in our daily lives. So mote it be.”
