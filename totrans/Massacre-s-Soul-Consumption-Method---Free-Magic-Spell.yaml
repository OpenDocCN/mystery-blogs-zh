    items for this spell:** First off, be completely relaxed. Meditate, and go into
    a trance state (Preferably the Alpha state, but Theta is more powerful. I found
    this visual method more powerful. Mother and Father use this method as well.)
    With your eyes closed, visualise them in front of you, with their back to you.'

- en: Visualise you consuming their aura in any way. You could visualise yourself
    actually eating and ingesting their aura until it's gone, or you could visualise
    yourself drawing in their aura into your sacral/sexual chakra. ALWAYS draw in
    energy with your female chakras, as they absorb energy; male chakras project energy.

    phasing through their back. When you pull your hand away, you should be holding
    a bottle of white-gold liquid, glowing as bright as the sun. This represents their
    soul.
  prefs: []

- en: With this bottle of while-gold liquid in your hands, open up the top, and start
    drinking it. As you make each gulp, you take and consume more of their soul. Visualise
    the individual getting weaker as more of their soul is consumed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have consumed every last drop of the liquid, visualise pitch black
    energy going into the bottle. This will render them defenseless, making them even
    more vulnerable to psychic attacks and black magick workings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the bottle is completely filled with the pitch black energy, visualise
    it condensing into a liquid as dark as a black hole. Close the bottle, and visualise
    your hand and the bottle phasing into their back. Once when you put the bottle
    intp the individual, pull your hand away. They will be more open and vulnerable,
    and you can use their energy and soul as you wish. I recommend transforming them
    into grey energy, the most devastating energy, and directing it back to them.
    Grey energy is death energy.
