Really handy list of herbs to begin working with. I'll definitely keep this in my favorites as a reference.

I have heard that sage is also useful for cleansing your room/house from negative energy

It is true that sage is useful in cleansing in your home from negative energy by burning it.

Ack I don¬ít have half of these!

Nice stuff to have for your rituals I just need to know where I can find them üòäüòä

If ask my mum to buy all of these I would be dead TvT. They are expensive

va6Moon I get mine online very affordable. Perhaps you could do that dear.

There are also many things you don't need to buy that you already have at home like cinnamon, salt etc.

Definitely the same with me. my mum would be very suspicious bc she doesn't know that I like these sort of things and that I am a member. (in fact, I don't even think she is very keen on magic, but I am)

When it comes to herbs, you have options. Witchcraft was originally practiced by people who gardened and forested. You can grow herbs, you can also purchase many of these at a grocery store and claim you're interested in baking/cooking. As for items like frankincense and sandalwood, there are alternatives with similar magickal properties. [example, both frankincense and sandalwood has cleansing/protective qualities, but so does salt]

This is good to know. I am a new member and I have barely any supplies
