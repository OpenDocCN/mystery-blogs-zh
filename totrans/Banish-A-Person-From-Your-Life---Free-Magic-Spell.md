Should i use olive oil if i dont have banishing oil?

(I'm not sure if this is legitimate so I'm not saying this is definitely correct) After doing some research, I think you can make Banishing oil using olive oil, and some other ingredients (check my photos for the actual oil recipe)

Yes. You can absolutely substitute the oil with olive oil. If you do not have a specific banishing candle, a black or white candle will work.

CelticRose is correct! I specifically used a banishing candle only because I'm trying to banish my abusive ex from my life. For me, I believe it to be stronger. Let me know how it works with the olive oil and black/white candles!

As is Galaxiistars! Sorry for not giving you credit earlier! Was in a rush!

Simple banishing that should work, but it depends on the situation. I am also curious what a ''banishing candle'' is. Is it simply a black candle, or are there herbs involved? This could increase the potency of the spell.

I'll do some research on it! I bought a candle from a local wiccan shop that said ''Banishing Candle'' and it said it could be used to banish negative entities and persons, but I'll look into what you asked and get back to you :)
