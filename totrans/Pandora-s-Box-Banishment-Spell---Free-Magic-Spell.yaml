    you must cast it outside on the night of a waning moon. Light a fire, and stare
    into it''s flames, focus on your intentions. Remember, you are about to banish
    your problems. Once you think you''re ready, take your box or bag. Put all of
    the things that represents your problem in the box, make sure they can be burnt.
    Another alternative, is to write your problems on pieces of paper and put them
    in the box, this is a much safer way. But whichever method you use, it''s all
    up to you. Once this is done, close the box or bag and tie it with the string
    to seal it. You have created your Pandora''s box, where all your problems are
    kept. Now for the banishing part. Take your box, and throw it into the fire. Watch
    as the fire burns the box along with your problems. Then, say:'
