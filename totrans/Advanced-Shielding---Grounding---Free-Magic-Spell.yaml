    items for this spell:**I don''t think shielding should be that difficult. You
    will need a good imagination and visualize what I am going to tell you. I recommend
    making shields that surround you like a impenetrable bubble. They can be any color

- en: I'm not sure how this will work for you but there will be two layers of shielding.
    The outter layer will simply protect you and prevent any thing from entering,
    while destroying it with its energy. If something breaks in, the second layer
    will protect you and will also repeal the energy and bounce it back to whoever
    sent it.

- en: Shield your thoughts as well as blocking others from harming or influencing
    you badly in any way. If you think that as the purpose of your shield, then it
    will do so. The shield of the mind is created by a strong and happy memory. Think
    of the happiest moment in your life and imagine your mind and body being strengthened
    by it and helping you in casting the banishing spell or removing a binding.

    to do the banishing spell, and know that no outside force can break your defenses
    or curse you ever again.

- en: The shielding will take energy from you depending on how effective it is and
    how much energy you have. So rather than giving energy from yourself, do grounding.
    Imagine yourself being stabilized and the energy of nature coming to you from
    below your feet and making you able to stand your ground and strengthen you. This
    will help you.

- en: This requires an edit, but it does work. For those who cannot visualize, think
    of being safe. This could be a memory, it could even be a scene in a movie. You
    should charge energy into your body and push it outward to surround you in a protective
    bubble. You should feel the energy filling your body, and you should have a sense
    of safety when you shield. You will need to reflect on your shield throughout
    the day when you begin shielding to reinforce it. As you improve on this daily
    practice, you will only need to cast once a day.

- en: When shielding, it is helpful to also keep the image you hold simple. For example
    instead of trying to imagine the details of some form or armor, or layers of shields
    etc simply recognize yourself as radiant light.

- en: Indeed. It does not have to be elaborate. However, some people lack the ability
    to visualize a picture. Some simply need practice, but for others their mind simply
    cannot form picture perfect images no matter how much practice. For them, using
    a physical picture, a scene from a movie, or reading something that makes them
    feel safe would work better. It does not have to be the bubble most authors encourage,
    but as long as they feel the energy, then focus on something safe, it should work.

    It could be a personal religious symbol, a charm with significant personal meaning,
    or even a silver pendant or other representation of an object that represents
    strength, authority, or safety.

- en: Perhaps a pentagram or cross, or a moon pendant, a dragon or other power-creature,
    a feather, bullet, anything that speaks to the person and means ''I'm keeping
    you safe''. ...It isn't ideal to be depending on an external focus (because what
    if you lose it?) But it is a good place to start while you learn and get better
    at the practice.
