    in Wings, Aura, etc. of whatever you want your wolf to look like/have. But keep
    in mind, it must be realistic and precise, take art lessons or, if you''re a natural
    good drawer like myself, try to make it as high quality as you possibly can. Try
    to also avoid the obvious mistakes, like a Fire wolf with a Blue Aura, and only
    drawing the head. When you are finished with your sketch, write its height above
    it, and its length. Be precise. Then, colour it in according to its magic Element
    (See Below). STEP TWO Take a picture of yourself and print it on the same type
    of paper/papyrus. (NOT the one you used earlier on). Then stick it next to your
    wolf drawing, and write your height above your picture. STEP THREE Now, fold your
    paper/papyrus in half and on it, write its powers, like; Name:_________ Age:__________
    (or you can just write ∞) Powers:_______ Element:______ Accessories:__ After that,
    get your Silver/Gold pen or marker and draw a pentagram on either side. After
    that, hold the paper and chant: (Element) wolf of mine, come to me by egg of (Element).
    I summon thee, newborn mythical Creature, so mote it be! STEP FOUR Lastly, this
    is where you must put your heart and soul into this spell. Each day/night, at
    the same time you finished your drawing chant: O (your religious God), please
    grant my dream wolf from egg to end! (Element) wolf of mine, come to me by egg
    of (Element). I summon thee, newborn mythical Creature, so mote it be! On the
    third night, you should think of your wolf. You will dream of it with you. That
    following morning, you should look outside in your garden. If you see a cracked
    egg, or a hollowed-out egg, it doesn''t work for you. If not, and you see a perfect
    round rock, take it inside, if it looks like yours... Air-White Egg, Appears in
    the windiest spot of garden. Water-Blue Egg, Appears in Pool/Lake/Wettest Spot
    in your garden. Fire-Red Egg, Appears in BBQ/Hottest Spot in your garden. Earth-Green/Rock
    Egg, Appears in Garden/Greeniest Spot in your garden. I HOPE YOU GET YOUR WOLF!
    FAQ''S What if an Egg Doesn''t Appear After I Dreamt Of My Wolf? -Wait, and keep
    on chanting until you can find an egg or two; either cracked or like the following
    descriptions I mentioned above! What If My Dream Never Comes? -Test Your Magic
    At http://www.gotoquiz.com/how_much_magic_is_in_your_blood and see if you have
    enough magic to do this spell. What Should I Feed My Wolf? -Depends on their power,
    like Earth might be a veg., Fire eats BBQ meat, Air might like Candy Sprays or
    lamb, and Water might like Fish. Try ''em all!'

    around the site you can find some beginners guides in the articles and in the
    forums General Info section. Basically magick is a natural energy and can attract/repel
    a desired natural change. If a spell claims something unnatural there's a good
    chance the spell doesn't work because magick is a force of nature and works with
    it, not against it.

- en: RyanTheGay and Nekoshema the Spell title specifically says ''summon'', not ''manifest.''
    Manifesting is possible in magick! It may be it possible to manifest a physical
    wolf but this is *summoning* not manifestation. It is possible as long as you
    don't draw something unrealistic, like a wolf with bat wings or a wolf with antlers.
    Summoning would come from you thinking about it a lot of the time. Yes, if you're​
    continuously thinking about a realistic wolf, you are likely to summon it. Stop
    being rude and check your facts! Tw1st3dd, it is basically just three people actually
    acting like that, you do not need to worry about being bullied on this site, and
    you are less likely to be bullied on here than any other magick websites. I hope
    that you summon the most perfect wolf/dog you could have hoped for, and I hope
    that the rude people on this (and all other) magick sites actually start to read
    the titles of spells and understand the meanings of each and every word in the
    title.

- en: ok DessaFlame, we heard your point about summoning, enough already. eve if you
    call it summoning, you can't summon a physical wolf or dog instantly [you can
    manifest one by visualizing your desired outcome thus sending the wish to the
    universe] this spell boasts you can design an ''elemental'' wolf with wings and
    unnatural colours. this doesn't exist. you would be creating your own spiritual
    being, like a thoughtform or servitor, which wouldn't be summoning as it doesn't
    exist, it would be manifesting as you're shaping your energy into a desire. as
    for your constant blithering about reading the title, perhaps you should read
    the spells outline. you say it won't work if they're trying to summon a wolf with
    wings or antlers, read the second sentence, how it says you should draw those
    and other things to specify what you want your wolf to look like.

- en: This sort of thing depends on your beliefs. The ''egg'' cannot physically hatch
    but it can be carried as a good luck charm and at times you may have certain visions
    of your wolf. It will s because after you preformed the spell you thought about
    it constantly therefore when the puppy appeared you were looking for it in a way.
    This could be a fake spell depending on what you believe but I don't think that
    it is fake. There may not be a physical manifestation of the animal but there
    is a mental presence. I tried this and there was indeed a small dog hanging around
    me about a week later. Thats because I was looking for it and trying to attract
    such a pet.

    literally manifest a wolf in your yard. The spirit realm will allow you to summon
    and elemental wolf in the form of a pet dog with characteristics you want your
    wolf to have. Magic wont alter the physical world like in the movies atleast not
    this type. With practice you'd understand how magic works. Its not always literally
    the way you imagine it but it does work. Keep an open mind y'all

    is possible with real magick [becasue there is a difference between the magick
    real-life pagans work with and fantasy magic shown in movies] Magick is real,
    but it's not like in movies. Vampires are astral beings, the only vampires on
    the physical are psy vampires [humans who can drain energy] I doubt anyone would
    judge you, so your silly threat is rather uncalled for.
  prefs: []

- en: I've read most of the comments so let me clear this up. You cannot summon an
    elemental wolf. Magic does not work like that. If you believe this spell is real,
    try it yourself if you want to instead of complaining it is in the comments. Its
    not our job to control or manipulate you. Just don't waste your time doing this
    spell just to test it.

    part of the spell?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reading over it, this seems fake, but if it worked, it would be spiritual, so
    the wolf wouldn't be physical. If anyone could see it, it would be people who
    can see/sense spirits. This also sounds like you're creating a thoughtform or
    servitor and not summoning anything real [a thoughtform or servitor is created
    when you pool your energy into a shape. This energy takes on a life of its own
    and will disappear once you stop feeding it energy. Servitors are created for
    a specific purpose like you need it to find your keys and vanish once the task
    is done, while Thoughtforms linger for as long as you interact with them] if that's
    the case, you don't need to call on a deity, so either omit that part or change
    the wording to something like ''with my energy, I create you''

- en: So let me get this straight, it's obvious you can't create a physical wolf because
    it's impossible with magick, most of the people say you could create a servitor
    by doing it, some say you summon an astral being wolf, so what is it after all?
    I also have a question, could this spell help attract wolves? Like as lot of people
    saying this spell is based on manifestation so it could be possible to draw a
    physical wolf (not in an instant) by doing it, correct? If it isn't, then, I'm
    sorry, still new here
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's fine. If this spell works, you could create a servitor or invite an astral/spiritual
    being to you. As for the physical wolf, it's highly unlikely. If you live in an
    area where wolves are common, you might see one in the wild if you put the intention
    out there. Don't expect to wake up the next day with a pet wolf, but you might
    notice more items with wolf symbolism, shows about wolves, and possibly one day
    having a pet wolf, but magick follows the path of least resistance, and since
    most people don't own wolves, it's more likely you'll meet a spirit or astral
    wolf being than owning a physical wolf.
