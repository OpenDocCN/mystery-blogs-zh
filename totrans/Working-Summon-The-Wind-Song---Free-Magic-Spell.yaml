    in a very very very very very very very very very low voice you may get possessed!
    You can summon the wind with only the song AFTER you cast the spell.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do not ''hate'' anyone. I do not know you. Merely disagreeing with a person
    does not equate hatred. I comment on all fake spells regardless of user. I wish
    to help new members know which ones are a waste of their time so they do not get
    discouraged when their spells do not work. Whomever wrote them does not matter
    to me. If it is a fake spell, I will say so, there is no other motive beyond that.
    You should not take things so personally, not everything is about you. Sometimes
    people disagree, but it does not mean nefarious intentions.

  prefs: []

- en: A spell book in your basement you say? I also said I do not hate you. I do not
    know you. From the behaviour I have seen form you so far, and after reading your
    profile, I can conclude you are young, love Harry Potter, think you could be a
    vampire, and have zero understanding of Real Magic as well as zero patience for
    those who disagree with you. For the record, Magic is a natural energy that does
    not defy nature. It effects energy to bring natural change. You are human, and
    while Harry Potter is a fine series of books, it is a complete work of fiction.
    None of it is real.
