# Morning Wiccan Prayer – Spells8

> 来源：[https://spells8.com/morning-wiccan-prayer/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/morning-wiccan-prayer/#0001-01-01)

Say this prayer along with the video right after sunset, or as you wake up. Mornings can be a sacred time to connect with our spirituality as we get ready to receive the blessings of a new day.

Let me look at nature awhile.

The brilliant blue of the morning sea, of the cloudless sky,

the yellow shore; all lovely, all bathed in light.

Already over the sea from her old spouse she comes,

the blonde Goddess whose frosty wheels bring day.

Now drowsiness is richest, the morning air is cool,

and birds sing shrilly from their tender throats.

How many times I’ve wished Night would not yield to you,

the stars not fade and flee before your face!

Empress Mother,

I thank you for this new day

Thanks for the life you give me

Guide my steps and let everything I do be blessed.

Give me wisdom and strength to stand strong through any storm.

Cover me with your light so that nothing can harm me.

Make of today a productive day and help me achieve all my goals.

Show me a joyful day and teach me to radiate happiness.

In the silence of this day that begins,

I come to ask for peace, prudence, strength.

Thank you, Mother, for pouring blessings in my life.

For giving me new life and an opportunity to start again.

Today I have the power to change everything that’s bad into bright blessings.

Today I declare myself free from all oppression, disease and suffering.

Today I want to look at the world with eyes full of love,

to be patient, understanding and wise.

Thank you for this prayer that is a seed sown in the heart of your Grace.

The rising sun has crowned the hills,

And added beauty to the plain;

O grand and wondrous spectacle!

That only nature could explain.
