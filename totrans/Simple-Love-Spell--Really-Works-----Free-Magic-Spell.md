# Simple Love Spell (Really Works!)

This spell will help you get someone you love to fall in love with you. I found this spell in an old spell book in my basement, and a friend of mine tried it and the person she casted it on fell in love with her 48 hours(2 days) later. Do NOT cast this spell if the person you are casting it on is in love with you or you are dating them or else it will backfire!

Will it still work if I dont have rose petals ?

It should. I would substitute it with another item with love energy [rosemary, or an apple works]

What are you suppose to do with the heart/photo? Do you burn them, bury, or keep them?

I'm not a creep so I don't have their picture... will their name work instead?

Hi. I did this spell about 3 days ago and havent seen anything happen yet. But I saw someone say to burn the heart/pic after the spell is cast. I didnt know at the time so I did it tonight. Will this make the spell work within 2 days from me burning the pic? Also, has anyone else had success with this spell? Thanks!

so what happened with your spell?

By backfire does that mean she will be in love with me, but she will also be very possessive and jealous if I talk anyone? Or what?

Love spells typically backfire by the person hating you. A love spell resulting in a stalker is because you didn't think it through completely and/or put too much energy into it [think of the chant, say you go ''we shall never part'' that could result in the literal interpretation of the person never leaving your side. Coupled with the spell, they could become jealous if they see you talking to anyone who isn't them]

I do not have glue but I have tape. And I thunk chnaging roses to rosemarry and suger is good subsitute. I am going to try this.

I did this spell yesterday. How would I know if the spell took it effects on the other person?

I tried this spell. Did not work. I did everything and put my intentions into it. Oh well.

Okay, seeing your comment, I'm not going to try it anymore

Has anyone tried? Is it ultimately useful?
