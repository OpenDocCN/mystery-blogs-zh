    heard of the Law of Attraction until a few years ago. Now, I will admit that part
    of it rubs me the wrong way but **I think that’s because I don’t know too much
    about it**. I thought I would share my research and learning with you!

    the ability to manifest that which we focus on.**

- en: It is the Law of Attraction which uses the power of the mind to translate whatever
    is in our thoughts and materialize them into reality. In basic terms, **all thoughts
    turn into things eventually** . If you focus on negative doom and gloom you will
    remain under that cloud. If you focus on positive thoughts and have goals that
    you aim to achieve you will find a way to achieve them with massive action. (1)

- en: So one of my biggest cringes with the Law of Attraction is that it sounds very
    victim-blamey to me. The Law of Attraction says that **everything in your life
    happens because you’ve manifested it** - or that’s how I have come to understand
    it. Since I believe strongly against this, I decided to dig into where the Law
    of Attraction stands on things like poverty, assault, and the like.

    to suffer as she did with all of the hardships she was faced with? Wasn’t there
    a better way to inspire millions of people? **You might say yes. You might say
    no.** Hear me out - was that her Karma or was it just bad genetics? Was it the
    Law of Attraction that made her deaf and blind while still in the womb?

    this I suppose.** I believe that the Law of Attraction can work for a lot of people,
    but I feel that many who use or preach about the Law of Attraction are also taking
    part in something called Spiritual Bypass. Spiritual Bypass is essentially only
    focusing on the positive aspects of life while bypassing, or ignoring, anything
    negative that may happen. From a psychological perspective, that’s just not healthy.'

    arsenal of magickal education.** However, I think we must be careful when speaking
    to others about the Law of Attraction. I am someone who has suffered trauma. I
    have been through things that no one should have to experience, and I fully believe
    that my five-year-old self did not manifest the atrocities that I experienced.
    When we start to tell people that what they are experiencing or have experienced
    is their own fault, we really move into a gray area of psychological issues and
    magickal issues.'

    wounds and move on with her life.'

    *in general* . I am opposed to the use of the Law of Attraction to blame people
    for anything bad that has happened in their life. Sometimes it is a situation
    that can’t be controlled on their part. Sometimes it’s their Gods. Sometimes it’s
    just crappy luck.

    All laws of nature are completely perfect and the Law of Attraction is no exception.
    No matter what you are looking to have or achieve or be in life, if you can hold
    onto an idea and see it for yourself in the mind’s eye, you can make it yours
    to have… with some effort on your part. (1)
