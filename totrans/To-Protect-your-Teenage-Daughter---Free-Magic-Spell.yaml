- en: This spell arises out of the ceremonies to honour the Maize Goddess in Mexico.
    Today it deals effectively with teenage fears and difficulties, particularly as
    it honours the maiden aspect of the triple goddess. It is in many ways a rite
    of passage and is both a protection and an initiation. It should not be performed
    unless the girl herself feels that she is ready for such a ceremony, or in need
    of it.

- en: Traditionally this ceremony was carried out to cleanse and protect a young girl
    who had been frightened by inopportune advances, whether human or otherwise. It
    is inevitable that the teenagers of today will find difficulty in talking about
    their fears and doubts, but if they can be encouraged to think about them prior
    to this spell it is helpful.

- en: The girl should be dressed in the white gown and then lie face downwards with
    her arms spread outwards in the shape of a cross. If using candles place them
    either at her hands, her feet and head or in all four positions. Do whatever you
    intuitively feel is right.

- en: 'Sweep her back and legs with the silks, using the blessed water at the same
    time. Sprinkle her from head to foot with the water. Petition the goddess using
    words such as: "Goddess of fertility, power and love: Bless this child here tonight.
    Protect, guard and guide her as she grows to womanhood. Let her not be troubled
    by childish fears. But grow to be the woman that she knows she can be."'

- en: Ask the girl now to think about her own future to take time to dream and imagine
    the sort of person she would like to be. As you sit quietly with her visualize
    a white light surrounding her and ask that she be protected from harm. You might
    at this point wish to make use of the opportunity to encourage her to talk about
    her dreams and fears, but try not to put pressure on her.

- en: If you have used candles then you can snuff them out but do not use for other
    magic. Hopefully this will give your teenager a deeper appreciation of who she
    is and what she may become. Obviously she must give her consent to what you do
    together, and it is a time which must be treated sensitively. Knowing that she
    is protected does not give licence to take risks, simply to act responsibly.
