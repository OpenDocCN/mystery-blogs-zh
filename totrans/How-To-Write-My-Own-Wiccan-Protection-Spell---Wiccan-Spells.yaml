    the significance of Wiccan protection spells. Wicca, a modern-day pagan religious
    movement, works with the concept of energy and the belief that everything in the
    universe is interconnected. Protection spells are aimed at creating a barrier
    against negative energies, psychic attacks, and unwanted influences that may disrupt
    one’s personal or spiritual well-being. These spells can provide a sense of security
    and serenity, creating a space of positivity and harmony.
