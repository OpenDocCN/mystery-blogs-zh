- en: All of us need to give advice every once in a while, but we frequently lack
    the confidence needed to do it. Many have been helped by this spell in these types
    of situations. It is best to do this spell during Scorpio. If the moon is waning
    when you cast the spell it won’t work. You can strengthen the magic that is being
    made if you spread out a green cloth on your work surface and wear green clothes.

    sheet of paper before you pick up your malachite crystal and hold it tight in
    one hand. While focusing on it and ask silent that you be blessed with being able
    to listen to what is being said to you with understanding and compassion and to
    allow you to speak with wisdom and assurance. Ask for your throat, ears and mouth
    to be blessed. Then light your green candle and take the paper that your prayer
    or verse is written on and set it on fire with the flame. Place the burning paper
    inside of your fireproof dish, and stand in front of the altar with your arms
    raised high over your head, and say the following:'

    Then perform your closing ritual. As you are leaving your sacred space you can
    be confident that you will soon be blessed with wisdom.
