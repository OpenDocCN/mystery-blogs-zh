- en: This spell is for those of you who were born Vampires, but have not yet begun
    the awakening process. Often times Vampires are drawn to vampiric things, but
    they don't realize what they already are. This spell will help you achieve full
    awakening to your true self.

  prefs: []

- en: This is a fake spell, vampires in this way are not real and you cannot become
    a different creature with magick or awaken a mythical creature inside yourself,
    it simply isn't how it works.

- en: Madisyn, vampire spells do not work and will never work, vampires do not exist
    and you cannot become one with or without magick (unless you are just playing
    dress up). You are human and will always be. No matter how long you wait, you
    will not become one.

- en: You are human, you cannot become a vampire. Vampires as seen in popular culture
    are not physical beings, ergo you are not one.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: considering that vampire spells don't work since you can't become a vampire,
    I'd say the only side effect would probably be the energy of the spell having
    nowhere to go and hanging around.

- en: First off, nice to see another Genshin fan [love Itto] But, to answer your question,
    no. As Draq said, vampire spells aren't real [specifically spells claiming to
    turn you into a physical blood-sucking vampire] Side effects from these spells
    are usually psychosomatic [placebo effect] or the result of charging a bunch of
    energy that has nowhere to go [because you can't physically transform] and the
    energy just bounces around your home for a while, effecting you, making you feel
    sick/unwell, until the energy fades away. You might want to look into psi vampires.
    You can also try working with astral vampires, deities associated with vampires,
    using vampire imagery in your craft, or working with blood magick [but be careful
    with blood magick. Not because it's powerful and taboo, but because you could
    get an infection. Use a diabetic needle to prick your finger and only use a drop.
    You don't need a lot of blood, and you should NEVER slice your hand open for a
    spell]
