 Wind: (You must be outside for this to work to its full potential.) Get into a comfortable position outside with your back straight. Have your item held in both of your hands. Now you will relax and take SEVEN deep breaths. You will start to focus yourself on the wind around you and the energy it carries. Focus on the wind until you feel you've completely honed in on the energy. At that moment you will start to retract the energy into your body. You will then move the wind energy into your stomach. Once the energy is there you must infuse some of your energy into the raw energy of the wind. After you infuse your energy you will then move the energy through your body and thru your hands into the item. Imagine that you're sewing the energy into the item. After you feel you've done this long enough slowly stop your connection with the wind until you've completely stopped.

Message me if you'd like instructions on Water, Earth, or Fire.
