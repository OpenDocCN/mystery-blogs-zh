# Elemental Dragon Invocation Ritual - Witchy Wisdom - The Spells8 Forum

Below is a dragon calling invocation ritual that I found online. This is the one I used last night to invite the Elemental Dragons into my circle.
J’Karrah EbonDragon doesn’t specify which oils or incenses to use, but I plan to use Dragon’s Blood in the future. If anyone has any other suggestions for what I can use, I’d love to hear them!

**Dragon Invocation Ritual**
By J’Karrah EbonDragon

I recommend that this ritual be performed at least once a month. Arrange your altar with a small votive candle, a pinch of salt, spiritual oil, and incense.

Light the candle, sprinkle with a little salt and place 9-13 drops of oil carefully on the candle.

Light the incense.

Face the altar and raise your hands in salute. Say: *”Hail to the Great Dragon of the Spiritual Realms, those who rule over all!*
*I greet you this day in honor, strength and joy!*
*Cleanse my body; mind and spirit that I may bring honor and glory to my clan, to dragon kind, and to myself as I go about my daily activities.*

Face the East, Say:
*“Hail to the Great Dragon of the East, you who control the Element of Air,*
*I greet you this day in honor, strength and joy!*
*Bless me this day with inspiration, mental clarity, and a keen mind!”*

Face the South, Say:
*“Hail to the Great Dragon of the South, you who control the Element of Fire,*
*I greet you this day in honor, strength and joy!*
*Bless me this day with passion, strength, and courage!”*

Face the West, Say:
*“Hail to the Great Dragon of the West, you who control the Element of Water,*
*I greet you this day in honor, strength and joy!*
*Bless me this day with transformation, tranquility, and self-honor!”*

Face the North, Say:
*“Hail to the Great Dragon of the North, you who control the Element of Earth,*
*I greet you this day in honor, strength and joy!*
*Bless me this day with stability, insight, and prosperity in all things!”*

Return to the center and say:
*“Great Dragons, those who have joined with me in peace and trust, I thank you for your guidance, your love and your friendship. I will always strive to be worthy of all three! So mote it be!”*
