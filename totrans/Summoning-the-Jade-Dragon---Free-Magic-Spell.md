I took a trip to China with a few druids and we performed this spell.
The Jade Dragon was beautiful hopefully you'll be aloud to see.

Never heard of a jade Dragon, but you could try summoning it. If this is a physical Dragon they claim to have seen, no, Dragons are astral beings. Try it and see I guess.

It might be a spiritual dragon, but I am not going to travel to china to find out, too expensive.

You cannot summon a physical dragon. Also, the description warns of consequences, yet the bottom brags about how amazing it was. What are these consequences, because it simply raises more flags for me to claim danger exist and yet never elaborate.
