# Ancestral Wish: Easily Modifiable

A simple wish spell to get a small thing by help of Ancestors

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Ancestral Wish: Easily Modifiable'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 Wish related item

*   1 Moonblessed item (item charged by moon and not exposed to direct light)

*   1 broken item

*   1 piece of tape

*   1 Wish

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 Wish related item

*   1 Moonblessed item (item charged by moon and not exposed to direct light)

*   1 broken item

*   1 piece of tape

*   1 Wish

 Meditate and cleanse. Then sit cross legged with person whose wish you are fulfilling. Set out the object for the Wish and have your family member put their finger on the part of the object that will help most with their Wish. Ask them to state it out loud clearly. Then hold the moonblessed item to your lips and chant for your favorite ancestor an ancestor very important to your family to help grant the Wish. Then seal the broken item with tape and state that until the piece breaks the Wish will have to come true. If it doesn’t come true by then your ancestors may not want to help you fulfill this. Finally keep the items all in a dark space. 

***Do not attempt to do for yourself. If you do the spell might backfire badly. This is only to be done as kindness for others. Seal the spell once your Wish is gotten by a prayer to your Ancestor**. **This is to be kind to them. Do not ask for help of the living. And be respectful of them and also gift them rewards if you like to!***
