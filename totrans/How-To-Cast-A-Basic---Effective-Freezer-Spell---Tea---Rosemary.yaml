- en: The freezer spell is one of the most well-known spells in witchcraft, and is
    even used by non-practitioners. It has some seriously deep roots in Hoodoo, but
    was even used in religious communities. It’s *easy*, and it *works*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe you have a terrible boss who won’t leave you alone, or an ex who continues
    to cause issues, or maybe someone you used to be friends with is gossiping about
    you behind your back. Whatever your case is, this is the perfect spell if you
    need to *stop* someone in their tracks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A freezer spell will literally “freeze” the person in their tracks and will
    keep them far away from you. The person won’t contact you as much (or at all,
    if it was super effective) and won’t be able to hurt you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also possible to cast this spell for someone else. If someone is hurting
    a loved one, you can cast it with the intention of working on your target and
    get the same effects.

- en: Why Choose a Freezer Spell?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like the freezer spell because it helps get rid of difficult people without
    casting [hexes and jinxes](https://teaandrosemary.com/curses-hexes-and-jinxes-whats-the-difference/)
    on anyone. If you don’t want to actually hurt anyone, but do want to stop bad
    behavior, a freezer spell is a great option.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The freezer spell is also a really easy spell for beginners. It’s a good go-to
    because you probably already have the materials you need and it doesn’t take long
    to cast.

- en: How Does The Freezer Spell Work?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The spell will freeze the intended person out of your life, but it may work
    in odd, unexpected ways. I once tried to freeze a friend’s boss, but my friend
    ended up getting temporary medical leave after her health worsened.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The boss wasn’t specifically fired and didn’t want to stay away from my friend,
    but she was forced to stay away (due to paid medical leave) until my friend was
    paid and she was able to find another job. So theoretically, this spell worked,
    but my friend had asked me to cast it so that she could keep that specific job.
    In that sense, the freezer spell backfired.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this reason, I only do this spell when the situation is dire enough to warrant
    it. You never know exactly what will happen, but if you *really* never want to
    see this person again, then it’s worth a try. You should be willing to rid your
    life of the individual at all costs. If that doesn’t sound good to you, then you
    may want to try something different than a freezer spell.

- en: Make sure that when you choose a target for your freezer spell, you’re fine
    with never seeing the person again. Don’t cast this on your in-laws, for example,
    if you want your kids to have a relationship with their grandparents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also shouldn’t cast this spell on someone you’re in a fight with or you
    might never make up. In fact, you probably won’t even speak again. You need to
    be absolutely sure that this person contributes nothing but harm to your life
    before casting the freezer spell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an effective spell and it’s hard to reverse, so choose wisely!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re unsure, I recommend doing some shadow work before casting the spell.
    I talk more about that, and spell planning in general, [**on the Patreon.**](https://www.patreon.com/teaandrosemary)
    Ultimately, the most important part of the spell is actually the planning – that’s
    how you set yourself up for success. If you don’t have the right intention, the
    spell simply won’t work.

    baggie, too. You can also use a Tupperware container, a freezer-proof jar, or
    anything that feels right to you. The only necessity is that it completely seals.'

    A freezer spell is powerful magic!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this spell does fail, I recommend looking *very* closely into your motives
    and emotional state when casting the freezer spell. It’s hard to go wrong with
    the ingredients, so the culprit is typically your own energy, unless the universe
    is blocking you.

    means that the energy wasn’t strong enough to last and that you need to recharge
    it.
  prefs: []

- en: Take the bag out of the freezer for an hour or so and let it melt. Once the
    ice is defrosted, chant something similar to what you said initially (above) and
    place the bag back in the freezer. Try to focus your energy even more intensely.
    You can do this as many times as needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    hold for quite a bit, but if the person is causing a stink again, then it’s definitely
    time to do a recharge.

    who put her daughter’s boyfriend in the freezer, but months later he showed back
    up, proving that he was reformed. Her daughter refused to get back together with
    him. The very guilty mother had to quickly reverse the freezer spell, and then
    her daughter was suddenly amenable.

    situation is resolved, you’ll need to get that baggie out of your freezer. Maybe
    you’re moving, getting a new freezer, or just trying to reorganize. Regardless,
    it’s impractical to hang on to a freezer spell forever.

    resolved for *some time.* There shouldn’t be any doubt in your mind that it worked.
    Once your intuition tells you it’s time, go ahead and dispose of the freezer spell.
