 Sit/lay/or stand in your undisturbed area. If you are interrupted it's okay, just start over again after they leave. Close your eyes and imagine a spark in your chest area. Soon your stomach or heart will start to feel a bit warmer. Take control of this feeling and imagine the spark growing into a blaze inside of you. If it doesn't work right away try again, it can take a few times.

Maybe try reaching out with your fire like it's a hand and warm something up with it. You can't pick anything up or move anything since it is on your astral plane, not the physical one.

Please tell me how it works for you, this is my first posted spell.
