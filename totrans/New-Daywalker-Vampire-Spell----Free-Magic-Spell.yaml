    etc. ; bending the elements ; controlling the weather, is fake.

    they are far more likely to be fake.

    to put yourself in a very harmful manner. True magick is an energy field from
    nature's core given the fact that since magick is a neutral energy source that
    can be practiced by anyone doesnt mean it is able to turn the human body into
    a different form.
