  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Incorrect. Real Magik on the physical plane is a natural energy, ruled by nature,
    and undefiant of natural law. If a spell contradicts nature, it does not work
    on the physical plane. Physical change, transformation, transfiguration as seen
    in films is not in human nature, ergo no spell will create these results.

- en: Tadashi is correct. On different planes of existence magick can do more, but
    we live on the physical plane. On the physical plane, magick is in the domain
    of nature. Magick on the physical follows natural law. It brings natural change,
    and while you might be able to do more powerful things with practice [weather
    magick, illusions, ancestral curses] humans aren't the type of magickal being
    that can break natural law and do unnatural spells. Our realm has fairly strict
    rules. No amount of belief will change that fact.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can learn to use magick, but the energy has its limits on the physical.
    We are part of a large magickal ecosystem, and humans [while able to cast great
    spells] are fairly low on that food chain. Magick on the physical is a force of
    nature, it can't contradict nature being part of nature. Don't be so arrogant
    as to think we can bend things to our will. We are but small specks in the grand
    order of the universe. I suggest checking your ego, doing some shadow work and
    doing more research on magick and witchcraft.
