- en: From above to below Flows the pattern of perfection From desire to manifestation
    Flows the pattern of Magick From within to without Flows the pattern of my will
    Candle magick is probably one of the simplest forms of magick to get started with.
    You need nothing but the candle and fire to light it with. Candle magick can also
    be seen to be complete within itself, as the body of the candle is made up from
    the elements of Earth, Air and Water. To complete you need fire and spirit. Fire
    is easy, and Spirit can be represented by the wick of the candle, as the wick
    is where the potential of the candle lies and will be unfolded with. With the
    candle lit, the flame of your intent will burn.

  zh: 从上到下、完美的模式是由欲望到实现其中流动的；魔术的模式是由内而外其中流动的；蜡烛魔法可能是最简单的魔法形式之一。您只需要蜡烛和火就可以开始。蜡烛魔法也可以看作是完全完成了自身，因为蜡烛的主体由地、空气和水元素组成。要完成还需要火和精神。火很容易获得，而精神可以由蜡烛的灯芯来代表，因为灯芯是蜡烛的潜力所在，也将随着燃烧而展现。蜡烛点燃后，你的愿望之焰将燃起。
- en: Candle Magic has been used for centuries for magick and ritual. We light candles
    at holidays, a practice that takes place in many different religions, cultures
    and traditions. Candles invoke the divine, they create a sense of ceremony and
    they are facinating to look at. Candles can be purchased anywhere, by anyone without
    anyone blinking an eye or suspecting magick and witchcraft! Through their ability
    to help you to focus on your wishes they make your heart's desire come true. Try
    it next time you want to make something happen in your life! Below is a few simple
    guidelines for using candles in magick! Unwittingly you probably performed your
    first act of Candle Magick when you where very young on your birthday, blowing
    out the candles on your cake and making a wish! This tradition is based on the
    three principals of magick; being concentration, will power and visualization.
    You have to concentrate to blow the candles out, wish and see your dream coming
    true - absolute magick!

  zh: 选购蜡烛时的重要指针：
- en: Choose a plain candle, of uniform shape. Having unusual or large candles can
    be distracting and is therefore not suitable for magickal use. Candles used for
    magick should always be Virgin (unused) at the start of the ritual. Using secondhand
    candles or other materials in magick can have disastrous effects as they might
    have picked up vibrations from previous use, even if it was just on a dinner table!
    It is a very good idea to make your own candles if they are for magickal use.
    It will increase the magickal potency of the candle many times. It is very easy
    to make your own candles, simply heat the wax until liquid and pour it into a
    mould which is treaded with a wick. The wax should now be left to cool, after
    which the mould can be removed. Oils and colours can be added to the Wax for extra
    effects. Charge your candle before using it in ritual. This can be done by annointing
    it with oils associated with the ritual or magick you intend on performing, or
    by simply touching it and charging it with your own energy. Whilst charging the
    candle, visualixe the North and South Poles - rub the oil into the candle starting
    at either the North or South end and always brush in the same direction. The oils
    used in the annointing of your candle should where possible always be natural
    fragrances. Try to colour the candles according the the colour associations below.
