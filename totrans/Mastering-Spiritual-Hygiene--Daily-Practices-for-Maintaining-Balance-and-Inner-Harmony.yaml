- en: Before I delved into the concept of spiritual hygiene, I was unaware of how
    much our spiritual well-being impacts our daily lives. **Spiritual hygiene refers
    to the practices and rituals that help maintain a healthy spiritual ecosystem.**
    Just like brushing your teeth or taking a shower, it's about regular maintenance
    to prevent the build-up of negative energy.

    what resonated with me the most. I've discovered that there are a lot of things
    one can do, so I recommend starting by **keeping a journal** to keep track of
    what works best for you in your own personal life situation. Aside from a journal
    helping you to recognize patterns and areas that need attention, it can also be
    used as a form of mental and emotional decluttering to keep your spiritual house
    in order.
