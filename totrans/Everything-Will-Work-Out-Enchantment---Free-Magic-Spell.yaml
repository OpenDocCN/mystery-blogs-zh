- en: I was writing this spell while I was hyped up on adrenaline. My friends' and
    I's movie plans were almost ruined because of me and while I was calming down,
    I decided to sit down and write a spell. I didn't have time to do much research
    so I mostly went off of my own knowledge and what materials I had nearby. This
    is mainly a spell to have things turn out in your favor with also a dash of luck.
    Once the small vial/jar is done, I suggest trying it to a bag or item that you
    usually carry around with you, I usually tuck this jar into my backpack.

- en: 'Why I chose these materials: I didn''t have much reason for technically making
    this into a jar spell. I only had a jar nearby, thought it would be convenient
    and easy to carry around. It was also the same for the origami stars, they also
    symbolized soaring free and escaping troubles. The stars can be any color, mine
    are various neon colors, but I suggest making them yellow or white to symbolize
    pureness and optimism. The blue yarn is tied around the jar in order to center
    the energies inside and to also symbolize steadfastness and stability. I also
    believe that blue has a calming influence. The green papers are just to sprinkle
    in extra luck.'

    that is required is that they fit in the jar/vial that you will be using. Before
    starting any spellwork, make sure to center, ground, and cast a circle.

    Remember to close the circle you've cast and thank any spirits or deities that
    took part in this enchantment with you. I also suggest leaving your jar out overnight
    in the moonlight, to charge it even more with power, the mindfulness, and stillness
    energy the moon gives off.
