- en: Retrograde is a really cool concept in astrology. Contrary to popular belief,
    it does not mean that the planet starts moving in the opposite direction. It is,
    in fact, an *apparent* change in the movement of the planet with respect to our
    vantage point that is, the Earth.

    been misunderstood and put in a negative light. It is crucial we remember that
    this is as much a part of nature as prograde is. The underlying message these
    celestial bodies send us is that a period of resting and recharging is just as
    important as moving forward is. They also remind us that we need time to reassess
    and reposition ourselves – and what we want from life.
