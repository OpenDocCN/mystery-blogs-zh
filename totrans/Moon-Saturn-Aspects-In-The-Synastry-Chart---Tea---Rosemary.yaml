- en: In astrology, Saturn is the serious, mature individual, while the Moon is the
    inner, emotional self. These two are virtual opposites, so in the synastry chart,
    Saturn-Moon aspects can be quite difficult.

    in your synastry chart with your partner, you’ll know that you have an opportunity

    and reserved, while the Moon person can be over-emotional or childlike. It’s easy
    for the Saturn person to feel overwhelmed by the emotional nature of their partner,
    yet the Moon person can also feel emotionally oppressed.

    are unhappy, they’re often drawn to stay together. Saturn creates long-term relationships.

    of both people.

    both people are in terms of managing their own emotions and needs.

    won’t trigger Saturn as much.

    emotional balance, self-sufficiency, and how to better explain and obtain what
    they need emotionally. They can also learn how to balance their own emotional
    needs with those of their partner.
