I love that name, short, simple, and straight to the point!

This will not work. If it did it would make you an arsonist. Burning someone's property is a crime.

A crime for those who live by laws that prevent them from doing it. If you live by your own rules, anything is possible. Not saying it would work in this level of reality or in the exact manner the spell intends, of course.

A crime is literally something punishable by law, so whether you live by your own rules or not, it's still a crime, Nyarlath. (Also, it kind of sounds like you're saying arson is okay? I'm not saying you are, I'm just pointing out that your comment could come across that way.)

am going to try this and tell you if it worked ok
