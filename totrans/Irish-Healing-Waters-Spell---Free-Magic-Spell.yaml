- en: Take equal parts of lavender, violet, and rosemary. Empower them and then boil
    them in a pot with about a quart of water over medium heat. When the water is
    richly colored and the herbs are scenting your kitchen, drain the water off into
    a jar. A plain coffee filter works great for this. Place the jar in sunlight for
    an entire day to absorb the radiant energies of the sun. (You can do this on a
    Wednesday to add the healing powers of mercury to the spell). Occasionally look
    at the jar and add your own energies to it. Just before sundown fetch the jar
    and hold it firmly between your hands just below your naval. Feel your desire
    to be well filling the jar and with your minds eye see it glowing brightly as
    the sun. Chant these words until you have filled the jar with as much energy as
    it will hold.
