- en: Mercury is the planet that rules the mind, thought processes, and communication
    style in Astrology.  It tells us not what we think about, but how we think. Mercury
    is the closest planet to the sun, and moves the fastest. It may be difficult to
    differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is the persona, and Mercury
    is the mind.

- en: Pisces and Mercury do not get along. Mercury does not like to be in Pisces,
    where it is in fall and detriment. Pisces is scattered, unorganized, and illogical,
    and mercury is the mind– so it is no secret as to why these two do not get along
    very well.

- en: Mercury in Pisces people are usually pretty confused. They tend to think of
    life as a work of art, rather than something that needs to be lived. Mercury in
    Pisces individuals are highly intuitive, but their intuition is almost always
    clouded by their self-deception.

- en: One Mercury in Pisces individual that I know once told me that every time she
    gets out of bed in the morning, she narrates her life as if she’s the main character.
    This is the kind of artistic thinking that clouds the mind of the Mercury in Pisces
    individual, and makes life kind of misty.

- en: 'Life is a storybook for Mercury in Pisces, and they are the main character.
    They may make up fake storylines in their head: conversations with people that
    they are never going to have, or love stories that won’t actually happen. These
    are all part of their own personal dramatic retelling of their story.'

- en: Sometimes, these fake realities feel better and more real to a Mercury in Pisces
    person than their own life. Self-deception can easily set in, and they can become
    entirely delusional, preferring to live in their own made up world than the real
    one. I urge Mercury in Pisces people to try only to fantasize about the good things
    that already exist, rather than creating entirely new ones.
  prefs: []

- en: Alternatively, sometimes Mercury in Pisces may manifest as fears that are impossible.
    Because these people have a hard time living in the real world, they are unable
    to logically remember that these fears are not likely to be actualized. This can
    develop into anxiety disorders, OCD, or other fear preventative disorders. I urge
    Mercury in Pisces people to try to realize how likely these things are to actually
    occur, and to ease their mind with their inherent trust in the universe.

- en: Mercury in Pisces’ thoughts are loose and not very organized compared to other
    Mercury Placements. They are not detail oriented, and often focus more on the
    *mood* of what is going on than on what is actually going on. They pick up on
    the subtleties of what is going on around them, and are extremely affected by
    the atmosphere.

    the Mercury in Pisces person often gets psychic messages and intuition through
    dreams, even if they cannot figure out the message.

    to escape them entirely. This kind of escapism can lead to seeking refuge in fantasy,
    checking out from the real world, and even addictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to not developing this kind of escapism is finding some kind of outlet
    in the real world, either through art, music, photography, or other kinds of creative
    expression.

    soft spoken or shy, but really they do not want to hurt anyone by being loud or
    abrasive. These people are incredibly good listeners, and are very fun to be around.
  prefs: []

- en: They love having a drink and a laugh, and have very theatrical humor which comes
    off well to other people. In a conversation, they may act as though they are a
    protagonist playing out a storyline. It is better to let them have their fun,
    as they don’t mean, nor do they often hurt anyone.
  prefs: []

- en: These people, while shy and quiet, are very warm and want everyone to feel safe
    and comfortable. Whatever opinions they may have, they usually keep to themselves
    in social situations. Unlike Mercury in Libra who keeps quiet to keep friends,
    Mercury in Pisces keeps quiet because they actually don’t want to hurt anyone.

- en: Mercury in Pisces has incredible compassion for humans and animals alike. They
    may feel that they have just as in depth and meaningful conversations with animals
    as they do with people. This is because Mercury in Pisces is less concerned with
    the *content* of the conversation, and much more concerned with the *feelings*
    that the conversation evokes.

    forgiving, especially if Mars is in a mutable sign. Mercury in Pisces harbor no
    jealousy, and just want everyone to get along.

    is caring and empathetic, though she can be a bit confused sometimes. She is typically
    gracious and polite, though if Mercury is negatively afflicted, she may be avoidant
    instead.

    He changes his mind easily and is very impressionable, especially by the women
    in his life.
  prefs: []

    man may come up with ideas the world has never seen before, and is an out of the
    box thinker. His intuition guides him to new discoveries and ideas. He may make
    revolutionary changes in music and art, but uses these things as a means and outlet
    to discover his own mind.

    one person at a time.
