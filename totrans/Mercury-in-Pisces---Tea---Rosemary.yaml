- en: Mercury is the planet that rules the mind, thought processes, and communication
    style in Astrology.  It tells us not what we think about, but how we think. Mercury
    is the closest planet to the sun, and moves the fastest. It may be difficult to
    differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is the persona, and Mercury
    is the mind.

  zh: 水星是占星学中统治思维、思维过程和沟通风格的行星。它告诉我们的不是我们思考什么，而是我们如何思考。水星是离太阳最近的行星，也是运行速度最快的行星。区分这两者可能有些困难，但请记住：太阳是外在表象，而水星则是思想。

- en: Pisces and Mercury do not get along. Mercury does not like to be in Pisces,
    where it is in fall and detriment. Pisces is scattered, unorganized, and illogical,
    and mercury is the mind– so it is no secret as to why these two do not get along
    very well.

  zh: 双鱼座和水星并不相容。水星不喜欢在双鱼座，因为它在那里既是跌落又是削弱。双鱼座是散漫、无组织和不合逻辑的，而水星是思维的代表——所以这两者为何不太合拍已不是秘密。
- en: Mercury in Pisces people are usually pretty confused. They tend to think of
    life as a work of art, rather than something that needs to be lived. Mercury in
    Pisces individuals are highly intuitive, but their intuition is almost always
    clouded by their self-deception.

- en: Sometimes, these fake realities feel better and more real to a Mercury in Pisces
    person than their own life. Self-deception can easily set in, and they can become
    entirely delusional, preferring to live in their own made up world than the real
    one. I urge Mercury in Pisces people to try only to fantasize about the good things
    that already exist, rather than creating entirely new ones.

  zh: 有时候，对水瓶座的水星的人来说，这些虚假的现实感觉比他们自己的生活更好、更真实。自我欺骗很容易产生，他们可能完全陷入妄想之中，宁愿生活在他们自己编造的世界里，而不是真实的世界中。我劝水瓶座的水星的人只
    fantasize 关于已经存在的美好事物，而不是创造全新的事物。
- en: Alternatively, sometimes Mercury in Pisces may manifest as fears that are impossible.
    Because these people have a hard time living in the real world, they are unable
    to logically remember that these fears are not likely to be actualized. This can
    develop into anxiety disorders, OCD, or other fear preventative disorders. I urge
    Mercury in Pisces people to try to realize how likely these things are to actually
    occur, and to ease their mind with their inherent trust in the universe.
