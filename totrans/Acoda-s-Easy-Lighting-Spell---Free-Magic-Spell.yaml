- en: Take a nighttime stroll through a street with lights at the side of the road.
    Chances are, at least a few of those lamps are broken. Find a broken one that
    calls out to you and point your finger at the lightless bulb. Concentrate on the
    thought of the lamp glowing, and then lighting up. Just saying ''Light'' repeatedly
    helps but if a full length, rhyming spell would help you fell free to make one
    up yourself.

- en: i have cast many spells over many years, and i can think of one one time my
    energy effected a lightbulb [and i'm still on the fence it wasn't just the lightbulb
    having terrible timing in an attempt to scare me and/or give me an amazing story
    to tell people] in theory focusing your energy on an energy like the eletricity
    in a lightbulb could work, but magickal energy and electrical energy are different.
    i know of people who do something similar with candle flames [or so i'm told]
    i'm highly skeptical this would work on electrical lights, but i don't see any
    real harm in trying [outside of wasting your time and energy]
