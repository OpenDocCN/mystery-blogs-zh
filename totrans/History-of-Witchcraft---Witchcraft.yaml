- en: Some claim that witchcraft dates back to [**pre-history**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-ancient/).
    Others allege that what we generally consider witchcraft developed in pre-Christian
    Celtic times. Either way, the best known period in the history of witchcraft is
    the late [**Middle Ages**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-medieval/)
    and [**Early Modern**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-early-modern/)
    period during which time hundreds of thousands of (alleged) witches were tried
    and tens of thousands burned by the Christian authorities in Europe’s infamous
    [**witch trials**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/trials/). It was
    only in the [**20th Century**](http://witchcraftandwitches.com/witchcraft/history-modern/)
    that witchcraft saw a resurgence.
