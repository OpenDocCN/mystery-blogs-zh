To create a demon, you must do these steps specifically, if you don’t want it to kill you. First, name it’s traits. Make sure you don’t say anything bad about it, or that trait will grow, and grow, or else it might use that trait to kill you.

Next, write their traits on a piece of paper. Now, write LOVE NOT HATE on the piece of paper with black marker. Tear the paper apart. You will then be given a sign that the demon is there.

If anything goes wrong, tell it you’ not afraid, then it will parish. If no demon is created, try again. Voila. You have a demon.
