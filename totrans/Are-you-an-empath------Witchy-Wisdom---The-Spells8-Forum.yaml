- en: Many, many people that are interested in New Age concepts or pagan religions
    tend to be empaths. **But what is an empath?** An empath is *one who experiences
    the emotions of others* . You may be able to read the room and know what happened,
    or you may be in a crowd full of people and experience sadness, anger, or even
    panic, for no apparent reason. Empaths come from all walks of life, but it is
    often those who are more open to the world around them that experience it the
    most.

- en: Here are several common traits of empaths to help you determine if you might
    be one. Keep in mind that **just because you may experience some of these traits
    does not necessarily mean you are an empath.** Some traits of an empath can be
    learned - like reading the energy in a room - and some are innate.

- en: This is the most common trait of an empath. Since an empath can feel the emotions
    of others, it often happens that they will experience them as well. An empath
    may match anger with someone they are arguing with, they may match sadness with
    someone they are close to, or they may even **match panic and anxiety of anyone
    in the area**.

    motive. Nature has no emotions, She just *is.* Being outdoors and among the living
    plants and animals is a peaceful experience to the empath and can help calm any
    unwanted emotions they may be carrying.

    it is said that **they are more creative**. They have the ability to tap into
    the creative aspect of themselves and create art, sing, dance, and many other
    forms of creative expression to help them cope with the sometimes overwhelming
    feelings of everyone around them.

    someone is being honest or knowing a fact without having all the evidence. **They
    are more attuned with the energies around them** as well as their own gut feeling.
    The stronger these abilities are, the stronger the knowing.

- en: Since empaths can take on the emotions of others, being somewhere that has a
    large group of people can be debilitating for an empath that does not know how
    to shield themselves. This is often found in empaths who are denying who they
    are, or in empaths who have not learned proper energy work. At times, even with
    the proper techniques, public **places can still be overwhelming with the amount
    of emotion held there**.

    any form of violence or tragedy can be **too much for the empath to bear**. This
    could be anything from a street fight to terrorism, and it will all depend on
    the empath. Watching the terror and fear play across the faces of those affected
    may be something the empath can’t handle.

    ailments of those close to them in a form of sympathy pain**. The best example
    I can think of - that has nothing to do with being an empath - is someone having
    the same pains as a pregnant person. Feeling sympathy pains is like that for the
    empath, but with any pain or ailment.

    to offload their problems onto an empath with unoccupied ears, and the empath
    will probably listen. **They understand and feel the need for the other person
    to unload their emotional baggage** to make them lighter, and the empath naturally
    wants to help.

    a place of solitude to go and recharge.** This can be a place to meditate, journal,
    listen to music, or even just a quiet bath alone. This time of solitude is vital
    to the empath so they do not get overloaded with the emotions of others.

    empaths develop a natural protection method without even knowing it, but developing
    this protection more will lead to an easier time in crowds and functioning daily.
    There are several ways this can be done, and they all take practice.

    in public places is the most common way to protect yourself from unwanted emotional
    attacks. This can be as simple as a wall of energy or - if you are more advanced
    in your energy work - can be layer upon layer of protective barriers.

    of your body. This energy can be whatever color you want, but the most common
    is white. See this bubble as flowy - *like rippling water* - moving in and out
    from you as it pleases. Now, focus on bringing this bubble closer to you, keeping
    it from rippling around and grabbing the energy of others. Harden your shield
    and command it to stay put and protect you.

    and the constant barrage of societal pressure present in today’s world.
