- en: These types of spells usually have a lot to do with this person's Aura. Their
    aura is the atmospheric energy surrounding this person. The aura is usually a
    color, such as green, blue, black white, etc. Certain ones have certain meanings
    in their nature at that moment, and this will tell you what colors to look out
    for and how to see auras.

- en: Pay attention to this energy. What color do you see in it? If their aura is
    blue, white, purple, or light red, they are most likely telling the truth or just
    very happy. If it is black, dark red, or dark green, they are half and half. They
    may be uncertain themselves if you see these colors. If it is light green, yellow,
    brown, or orange, they're probably lying to you.

    to do. I have no clue as to do this do you have any information or things I can
    do to make this something I'm able to do easily?

- en: Start with meditating and energy work to get use to feeling the flow of energy
    and clearing your mind. When you feel ready to see auras there are a number of
    techniques you can try. Personally I just look a little past a person [say their
    shoulders or head] and slowly I begin to see a glowing outline appear. You can
    also try by holding your hand/arm a few inches away from a solid coloured wall
    and staring slightly above it. Don't unfocus your eyes, but try and focus between
    your arm and the wall.

- en: I'm still new to reading auras but from what I can tell you practice it with
    a candle flame. they're the most easiest. you have to clear you mind, and look
    for a white light. and once you're able to see them, you'll see a white or any
    color of electric waves around the flame.

    and it's the most difficult thing I have ever learned to control. SOme auras are
    stronger than others and can be incredibly distracting and painful.

    can tell mood or health, but you would have better luck studying body language.

- en: mr tadashi, the fact that you are raised a wiccan doesn't mean you know more
    than the real spell creator
  prefs: []

- en: I never said it did, however being raised Wiccan, I was taught by practicing
    Witches from a young age. Meaning, I have more experience in the craft and can
    tell when a spell will or will not work. Reading over this spell, it requires
    work. That is why I explained aura's. They are not an automatic lie detector.
    Regarding the person who posted this would know more, that is a falsehood. Anyone
    can post anything on the internet, and with little evidence to prove their claims.
    Witchcraft is especially susceptible to this since it is so open. Not to mention
    many people join the craft after growing up with witches and magic in movies and
    fairytales so their expectations are the opposite of what Real Magik is and is
    capable of. You can determine a persons energy/emotions by seeing their aura but
    it is not a guaranteed lie detector.

    white auras. Sometimes I can see things or objects glowing

    from the colour of aura. however, it might not always be true.
