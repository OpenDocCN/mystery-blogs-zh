    each element. This one will serve as the introduction to the topic. It is one
    of the [core types of Wiccan magic](https://craftofwicca.com/understanding-the-different-types-of-wiccan-magic/).

    to nature, for it will do perfectly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    picks up the bundled rosemary and flower petals. She takes these tools to her
    bedroom.

    a spell are the least important part. This might be shocking to some readers.

    sound frustrating. How do you know what this even is if the spell doesn’t say
    it?

    a luck charm out of aventurine.
  prefs: []

    Earth, the element of luck and prosperity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    start with this intent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the energy within yourself and focus it through the visualization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    hand and say the words to focus your visualization and energy. Feel it flow out
    of you and into the gem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is known as “charging.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    now gone out into the world. If your intentions were true and pure, you should
    receive the natural gifts back.
