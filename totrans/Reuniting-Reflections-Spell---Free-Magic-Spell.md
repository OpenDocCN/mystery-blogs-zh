The power of the mirror can help you reunite with your loved one.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Reuniting Reflections Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A mirror

*   Piece of paper and pen

*   Pieces of rose quartz, carnelian, red jasper and/or garnet

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A mirror

*   Piece of paper and pen

*   Pieces of rose quartz, carnelian, red jasper and/or garnet

Use fine linen paper and a good quality ink pen for this spell.

Write your name out in full, and below it write the full name of your missing lover. Now you need to place the paper and mirror so they face each other (more or less). Tip the mirror downwards a bit so it's facing the paper but don't prop up the paper. A makeup mirror on a tilt-able stand works great.

Place your crystals over both names, and repeat the following chant:

Mirror, mirror do you see?
Bring my lover back to me.

You should hear news of your returning loved one soon. Now these spells will really only be successful if you use them on another person who already loves you (or has loved you).
