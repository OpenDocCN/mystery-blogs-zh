    its safe!) or by placing the candles on your altar. Please keep the candles away
    from all things flammable and in a fire proof dish.

    If you have trouble with this try using the search bar to search for tips. You
    can also find guided meditations on youtube. At this point you should be laying
    with the paper under your head.

    when you feel a tingling senstation on your third eye chakra try moving your hand
    through a solid surface nearby. Please remember! Even getting this very tip of
    your figure through the solid surface can take many attempts.

    unsure which this user is referring to, but if you think you can physically walk
    through walls you cannot, it defies nature, therefore it does not work.

    penetrating a wall . :-)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: True. But that is not one of the ingredients for this spell. This specific spell
    does not work. But, a sledge hammer can indeed help you walk through a wall. Make
    sure it is not a load bearing wall.
