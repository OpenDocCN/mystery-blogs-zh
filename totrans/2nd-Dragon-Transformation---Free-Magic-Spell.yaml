- en: Nothing because you cannot become a different species with magick. Magick cannot
    turn you into a shapeshifter, it cannot alter your genetics or change your physical
    form. If you are interested in dragons I would suggest staying clear of transformation
    spells, as they are fake and look into working with dragonic spirits and energies
    instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another one in case the last one didn't work? None of them will work because
    you can't physically transform into a Dragon. I'd say keep trying but we've got
    enough fake spells on this site, we don't need more.

    and what it does, and seem to have no end to the things you can find wrong with
    every spell. If you think there are really a lot of fake spells, then just leave!
    find something else more real than our ''fake'' spells and our ''fake'' magic!
    Nobody needs your negativity! They can make what spells they want, and magic can
    be what it wants! If certain spells work for them,then so be it!!! Let them share
    their success, and let other people try it too! This person here wanted to make
    something, and you came over and had to be Mr. high and mighty,so you crushed
    his dreams! Kingdragon came here for advice from the experts and you both are
    crushing his dreams! I came here for escape and magic, and lo and behold it's
    the same s##t I see every day in reality! Go find someone elses life and ruin
    it!!!

- en: People point out which spells are fake in order to help people, Kingdom. Beginners
    come on wanting to cast, but get sucked into these fake spells and waste years
    on them. Desperate people with physical and mental illness find fake spells that
    claim to be cure-alls or grant immortality, and it would be morally wrong to allow
    them to get sucked into a time-waster when they could be spending time actually
    treating their condition. People post spells like these without thinking of the
    potential consequences of how acting like spells like these work hurts people.
    Nekoshema and HearthWitch aren't hurting people, they're providing genuine advice
    and help. You say that Kingdragon came for advice from the experts only to have
    his dreams crushed, but let's think about that--if people who have been practicing
    for a long time who know what they're doing say it doesn't work, perhaps they're
    not crushing anyone's dreams. Perhaps they're just right. If you want to spend
    time casting fake spells go right ahead, but don't get mad at people for telling
    the truth.

- en: for the record, i don't go around hating on others, crushing dreams, and being
    negative. if you go through the spells i also comment on plenty of working ones,
    i point out why they work, and if they're incomplete, i add ways they can be improved.
    the issue is the majority of the spells people care about are the fake ones, so
    people are focusing in on those experiences and colouring me in a negative light.
    [kind of like how people have a bias and only look at the examples that prove
    them right, and not the greater number of times they're disproven] anyway, i'm
    not finding any joy ''crushing peoples dreams'' i'm stating facts. do you yell
    at a teacher who explains 2+2=4 and not 5? do you yell at a doctor who explains
    why vaccines are safe or a scientist who explains the earth is round? i am simply
    trying to teach what magick can and can't do because unlike in the movies, it
    doesn't do everything people think it does. [regarding this response i was being
    snarky because i had commented on the previous spells explaining why it doesn't
    work] if you want the explanation, magick is an energy, it effects energy, it
    doesn't contradict nature and cause physical changes to occur. Dragons are astral
    beings [like spirits] that we can call on for guidance, we don't fuse with, transform
    into, or control Dragons, just as we don't control deities, or command faeries,
    or transform into werewolves. we still exist on the physical plane, and have the
    limitations of the physical to deal with. if you want to run away to a fantasy
    land where everything is possible, look into astral projection. [also, no swearing,
    even bleeping it out is against site rules and can get you gagged]

- en: Nekoshema please try to more polite when talking about fake spells because some
    people may not take it lightly with the way you say it. I can understand your
    point but please be more gentle because of upcoming spell casters. Rather than
    saying it straight up, say it as your point of view, it sounds more polite that
    way
  prefs: []

    ...It is at times unfortunate, but reality bends for no-one. And catering to the
    unreal does only harm. Even if it is for the sake of being 'nice, feeding a delusion
    only makes it more difficult for people to grow and better themselves.

- en: To hear it from an inside source; I have been involved with the Otherkin (and
    also Vampiric) communities for more than twenty years. A community specifically
    centered on the idea of non-human kinship/identity. Throughout that time I have
    been involved with countless explorations, conversations, debates, and spiritual
    exercises and journeys shared through many individuals including myself. In all
    that time one piece of information that has remained universally intact and accepted
    as true and valid is that Being a dragon, or elf or therian or vampiric or a walk-in
    or starchild or Indigo child... Is a thing you -**are**-. It is not a thing you
    become.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such a discovery is a function of identity, and coming to recognize/become aware
    of traits and associations that have always been present. Even then, there are
    different ways that people come in to this idea; A psychological association of
    personality and attitude (I think as a dragon, therefore I am a dragon), an idea
    of genetics and heredity (Somewhere waaaaaay back during evolutions process the
    genes of 'x' animal existed in my bloodline.... this one is largely debunked),
    and as a connection through one's spiritual past (I have lived as a dragon within
    a past life/between lives). ...Regardless of the model understood by the individual,
    it is revealed as a function of the individual's innate core nature. Something
    that does not change by simply saying a few words and thinking -really hard-.
    Such a change requires a rewrite of your instincts, predispositions, emotional
    connections, and the underlying mental process you use to connect with and understand
    the world around you. You would very literally need to be able to willfully and
    consciously make yourself into a completely different person emotionally, psychologically,
    and/or spiritually.

- en: All of that said, any individual can certainly explore ideas of energy working,
    meditation, and astral travel or shamanic journeying to explore and experience
    a draconic form, energy, and realm. And with effort, time, practice, exploration,
    and steady gradual immersion and connection with dragons and Draconic energy one
    could expand that connection into a change of attention and form as you learn
    to allow those energies to become a part of your nature. However this is a lifetimes
    long process akin to spiritual evolution. So it is not something achieved within
    the infinitely short period of a single human life- let alone one night with a
    candle and a prayer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a final note, even being a Draconic within a human body, you would still
    be human. Period. It is your physical form. It is where and how you live. Being
    a dragon does not change that. Nor does it make someone somehow special. Or powerful.
    Or important. Or 'better' than anyone else. ...People honestly take for granted
    just how much power humans have. People just spend all their effort convincing
    themselves they are weak or small or insignificant. The most spiritually aware,
    most powerful, wisest people I have ever met, learned about, and learned from
    have all been human. And yet they have been leaps and bounds above my experience
    and skill at every turn, being my teachers far more than my equals. I can only
    dream to reach a state even remotely close to them before this lifetime of mine
    ends.
