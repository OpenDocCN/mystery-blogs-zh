- en: To start, you will need to go outside, as far from civilization as possible--the
    farthest the better. Once you get to a fairly quiet area with little wing, sit
    down in the grass and relax. You will need to meditate for as long as it takes
    for your mind to be completely clear. You'll know when you're ready when you feel
    as if you are floating away and you are one with the sounds around you.

- en: Once you are ready to begin, you will need your paper and charcoal. Turn and
    hold the paper horizontally in your hands. With the charcoal, draw a pentagram
    as detailed as you can in the center of the paper. Fold it over horizontally.
    Draw a pair of reptilian eyes as detailed as you can that are boring into your
    own. Remember to stay calm and meditative.

- en: Now this is where you will need your pin or needle if you brought it. You will
    need to draw the smallest amount of blood, no larger than a drop or two. You may
    prick yourself anywhere, preferably on your fingertip or hand. If you didn't bring
    a needle or pin, check your fingers. If you have a hangnail, grab it between your
    fingers and pull on it. It'll sting a little, but not terribly. That should draw
    a perfect amount of blood. If no blood comes out, try squeezing your finger. Let
    a drop of blood land in between the eyes or wipe some blood between them.
  id: totrans-20

- en: Wait for the blood to dry. Once it is maroon or brown, draw a diamond around
    the blood stain. Take the raw meat and place it beside your paper. With your knife,
    cut off a small piece and eat it. Then, throw the knife aside and push the meat
    farther from you and closer to the paper. Do the same with the dead animal. This
    shall be your sacrifice.

- en: Meditate some more whilst chewing, concentrating on the feeling of flight--a
    feeling of freedom and majesty, the wind stinging your cheeks, hunting--the thrill
    and might in killing and eating fresh meat, breathing flame--the slight burn and
    heat but pride in harnessing an untamable essence, the strength and power of the
    roar of the creature you will soon be. Take your time chewing until it is practically
    pasty. Once you have swallowed the meat, you can cease meditating.

    able to turn back human. However, if you somehow find other dragons, learn their
    ways, and truly become one of them, you may forget all about your past life as
    a human. You will feel as if you were dragon forever.

    of the spell: "Dragon of power, dragon of might, dragon of fear and dragon of
    fright, I have linked my blood to you, now let my dragon dreams come true. I have
    eaten, thought, and dreamed like you, now let my dragon dream come true. I know
    this one thing for a fact: that once I''m done I can''t come back. But I believe
    and I can see, so lay your magic claws on me. Only you decree, the greatest beast,
    upon my sacrifice you shall feast. I have given up so much, so I only beg for
    your soft touch. Dragon of power, dragon of might, bring my fantasies into light!"'

- en: 'You will need to feel like a lower species and practically bow down to the
    dragons. You must respect them, as you are asking for a lot from them. After the
    spell is cast, the transformation will begin over a range of a week to a month.
    As I have said before, it is different for everyone. In order to keep the spell
    going, you must chant: "Dragon of power, dragon of might, bring my fantasies into
    light!" Every night before sleep.'

- en: This is where complications may happen. Once you begin to see either stubs growing
    above your shoulder blades, large bumps growing under hair, unusual nail growth,
    oddly sharp teeth, scaly or rough skin, or all of the above, this is when you
    will need to leave the house. Pack enough food to last a month. That is all you
    will need. Unfortunately, you cannot say goodbye to anyone in your family as this
    may cause complications that will be reviewed in step 11\. Stay hidden and far
    from civilization.

- en: Soon, you will be fully transformed into a dragon and be able to hunt your own
    food. Gradually, you will get used to your new body. As said before, you will
    lose memory of your human life as you go on permanently as a dragon. Every person's
    dragon form is different. Try and find other dragons, but stay far from humans.
    Scientists may trap you, etc. Humans will no longer be your friends.

- en: You can not change your physical form and dragons are not a physical creature
    they are spiritual creature and don't appreciate the way people talk about them
    through spells (the way you are currently) and you can work with dragons mentally
    but not physically which also means you can not shift your body also don't eat
    raw meant it very ill and so can dead animals.

  zh: 您不能改变自己的物理形态，龙不是物理存在，它们是灵体，不欣赏通过咒语（就像您现在这样）来谈论它们的方式，您可以在心灵上与龙沟通，但不能在物理上改变自己的身体，这也意味着您不能转变您的身体，同时也不要吃生肉，这非常危险，死去的动物也一样。
