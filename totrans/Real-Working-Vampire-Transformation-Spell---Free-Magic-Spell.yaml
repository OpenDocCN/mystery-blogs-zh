- en: I do believe in Magic. I am a second generation Wiccan, I have studied Magic
    my entire life, and I have cast many spells. I joined this site because several
    of my Pagan friends also use this site. From your profile, I can conclude you
    are a someone who really likes Harry Potter and has absolutely no clue how Real
    Magic works and instead lives in her fantasy world of Hogwarts. If you wish to
    remain in the safety of childhood, fine, but understand there is a difference
    between fantasy and reality. Real Magic is a natural energy that effects energy,
    and does not defy nature.

    I don't know real magic! I've studied different types of magic my entire life!

    works with earth and nature. And depending on your craft you might work with creatures
    of the sort.

    is Harry Potter, this is reality. You can keep shouting transfiguration until
    you are blue in the face, but it will not make it real. Real Magik has been explained
    to you so many times, Hogward93, I see no point in repeating myself. This will
    be the last time I say this to you, Harry Potter is not real. Real Magik does
    not defy nature. Do you need resources on real witchcraft because I will give
    you some if you do.'

    As far as I'm aware, transfiguration isn't real, you're thinking of glamour [which
    doesn't create physical changes, but it creates the illusion of change. Think
    of it like make-up, nothing's changed, but you're using something to hide something
    you want people to overlook] Also, I've started noticing your comments, be careful
    because you're tip-toeing the roleplaying line [roleplaying is against site rules]
    Please, read a few articles on magick before commenting again [just to help you
    not getting gagged for roleplaying]
