    how great of a tool they can be to enhance your magic.

    where every row, column, and diagonal each add up to the same number.'

    do this. If you think of all those giant puzzle books, there are thousands of

    up the magick square you use. You can make truly one-of-a-kind patterns for personal

    one of the classical planets. This is because the traditional sigils in ancient
    times were made this way. They are called the ***planetary sigils***.

    put a piece of paper over the square to get a clean sigil.

    Then I freehand draw it where I need it so that I can focus energy on the symbol
    for the magic or spell I’m doing.

    centered on family. Family is usually represented by the number 6\. Let’s say
    I want to focus on the topic even more by understanding my purpose in my family.

    use a number this big, you can look up an automatic magic square generator online):'

    correspond to 16, 21, 18, 16, 15, 19, 5.

    start and end, but this isn’t necessary. We’ll skip that step.

    look:'

    tarot reading, I inscribe it on paper to be placed under the tablecloth where
    I do my reading.

    fancy-looking, especially if you figure out a lot of symmetries to copy across.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    This gives the sigil an open and flowing look to it rather than the “loops” you
    see in mine.
  prefs: []

    into pieces of wood as a personalized rune set. You could also turn a protection
    sigil into a necklace or pendant.

    favorite ones onto small stones. The possibilities are endless.
