    enchant tools to use in your craft, but the spell is a bunch of made up nonsense.

    I will leave you alone on that But I do wanna say this: please be a little more
    respectfull, instead of saying that what I have made ''''is a bunch of made up
    nonsense'''' you could also say what I did wrong...or give people hints on how
    to do it better....because I am kinda getting offended by your reactions!'

    You cannot make stuff up and expect people to simply agree with you. This does
    not work because you do not understand how Real Magic works. If you did, you would
    not have written this. I mentioned how you can bless tools to be used in rituals,
    that is real. What you described, claiming you turn a physical blade into a ''demon
    slaying sword'' I can tell you are making it up. Demons are not as common as popular
    culture would make you believe, they do not behave how it is seen in movies, and
    if you need assistance dispelling a demon, it is far easier than a sword fight.
    Do more research before submitting more make believe spells onto the site, we
    have enough fake spells already.

    and never by invoking Lucifer as he leads the demons

- en: There is a fundamental flaw in the idea of 'slaying' demons that tends to go
    overlooked. As incorporial, ethereal beings of energy they are spirits/souls.
    Be they astral, abysmal, infernal, heavenly, or otherwise (humans included) Soul
    is immutable. Best you could hope for would be to repel or banish an entity, or
    temporarily weaken it ('injure', in a manner of speaking) by disrupting or diffusing
    its energy.

- en: No, Tadashi's correct as usual. He explained why the spell is flawed [you cannot
    transform a physical object into an astral object like a ''demon blade'' to slay
    demons with] be he DID mention you can enchant a physical object to make it a
    spiritual tool. [an Athame for example, it's a physical blade, but Witches enchant
    it and use it to direct and cut spiritual energy] As outlined, this spell is clearly
    written by someone who wants to sound cool and doesn't actually practice witchcraft.
    Can you edit it to work? Yes [again, Tadashi mentioned it is plausible]

- en: As for invoking Lucifer, Lucifer's not evil. Demons aren't evil either. Lucifer
    helps people who struggle with confidence and advocating for themselves [free
    will stuff] demons are similar. Just as people work with angels for guidance in
    situations [there's an angel for protecting children, an angel of love, and angel
    for safe travel, and angel for wisdom, so on] there are demons who help with similar
    things. The issue is, people don't know how to work with these energies, and humans
    don't understand how demons work [see also faeries, Dragons, angels and basically
    any other spiritual being] so what we might perceive as ''evil'' a demon would
    see as direct or even a necessary sacrifice toward a goal. If you don't know how
    to work with any spiritual being [angel, demon, faerie, Dragon] and you upset
    them, things can get ugly for you because they're teaching you why you should
    respect your commitments. This is also why many Satanists [especially those in
    The Satanic Temple, which is probably the most common one you'll meet] can come
    across as mean. One of the sins in their faith is ignorance, and according to
    their faith, they have the religious right to belittle you for your ignorance.
    Demons are similar. They're nice, but if you show them your true colours, they
    will give it right back. Most people who have had bad experiences with ''demons''
    or ''evil spirits'' is the result of the person asking the spirit for something
    in exchange for something else. The person gets what they wanted, then goes ''You
    know what, you're not real, so I'm not going to buy that expensive wine I promised
    you.'' and the next thing they know, they're haunted.
