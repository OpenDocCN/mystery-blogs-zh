# Herbal Mixture for Mental Magic Enhancement

This herbal concoction will enhance all magical workings involving the mind. It can be ingested (tea) or burned and inhaled (incense inhalation)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Herbal Mixture for Mental Magic Enhancement'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   9 Bay Leaves

*   Thyme

*   Parsley

*   Dill or Ground Dill Weed

*   Cinnamon

*   Dried Dandelion Roots (2-)

*   Burned 1 inch tip of any incense stick

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   9 Bay Leaves

*   Thyme

*   Parsley

*   Dill or Ground Dill Weed

*   Cinnamon

*   Dried Dandelion Roots (2-)

*   Burned 1 inch tip of any incense stick

 Measurements do not matter for this "potion". Take 9 bay leaves, Thyme, Parsley, Dill and grind/ blend these together until it is a powdery mix. You can add this mixture to tea and drink it. Or you could burn this concoction and meditate while inhaling the fumes.

If you add the aforementioned optional ingredients, I do not suggest ingesting the mixture. I suggest burning it and meditating inside of the fumes.

Do this before any magical working involving your mind or the mind of your victim. You can do it in small doses as a pre-cursor to every spell. Or in larger doses as an overall psychic enhancement.

No matter how large the dose, only use 9, 17, 81, or 153 bay leaves.

153 bay leaves?! Without practice it will not matter if you used that many or not. This might help some enter a mindset for work, though I would take the incense option of the tea because I doubt it tastes very good. As for the incense, I am unsure if the cinnamon would overpower the dill, but I could live with that. However, if you are hoping to take a sip and instantly power up, you will not.
