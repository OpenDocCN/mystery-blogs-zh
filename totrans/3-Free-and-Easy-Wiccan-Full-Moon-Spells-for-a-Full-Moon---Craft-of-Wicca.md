The full moon is a powerful time for spellwork and manifestation, which is why there are so many Wiccan full moon spells.

 During this phase of the moon, the energy is heightened and the veil between the physical and spiritual world is at its thinnest, allowing for spells to be more effective. This is why [esbats](https://craftofwicca.com/what-are-wiccan-esbats-the-esbat-rituals-and-rites-explained/) occur at this time.

Additionally, the full moon is associated with emotional release and letting go of what no longer serves us, making it an ideal time for manifestation and change.
