- en: First you need to make a doll. The cloth doll acts as the querent or the individual
    asked about. Draw a human shape on your light cloth and cut this out. Then trace
    this shape on your darker cloth and cut it out. Fill the space between the two
    cloth shapes with a few stems of flowers, fully intact, leaves and everything.
    Let some of this go over the sides of the doll. It doesn't need to be perfect.
    Next thread your needle and begin to sew your doll making sure not to sew it too
    tight. When finished knot off the thread and cut the excess.

    for the dominoes but you can make lots to represent these.

    representations use symbols you are comfortable with.

    your lots around your doll simultaneously, and begin to interpret.

    mean, and how to interpret their placement after cast.
