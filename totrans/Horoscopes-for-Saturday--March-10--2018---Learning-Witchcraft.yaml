    to get tough with people who let you down. Some people respond best to praise
    and some people respond best to criticism. Learn how to tell the difference.

    lot to you personally – but you must not go it alone. The more people you can
    bring into your planning orbit the more likely you are to succeed. It’s that simple.

    48 hours, but that’s okay. Some people can be amazingly sensitive but that must
    not stop you from telling them what they need to know. It’s for their own good.

    you now, so get out into the world and make your mark – and make it a big one.

    the way this weekend. If for whatever reason you fail to get on top of your workload

    Of course there is. A risk-taker weighs up the odds before making a move, while
    a hothead acts without thinking. Put your brain cells to work this weekend – then
    act.

    don’t have to play their silly game. Let them know you are not in the least bit
    intimidated. You don’t need to get aggressive about it – laughing at them will
    hurt a lot more.

    now. A friend knows a great deal about a situation that is causing you problems,
    so why not let their knowledge benefit you? Don’t be too stubborn for your own
    good.

    they can do for you. The planets indicate there is every possibility they will
    be happy to help you, so what are you waiting for? It never hurts to ask.

    get through. There are ways you can find time for your own needs, not least by
    getting other people to shoulder some of the burden. You don’t have to do it all
    on your own.

    reason why you should doubt what they say, so put your suspicious nature on hold
    for a bit and let them guide you with good advice. Or do you really know it all?

    are right where you are supposed to be. Once you acknowledge that fact you will
    find it much easier to enjoy life. You’ll enjoy considerably more success as well.

    Your mind is more powerful than you give it credit for and if you believe something
    strongly enough you can make it come true. Put that theory to the test this weekend.
