 Put the spirit in a pan on the cooker. Heat it very gently and stir in the salt and sugar so it has completely dissolved.

Add the Cherry Blossom (washed) and stir very well, gently with a wooden spoon. Keep the heat low; this is just to warm the potion, not boil it. Now add the lemon juice and evoke the following spell:

"Love light, love bright, love falls like snow tonight. Bright petals in the air. Bright petals everywhere. I want to dance with love. I take a chance with love. Love come to me. Love, set me free. Love teaches me to be the lover that I can be. By sun and moon and three times timee: this is my will so mote it be".

Turn off the heat and once cooled down, pour the potion base into a nice bottle.The next day, take three drops in a clear glass of fresh water, three times a day, for three days.
