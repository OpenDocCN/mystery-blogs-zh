- en: The quintessential image of the witch is incomplete without a large cast iron
    cauldron filled with a bubbling potion. While the image is folklore, potions *are*
    a really effective form of witchcraft. There’s always truth in the legends! This
    divination potion is one of many, many potion recipes that are proven to work.

    potions. They can be brewed to drink, to bathe in, to anoint yourself with, and
    even for the simple act of brewing the potion itself.

    my divination abilities. Not only is it absolutely delicious, but it’s very effective!

    you aren’t clairvoyant at all. This potion will instead enhance abilities that

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To brew any potion, you *always* need a cauldron or pot. The best tool to have
    is a 100% cast iron cauldron, but these are expensive. It’s otherwise good to
    use a cast iron pan or any pan that isn’t completely metal, as this tends to dilute
    the power of the potion (in my experience).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[This is a great cast iron pan to use](https://rstyle.me/+sFVmFdtsIMGxTHUYyXHejw),
    but it (and most others) is super expensive. If you can’t afford a cast iron cauldron
    or pot, don’t worry: you can still make this potion.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can 100% use a metal pot, but you may need to gather some extra energy and
    let it brew for a bit longer since the metal will zap some of the energy.

- en: You will also need some sort of heat source to concoct this potion. You can
    use a stove (gas or electric), a fire, or even a bunch of candles under your pot
    if that’s all you have.
  prefs: []

    effects as an open flame.

    one by one, focusing on your intention of increased divination.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, it’s time to gather your energy, however you do this. Spend another 5-10
    minutes sending energy into the pot, picturing your desired outcome (increased
    divination, especially in the manner you’d like it). Continue to do this until
    you feel done.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stir the potion in a clockwise motion 13 times. After this is done, you can
    stir the potion with the spoon as needed, but do so gently without making a full
    circle. You want these 13 circles to be the only circles you complete with your
    spoon.

    Serve as soon as it has cooled slightly; this potion is best served hot.

    to chant, then by all means do so. You can look up a simple chant for a divination
    spell or write your own.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    make your intention more clear. If you struggle in either of these areas then
    I do recommend coming up with a chant.
