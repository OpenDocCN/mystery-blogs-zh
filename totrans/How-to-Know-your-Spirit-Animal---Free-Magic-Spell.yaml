    light them. The candles will help you concentrate. (If you have any candles, it
    doesn''t matter what color it is.) Then, get into a meditative state and close
    your eyes. Imagine you''re in nature. You could be in a meadow, a forest, or even
    a jungle, whatever suits you. Just keep walking in your dream and chant the words:'

    to it and ask if they are your spirit animal. If they say no, continue walking
    to find your spirit animal. If they say yes, then you know that they're your spirit
    animal. You can ask them questions. But you do have to leave. If you wan to meet
    your spirit animal again, then you can meditate again.
