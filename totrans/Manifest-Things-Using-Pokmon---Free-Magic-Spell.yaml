    The basis of the spell is to name a Pokémon in your game after something you want
    to manifest and level it up to bring it into your life.

- en: This is a simple pop culture spell I have done for years and it has worked for
    me every time I've used it. It works just like any other spell, **it cannot manifest
    characters, I've been asked that before. You can't do that with magic, kids. Sorry
    but it's the truth. Misconceptions about pop culture witchcraft come from misinformed
    children trying to do things against the laws of nature so I'm informing y'all
    now. **This spell is helpful to those who want to manifest things but feel as
    if they don't have the time or attention span to do so, it helps focus their energy
    into manifestation. Remember that magic is all about intentions so keep that in
    mind when you use this to manifest.

- en: The first step of the spell is to get a Pokemon in the game. After you caught
    it, name it something you want to manifest. You can name it anything you want,
    you can name them Grounding to help ground yourself, you can name them Abundance
    to bring more money into your life, you can name them Self Love, ect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you've named your Pokemon, go through the game and level it up like you
    would normally do in a play through. Try to use the Pokemon often so what you
    want to manifest is always on your mind because you're thinking of your Pokemon.
    If you have a game that includes interacting with your Pokemon or super training,
    use that with your Pokemon. The goal is to constantly be thinking of this Pokemon
    and having your full attention on it like you normally would when manifesting.
    If you have a Pokeball Plus or play Pokemon Go, take your Pokemon with you everywhere
    you go. Interact with it as much as possible.

- en: After a while of doing this, you will see your manifestations. But if you want
    to go a step further, there are more steps you can take to manifest using a Pokemon.
    You can catch a Pokemon that corresponds with what you're manifesting. Look into
    Pokedex entries to see what each Pokemon does. For example, Meowth would attract
    abundance, Celebi would help you enjoy the time you have now if you feel time
    moves quickly for you, Absol would help you be more aware of danger so you stay
    safe, ect. Not only would the Pokemon itself have things to help manifest your
    desire, but its typing also helps. This is a list of general type correspondences.

- en: Put a lot of thought towards what Pokemon you want to use to manifest your desires
    with. Another step you can take is purchasing a stuffed animal of the Pokemon
    and draw sigils on it to help manifest. I recommend getting a stuffed keychain,
    they sell those on Pokemon.com . I find that they work the most because they're
    always with you.
