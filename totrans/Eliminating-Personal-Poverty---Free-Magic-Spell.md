# Eliminating Personal Poverty

  Rated 5/5 Stars

A modern-day adaptation of an ancient formula, this spell ensures that you always have the necessities of life, such as somewhere to stay and enough to eat. Because it becomes part of your everyday environment, you simply need to refresh the ingredients when you feel the time right.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Eliminating Personal Poverty'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Small glass container

*   Salt

*   Sugar

*   Rice

*   Safety pin

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Small glass container

*   Salt

*   Sugar

*   Rice

*   Safety pin

 Fill the container with a mixture of the salt, sugar and rice. Place the open safety pin in the centre of the mixture. Put the container in the open air where you can easily see it.

Occasionally give the bowl a shake to reinvigorate the energies. Though this spell has no particular timeframe, the more confident you become in your own abilities the quicker it will work. Rather than using salt, sugar and rice you can use a pot-pourri of your choice.

Shaking the container also keeps the energies fresh and you must use your intuition as to when they need changing.

I did this spell when I was 18 and it worked. A rich old man asked me out and spoiled me with money, gifts etc.He died of old age but I still get money in ways i can't even explain. It's a simple spell yes, but it works. A lot

This appears to be an incomplete money bowl spell. As outlined, it does not work, but money bowls are a real spell which attracts wealth to you. One key component in these are coins to indicate what you are trying to attract. As outlined, this only attracts bugs.
