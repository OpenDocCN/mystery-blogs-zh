    a deep dive series on the [tarot](https://craftofwicca.com/tarot/).

    should be noted that there have been several variants on this card.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    meaning of these is the same if you think of The Magician as a stage magician/entertainer.

    magic.

    infinity, robes, ouroboros, a magician’s baton, a garden/flowers, and a table.'

    lot.

    on the table. He also has his right arm outstretched and is wearing a headband.

    the cards. It gets you in the habit of looking for specific details.

    like he’s commanding something. Many remember this as he is connecting heaven
    and earth. His power is infinite.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common reversed Magician meaning is deceit, confusion, and lack.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Confusion and lack shouldn’t be hard to remember. Reversed cards often mean
    the opposite of the upright meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Magician has access to everything displayed on the table, therefore the
    reversed card means a lack of resources. The Magician understands the tricks he
    is doing, but the reversed card indicates he is confused.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He might even think the trick is real or fail to perform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Deceit* is interesting because in a sense the upright card is deceiving the
    crowd. But you think of it this way: crowds are in on the fact that a stage magician
    is performing a trick.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reversed Magician doesn’t let the crowd in on it. He truly deceives them
    and gains from it. This is the opposite of the Magician’s nature.

- en: I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their
    symbolism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, and so it’s
    good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to
    have a good interpretation for the moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember,
    each reading, deck, person, position, and the question is different. Reading the
    cards is an art, not a science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll use a different deck for every one of these. Today’s is the Thoth Tarot.
    I love how this deck abstracts the images without straying too far from traditional
    symbolism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s start by noticing some differences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The snake above the head is much more prominent than on his belt. The [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros)
    is a snake eating its own tail, but in this version, the snake is in a [caduceus
    symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus): birth of new things.'

    the [fool’s journey](https://craftofwicca.com/fool-tarot-card-meaning-easy/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This really draws out the symbol and interpretation of infinity and endless
    cycling. Depending on the reading, this can be an important meaning to draw out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Magician is much happier in this one. Instead of the stern face, this one
    is enjoying the performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He is also balancing on edge with deep concentration. There is a sense of being
    lost in the moment. It can be meditative or refer to getting lost in your work.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Context matters a lot when reading the cards. Here are some particularly strong
    things to look out for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Magician often comes paired with other cards. If the other card sets a topic
    like your job or finances or hobby or relationships, then the Magician will indicate
    skill in that topic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past/present/future positions it means previous/current/future skill
    in that topic. When occurring in a specific timeframe, it often means that your
    dominance and resourcefulness at that time are not present at other times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if the topic is relationships and the Magician appears in the past,
    it means you had an easy working relationship in the past that is no longer working.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the Magician appears in an internal or emotional position, it will likely
    mean that you are performing for those around you. You’ve successfully shown people
    what they want to see, but your true emotions are different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is time to either come clean about them or to stop performing. The trick
    is over. This is why I like the Thoth interpretation of balancing on an edge.
    You can only walk that fine line so long before a slip-up causes you to fall.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: See how the position can dictate the reading? This will become even more important
    when you take into account what the rest of the cards have indicated to that point.

    so keep at it and the meanings will come easier with time and experience.
