    wrong with their South Node qualities and what they need to change, and they give
    the nodal person the inspiration to actually make these changes.
  prefs: []

    to the North Node person. However, over time, they may balk when they realize
    that being around the Mars person is a lot of *work*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the North Node person has to confront the qualities that they currently *lack*
    over and over. If the North Node person is able to handle this, then the relationship
    can be really progressive and healing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of action! It will take a super evolved North Node person to really make this
    relationship work, as they will be triggered constantly by the Mars individual.

    choose to make this happen.
  prefs: []

    person at first. During the relationship, they can really enhance the soul growth
    of the Nodal person if they choose to take the intiative and ask those hard questions.
  prefs: []

    person *has* to push the North Node person towards growth. They can choose to
    ignore the difficult soul and emotional work. If they choose to embrace this aspect,
    then the relationship can deepen over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    during that past life. The Mars person probably took more than their share, or

    or anger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meanwhile, the South Node person can be incredibly attracted to the Mars person
    and can learn to forgive past hurts. However, if the South Node person isn’t *ready*
    to do this emotional work, then they may be passive aggressive or even aggressive
    towards Mars. In some cases, the abuse can flip in this lifetime, with the Nodal
    person acting as the perpetrator and the Mars individual playing the victim.

    have the Mars square South Node aspect, though this isn’t always the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in a past life, but they skipped the issues that they were supposed to address.
    In this life, they will be forced to address the problems between them in a more
    harsh and constant way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the Mars square North Node synastry couple first meets, they may feel intrigued
    by each other. They want to know more about each other, but there is also a rough
    energy between them and a sense of friction. This is usually what creates the
    attraction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    exists now. The relationship can be filled with power struggles, aggression, and
    anger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Mars square North Node means that the couple is always competing
    against each other instead of being on the same side. They may try to one-up each
    other, win fights, or control each other. This dynamic simply feels natural because
    of the energy between them from their past life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from evolving if they can’t work through their issues. They may feel like they
    are triggered by the other person over and over, and that it’s impossible to truly
    make peace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    because it reminds them of how that energy was directed *against* them in this
    past life. In fact, the Mars person will trigger emotion issues as well as issues
    relating to the Nodal person’s sense of self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Something about this relationship makes them feel that they can never evolve around
    the Mars person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, the Mars person may want to impress the Nodal person or somehow work
    things out, but their efforts are in vain. Typically, the Mars person fails to
    see what the Nodal person really needs to evolve, so they give them all of the
    wrong things. For example, Mars may buy the Nodal person gifts instead of attempting
    to connect emotionally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mars conjunct North Node synastry relationship *can* work if both people
    are willing to put the effort in. The Mars person must learn how to focus on themselves
    and build their own self-confidence without resorting to aggressive, competition,
    or games. They must stop trying to win the love of the Nodal person and start
    to realize that the Nodal person must *choose* to love them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meanwhile, the Nodal person must let go of their need to win against the Mars
    person. They are usually the ones who “lost” to Mars in a past lifetime, so now
    they may be obsessed with winning to try and even the scales. Over time, they
    will realize that this game of competition doesn’t truly change the energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Nodal person must learn how to win for themselves, not *against* someone
    else. They must forgive their partner for past hurts and learn how to be on the
    same side as a couple.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, the Mars square North Node synastry aspect means that there is an
    issue of competition in the relationship. The couple must learn to compete against
    themselves to be a better version of their soul, and to be united as a couple.
