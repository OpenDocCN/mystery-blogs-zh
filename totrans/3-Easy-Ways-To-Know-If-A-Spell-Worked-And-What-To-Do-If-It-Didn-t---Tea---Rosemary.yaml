    is: “how do I know if my spell worked?”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More experienced witches will say, “you’ll just know.” And while that’s definitely
    true, it isn’t always helpful to beginners.

- en: I’m one of those students who needs concrete guidelines. I learn from structure,
    so it was really important for me to figure out exactly how I would know if a
    spell was successful or not.

- en: 1\. You’ll Feel Powerful As The Spell Ends
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The actual ingredients of any spell are always important, but the most important
    piece of spellwork is your own concentration. You need to have not only mental
    focus, but *emotional focus*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re focusing so intently on a spell (I typically do it with my eyes
    closed and my hands outstretched while I chant), you will start to feel the energy
    buzzing. This feeling will grow the longer you do it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The energy will build as the spell progresses. If you feel this energy grow
    extremely powerful as the spell ends, there’s a good chance your spell worked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 99% of the time, this can be accomplished with a lot of focus, plus the desire
    for the outcome you’re trying to achieve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that while this means that your energy went *somewhere,* if you
    didn’t visualize the spell correctly or used ingredients that don’t match your
    intention, you may have accidentally done a different spell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is why it’s super important to focus very clearly on what you want and
    use ingredients that align with your desires. However, I find that when you feel
    this intense energy, it always has to go *somewhere*, so you definitely did something
    magical!

- en: 2\. You’ll Feel Tired Or Complete Afterwards
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After this culmination of energy, you might feel a little wiped. If it’s a super
    large spell, I take a nap, but most of the time I just need to chill out on the
    couch for a bit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s a clear indication that your spell worked!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, I’m not tired at all, but I do feel as though the spell was completed.
    I know this because I’m not interested in thinking about the topic anymore and
    feel very clearly that it’s time to move onto another activity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is another good indication that your spell is working while you go about
    your day!

- en: 3.You’ll See The Effects Of Your Spell Within 1-2 Months
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most spells take 2 months to work, max. Unless you did a spell for something
    huge *or* something long-term (such as a new job, a fertility spell, etc.), then
    odds are you’ll reap the rewards within 1-2 months.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your spell was clearly short term (or had no timeline specified) and you
    don’t notice any change at all within 1-2 months, then your spell either didn’t
    work or the energy was misdirected in a way you didn’t foresee.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what if the spell didn’t work?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, look to see if anything *has* happened that you may have caused inadvertently.
    The Universe always takes the path of least resistance, so your spell may have
    *technically* worked in a way you didn’t foresee. This happens quite a lot with
    love spells and money spells, but it can occur with any type of magic
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your spell had an unintended effect, you can either reverse the spell (if
    you don’t like what it has done) or cast another that works alongside the current
    spell (if you don’t mind the effects of it).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'However, if there are no unintended effects and nothing has happened at all,
    then there are two possibilities:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**You didn’t gather enough energy, so the spell didn’t have enough power to
    work.** You will need to do the spell again using different (or more) ingredients,
    cast a more powerful circle calling on the elements, and spend more time concentrating
    on focusing your energy during the spell.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The Universe will not allow your spell to work. Sometimes (though very rarely),
    a spell is blocked because of karma.** In this case, the energy probably dispersed.
    If you feel in your gut that this is true, then there’s nothing else that can
    be done at this time. If you’re unsure, using divination tools (such as tarot
    cards or a pendulum) can help you figure out what happened. Keep in mind that
    this is super rare and only happens about 1% of the time, for me at least.'
