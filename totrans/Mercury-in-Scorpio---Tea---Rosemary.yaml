- en: Mercury is the planet that rules the mind, thought processes, and communication
    style in Astrology.  It tells us not what we think about, but how we think. Mercury
    is the closest planet to the sun, and moves the fastest. It may be difficult to
    differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is the persona, and Mercury
    is the mind.

- en: People with Mercury in Scorpio developed emotionally at a young age, and tend
    to have high levels of emotional intelligence and understanding for other people.
    Their minds rationalize conflict by putting themselves in the shoes of the other

    Most people think of themselves as their persona, while their shadow self lives

    a Mercury in Aquarius is. Rather, they are looking for *universal* truths– things
