- en: Mercury is the planet that rules the mind, thought processes, and communication
    style in Astrology.  It tells us not what we think about, but how we think. Mercury
    is the closest planet to the sun, and moves the fastest. It may be difficult to
    differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is the persona, and Mercury
    is the mind.

- en: Mercury in Scorpio people are some of the most in tune and psychic thinkers
    in astrology. Scorpio is a water sign, and is ruled by emotions and psychism,
    which makes the Mercury in Scorpio mind much more emotional and dynamic than other
    Mercury signs.

- en: People with Mercury in Scorpio developed emotionally at a young age, and tend
    to have high levels of emotional intelligence and understanding for other people.
    Their minds rationalize conflict by putting themselves in the shoes of the other
    person, and not only asking what they would *do,* but how they would *feel* being
    in that position.

- en: With Scorpio being the sign of transformation, Mercury in Scorpio people are
    constantly transforming the way they think about and relate to others. These people
    are constantly learning something new, and applying it to their current situation
    to be a better version of themselves.

    find themselves becoming obsessed with their flaws and incapabilities instead
    of focusing on the light. Mercury in Scorpio people may choose, instead of changing
    their mindset, to change their outer world. This could lead them down dark and
    dangerous paths, seeking out danger and thrill.

    can be very emotionally aware and understanding, and empathetic towards others.
    However, when it comes to themselves, they have no understanding for the areas
    they are lacking.

    what you are going to say before you say it, and know what is going to happen
    before it does. Their mind is always prying into their unconscious brain to gain
    universal memories that other Mercury signs are incapable of grasping.

    Most people think of themselves as their persona, while their shadow self lives
    in their unconscious mind. With Mercury in Scorpio, the conscious and unconscious
    minds are blended. People with this placement have fully integrated their shadow
    self, and are now capable of seeing the universal truths.

- en: Mercury in Scorpio is not looking for objective truths in the same way that
    a Mercury in Aquarius is. Rather, they are looking for *universal* truths– things
    that only someone’s unconscious mind knows. They get this information in a variety
    of ways, and usually when communicating with other people does it come through.

    responsible for. This made them very emotionally intelligent at a young age, but
    also very discerning of others. This discernment turned into a 6th sense, where
    they can tell when someone is lying, being dishonest, or simply not relaying the
    full truth.

    to how they communicate with people. One of my clients developed the ability to
    see auras at a young age, which helped him to effectively communicate with people
    as he could literally see their moods. Another Mercury in Scorpio person I know
    is a channel for others, and a third one has guides speaking to him in audible
    words all the time.

    someone is lying. They can tell when someone is being phony, or acting only to

    and hidden meanings, they may come off as prying to other people. They tell you
    things you already knew about yourself, but did not want to admit. These people
    ask the difficult questions, and make you give them honest and truthful answers.
