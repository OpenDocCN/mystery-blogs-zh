- en: Everyone loves **love spells**, but actually performing one is where most people
    get stuck. Any spell needs a decent amount of ingredients that we don’t all have
    on hand in regular households.
  prefs: []

- en: Herbs are especially tricky to come by. Unless you live on a farm with a thriving
    herb garden, you probably don’t have every herb you need for a spell. Luckily,
    you can substitute herbs for any spell or even create your own as long as you
    know the properties of herbs.

- en: I find it surprisingly hard to figure out what herbs can be used for what, so
    I intend to start writing posts about herbal uses to help anyone who feels stuck.
    For this post, I chose 8 herbs that I personally love to use in *love magic* (and
    find to be effective) but I also chose herbs that are readily available, either
    online in dried form or at the grocery store. It shouldn’t be super difficult
    to source these herbs for a spell!

- en: 8\. Basil
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basil is known to be powerful when used in spells about love and fidelity, as
    well as finding a spouse or partner. I use it in relationship spells (to find
    a new relationship, encourage faithfulness, build an emotional connection, for
    self-love, etc.) but don’t find it to be as effective in spells concerning romance
    or sexuality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a sturdy herb that builds hearty, earthly connections between partners.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cinnamon is a great herb (that can be easily found in the spice section at the
    grocery store) if you need to “heat up” a cold and dying romance. It can be romantic
    and sweet or slightly sexual due to its zesty nature. Cinnamon is one of the most
    universal herbs for love magic that can be used almost any way you want.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even thought mint is well-known for being a prime ingredient in money spells,
    I find that it works super well in love spells too. It can be utilized for anything
    from building a relationship rituals to passion spells, but I do find that it
    gives a bit of zest to the spell. If you’re performing a spell to calm fights
    then you may not want mint, but any spell that requires zing will benefit from
    the addition of mint.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rosemary is one of the most often-used herbs in witchcraft because it can be
    purposed for *so many* different types of spells. It has been used for centuries
    and was included in wedding bouquets to bring long-lasting love to a marriage.
    Rosemary is great for any long-term partnership spell and for binding two people
    together.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though lavender is typically thought of as a relaxation herb, it’s actually
    used quite often for love and sex spells. It can strengthen love between two people,
    ignite lust and attraction, or deepen an emotional bond.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lavender is a great multi-purpose herb for any type of love spell you need to
    perform.

- en: 3\. Rose
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rose might not technically classify as an herb, but in the witchcraft world
    it’s usually lumped right in with other herbal tinctures and dried flowers. There’s
    so many ways to use rose! I have dried rose petals (which you can crush up) as
    well as rose essential oil, which is my favorite way to use the rose flower in
    a love spell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rose is the classic Valentine’s Day flower for a reason. Roses not only create
    super powerful love spells (of literally any type), but also ensure future happiness
    between a couple as well as stability and faithfulness.

- en: 2\. Chamomile
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chamomile is another herb that can be used in many, many different ways. For
    the purposes of love spells, Chamomile is great to attract a lover. It can also
    deepen the bond between two partners in an emotional or spiritual sense. I love
    that Chamomile is so versatile; you’re able to drink it, bathe in it, or use it
    in jar and satchel spells.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I see Jasmine as the herb that signifies emotional love, however I’ve found
    that it can also increase sensuality and passion. The key is that there needs
    to be some sort of emotional connection for jasmine to work; it’s not a purely
    physical herb. It can also be used to heal a broken heart.

    Keep in mind that you can always substitute ingredients in a spell, as long as

    for rose in a love spell) and working with intention!**'
