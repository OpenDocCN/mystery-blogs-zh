- en: Mars is the planet of action; it rules our drive, our motivation, our methods
    of accomplishing tasks, and our attraction to others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Virgo is the sign of doing things efficiently, so it helps Mars complete tasks
    that would otherwise fall to the wayside. Mars is a very erratic, aggressive planet,
    but I find that Virgo helps to temper this energy without removing the motivational
    aspect of Mars.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having Mars in Virgo in your chart is (in my opinion) really lovely! There are
    some great qualities that come from the energy of this placement and there is
    a clear path to overcome the difficult characteristics.

    having to do with motivation to work), and attraction to others (both mentally
    and physically).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Individuals with Mars in Virgo are usually really productive. They’re great
    at noticing small details and will fine-tune things until they get them right.
    They have a lot of drive and motivation to finish a task, but they might spend
    quite a bit of time until it’s just the way they want it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People with Mars in Virgo are really good at juggling multiple projects. While
    it might take them a bit to finish everything, they almost always do a job *well.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They need to have a project to work on at all times; idleness doesn’t mesh well
    with these folks and can cause anxiety or depression. These busy minds need constant
    tasks! People with Mars in Virgo actually *get* energy from being busy, as long
    as they’re doing something they’re interested in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These people are sharp thinkers and can solve any complex problem with enough
    time. It’s best not to rush them; they work at their own pace, but always have
    enough drive to finish a project that’s important to them.

- en: 'Temper:'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Folks with Mars in Virgo do have a temper, but they don’t always show it. They
    have strict standards of quality and can get angry or critical towards other people
    who may be more lax. This can cause issues in the workplace, in the home, or in
    any environment where they need to work with others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They’re not consistently angry people. They will either let the anger build
    up and release it all at once in an outburst or let it out slowly through small,
    critical remarks throughout the day. Sometimes, they do both. They’re very difficult
    people when annoyed, but it usually doesn’t last that long.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those with Mars in Virgo are perfectionistic (especially in the house where
    Mars falls), so their main source of anger usually comes from things not being
    up to their standards. They aren’t good at sparing others’ feelings when they
    do become irritable; you don’t want to be on the bad side of a Mars in Virgo individual!

    some control over the process. They’re pretty particular about how things are
    done and they expect nothing less from other people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but I personally know people with this placement who excel in detective work,
    those who are entrepreneurs, individuals high up in the corporate world, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These people don’t need a lot of praise from superiors because they just *know*
    when they completed a task efficiently. Unless there are conflicting signs and
    aspects in the chart, they usually have a clearly defined path to success in their
    mind’s eye. They’re very clever, enjoy solving intricate problems, and are good
    at getting things done.

    of love.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They’re often attracted to people who seem simple and normal; they’re able to
    see something special in these individuals that draws them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because attraction is gender-specific, I’ll talk more about it a few paragraphs
    down; you’ll find that the way Mars in Virgo manifests (concerning attraction)
    is different depending on if the person identifies as masculine or feminine.

    When Mars in Virgo is in control, they make their partner feel extremely important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These individuals aren’t *all* into casual sex, but many of them don’t see an
    issue with “practicing” and honing their sexual skills before they meet a long-term
    partner. Just as they strive to be great at work, they also want to be good in
    bed. They generally need a bit of practical experience to reassure them that they’re
    competent before they can let go themselves and enjoy the experience.
  prefs: []

    Sex is imperative to them; they usually pay very close attention to their partners
    and try to learn what they like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Virgo is often thought of as a “virginal” sign, but this definitely isn’t the
    case with Mars in Virgo people. They aren’t afraid of experimenting, but are instead
    fearful of being “bad in bed” or failing to please their partner. They aren’t
    selfish lovers by any means.

    room to improve on the negative qualities, while the positive qualities are blessings
    that come naturally to the individual.

    expect to see every single one of these qualities in yourself. Look at your own

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This part can get a little confusing, so bear with me as I explain it. Basically,
    Mars shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it does
    for someone with more feminine energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s up to you to choose with energy you identify with more. If you’re unsure,
    I recommend reading the description of each energy for Mars in Virgo (below) and
    choosing what resonates with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, in a man (or someone with masculine energy), Mars will show how the
    person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person is
    flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Mars in Virgo.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a woman (or someone with feminine energy), Mars will show what kind of qualities
    they are attracted to. How this person will act depends on their Venus sign, but
    Mars dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that these distinctions aren’t absolute. As a straight woman, I
    definitely show my Venus sign when I’m flirting, but sometimes my Mars will bleed
    through just a bit. I find these definitions to be about 80% accurate, but we’re
    always a unique combination of all of our signs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The typical Mars in Virgo male likes to take care of small, practical matters
    for his partner to show appreciation. He would be the guy to make you coffee in
    the morning, start your car in the winter, or bring home that special meal he
    knows you like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll know a Mars in Virgo man likes you if he starts doing things to make
    your life easier, no matter how small they are. Another easy clue is if he takes
    great pains to notice the small details about your life and about your personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, he will remember what his partner wears, what their favorite color
    is, and pick up on small idiosyncrasies that make his partner special to him.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mars in Virgo man subconsciously wants to be helpful to tie him to his partner,
    even if that’s not what he thinks he’s doing consciously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In bed, the Mars in Virgo man is also extremely helpful and is quick to notice
    the small things that his partner likes. He’s a *super* attentive lover and can
    be really selfless and giving. He is turned on by making his partner enjoy themselves,
    so partners of Mars in Virgo men are usually very satisfied.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Mars in Virgo female (or anyone who identifies with feminine energy) is attracted
    to men who pick up on details about her and care about the little things that
    happen in her life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She probably won’t go for the guy with the loudest energy in the room but will
    feel drawn to the man who notices what she’s wearing, remembers to get her the
    drink she likes, etc. Her Mars isn’t focused on looks (although her other signs
    may be – check the chart) but cares more about the *actions* of a potential partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intelligence and knowledge is also attractive to her, even if it’s not in the
    traditional educational sense. She is drawn towards partners who are good at what
    they do and who don’t cut corners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also important to the Mars in Virgo woman to find someone who satisfies
    her in bed and who prioritizes her sexual needs. She wants a guy who will make
    sure she has a good time during sex because it makes *him* happy as well as her.
