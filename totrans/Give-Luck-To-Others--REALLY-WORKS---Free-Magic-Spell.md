**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your finger

*   Voice

*   The person you want to grant luck

*   Lavender-Optional

Make sure the person is next to you. This usually grants that person luck. Like say, they have a crush and don't know how to talk to him/her, this spell may help. Just follow the steps:
1\. Touch the person's third eye- near the forehead
2\. Chant the following. Its important.
''I ask Diana to
Come and bring
this unlucky
(gender and
name) luck
as I trace
Her symbol
With my
Magick hand.

3\. Trace the symbol in the air of the Triple Goddess- tip, look on Google

4\. After, take some liquid lavender, its optional though, and make the symbol also on the person's forehead

5\. Say,
''Blessed be''

You may repeat this multiple times, though one time works fine.
