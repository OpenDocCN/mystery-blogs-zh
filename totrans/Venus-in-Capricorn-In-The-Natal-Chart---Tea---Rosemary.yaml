    a large impact on your entire life. Here are the main ways that Venus in Capricorn
    shows up.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Venus in Capricorn people can be materialistic or enjoy symbols of status
    sometimes, others care more about quality of items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The typical Venus in Capricorn is known for being extremely materialistic, but
    I don’t feel that this is always the case. I find that a Venus in Capricorn individual
    is either materialistic *or* practical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most folks with Venus in Capricorn are really practical with possessions and
    money. It’s always a safe bet to let these people handle your finances. They typically
    don’t spend beyond their means unless other elements of the chart support this.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Venus in Capricorn, you aren’t a party animal by any means. You may be
    less “fun-loving” than others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much of this is because you’re distrustful of others, so it’s hard for you to
    open up and let loose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another element of your serious personality is your practicality. Venus in Capricorn
    is all about being down-to-earth and efficient; in fact, you may even find more
    pleasure in hard work than in a typical party atmosphere.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have long term goals and are grounded and realistic. Most Venus in Capricorn
    folks steer clear of anything flashy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, with Venus in Capricorn, you do have an inner child “locked up.” When
    you’re super comfortable around someone, your inner child comes out and you can
    be quite silly and playful. This happens rarely and may be surprising to people
    when they first see it.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Values:'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    rules and then following them. You will especially value rules in the house that
    your Venus sits in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the house that Venus is in, you might also value hard work. For
    example, with Venus in the 10th house, you value hard work and status, but with
    Venus in the 7th house, you value putting the work into relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably place significance on things that sustain over time with Venus
    in Capricorn. You won’t go for the quick fix but instead value long term investments
    when it comes to money, people, your job, and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With materialistic items, you prefer older, quality pieces. You don’t like super
    trendy or new things but would rather have a historical item.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Venus in Capricorn usually means that you were born into a family with parents
    who adhered to a certain set of conduct rules. You were probably forced to behave
    a certain way, especially socially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you deviated as a child, you were made to feel guilty or bad. Vulnerabilities
    and affection were probably not priorities. Instead, you needed to follow the
    rules and maintain appearances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some families focused more on appearances while others were simply forced to
    follow a strict set of rules.
  prefs: []

    to develop your own set of values as you grow.
  prefs: []

    that you figure out what matters to *you.*

    You’re attracted to the sterner stuff that’s underneath the pomp and circumstance.

    of courtship. You’re like to go slow and wait before jumping into a relationship.
  prefs: []

    good reputation, wealth, or fame. Other folks with Venus in Capricorn are captivated
    by potential partners with a sense of practicality and a good work ethic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re first getting to know someone, you keep a lot of your thoughts and
    emotions private. You may come off as cold or removed, but you tend to attract
    folks who enjoy this distance or see it as flirtatious.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to someone who doesn’t measure up to your criteria. You move slow and are discerning.

    the pros and cons of a potential partner carefully.

    steadfast and true. You find safety in practicality and all that is known.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This part can get a little confusing, so bear with me as I explain it. Basically,
    Venus shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it
    does for someone with more feminine energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s up to you to choose with energy you identify with more. If you’re unsure,
    I recommend reading the description of each energy for Venus in Capricorn below
    and choosing what resonates with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, in a woman or someone with feminine energy, Venus will show how the
    person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When this person is flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Venus
    in Capricorn. These Capricorn qualities will show up directly in the personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a man or someone with masculine energy, Venus will show what kind of qualities
    they are *attracted to*. How this person will *act* depends on their Mars sign,
    but their Venus sign dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a
    partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we evolve and change and the gender lines blur, these distinctions become
    less absolute. For example, I find that *most* women will show a lot of the qualities
    of their Venus when they’re flirting, but a few of their Mars qualities will bleed
    through also.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to learn about both Venus and Mars. Each person has a unique
    combination of both qualities, although this combination may be swayed slightly
    depending on the person’s gender.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, a man who is ultra-comfortable with his sexuality will display many
    more of his Venus qualities, while a man who struggles with his sexuality probably
    won’t “own” these Venusian qualities, so he will instead look for them in a female
    partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a touch of Venus. With Venus in Capricorn, this men will be practical and focused
    in bed. He won’t get caught up in romantic fantasies but will instead focus on
    the actual technique.
  prefs: []

    aspects to Venus.
