Light the red candle. Red represents energy and what you're doing here is drawing on energy to cancel your debt. Say the following words:

Debt begone
lickety split,
dept begone
before I spit.

Then take the five pentacles or whatever objects symbolizing your debt and and pass it through the candle flames until it catches fire. Let it burn to ashes in the empty bowl. Pitch out the candle's flame, then toss out the candle. On the next new moon, bury the ashes far from your home.
