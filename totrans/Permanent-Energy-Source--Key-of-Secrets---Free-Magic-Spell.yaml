    to know to do this properly)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inside a circle, put some small compact object (that will be your anchor) that's
    associated with the source (for example small pedant of the moon if the source
    is the moon or obsidian necklace if source is center of the earth, or key for
    etheric field)

- en: Put a simple box atop of your object, and atop of the box, put an metal plate.
    Put an colored candle in the metal plate, but note that color of candle must represent
    source of your energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the upper third of your candle, attach 8 pins (just poke 'em in the waxy
    candle). Then light up the candle
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need to meditate inside the circle, lying down or sitting, visualizing
    that anchor connecting with the supposed source of energy. You need to meditate
    until wax burns down and all pins fall to the metal plate from the candle. Then,
    you need to note in which shape pins fell. Draw that shape on the paper, that
    will be the code word, or the "sigil" of your anchor. When you visualize the shape,
    or look at it on the paper, you are unlocking a pathway to the source with your
    anchor key, while doing so, meditate on drawing energy trough this channel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can leave anchor on the paper with code word, just be sure to draw circle
    around it and build up some basic protection around it, because you don't want
    certain entities coming to the leakage of the energy. By doing so, you have perpetual
    generator of supposed energy, a channel to the source.
