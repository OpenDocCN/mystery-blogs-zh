    the salt in, then continue. Add the garlic and pumpkin pie spice in at the same
    time (keep grinding)! Finally, the onion powder. As you grind envision all your
    energy pouring into the mortar and pestle.

    middle of the night for some reason leave it out over day. (Or, if you used holy
    water, moon water, or sun water, you don't need to leave it out.) You might need
    to stir it again after leaving it out, as the materials get separated in some
    spots.
