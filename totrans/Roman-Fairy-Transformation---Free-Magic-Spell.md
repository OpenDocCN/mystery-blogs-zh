# Roman Fairy Transformation

This spell is not mine, it belongs to Fairy Truths on YouTube. It is a Roman spell to make you a fairy. She has tested it and it did work, however, magic is like the sea, unpredictable, so it may not work the first time.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Roman Fairy Transformation'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Small container

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Small container

*   Water

*   Soap

*   Dead flower petals

*   Fairy Dust

*   Item that means something to you

*   A strand of your hair

*   Wind chimes

 Fill the small container half way with water. Squirt about a tablespoon of soap in. Set the dead flower petals on top of the water. Put a small pinch of Fairy Dust in. Set the item that means something to you in the potion.

Put a loose hair in the potion. Stir until the soap is dissolved and the petals are submerged. Chime the chimes for approximately 10 seconds and lay them on a flat surface. Paint some of the potion, including your hair, on the chimes with a flower petal, keeping the chimes on a flat surface. The hair MUST stick to the chimes.

Double kiss some of your fingers and press them to the chimes for approximately 10 seconds. Chime the chimes as you say the incantation three times. Set the chimes down and spread some of the potion on your forehead with a finger. Dispose of remaining potion and let what is on your forehead dry.

Incantation:
"Oh listen as my sweet wish sings
please grant me my fairy wings
you should listen to my plea
for I am to fly so wild and free"
