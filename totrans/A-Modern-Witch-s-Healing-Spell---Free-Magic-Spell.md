**You will need the following items for this spell:**

 Write the sick person's name upon
a white human-shaped candle of the appropriate gender. As you anoint it with
three drops of myrrh or mint oil, visualize healing energy in the form of
white light flowing from your hands into the candle, and say:

IN THE DIVINE NAME OF THE GODDESS
WHO BREATHES LIFE INTO US ALL
I CONSECRATE AND CHARGE THIS CANDLE
AS A MAGICKAL TOOL FOR HEALING.

Place the candle on top of a photograph of the sick person and then
light the wick. As the candle burns down, concentrate upon the person
in the photograph, willing him or her to be well again, and chant the following incantation:

MAGICK MEND AND CANDLE BURN,
SICKNESS END; GOOD HEALTH RETURN.

Allow the candle to burn out (keep a close eye on it so that it doesn't
run all over or catch anything on fire). Then bury the wax somewhere it will
never be disturbed.
