- en: The first step is to take three drops of the neroli oil, and then drop it into
    the almond oil. Begin to rub the oil on your hands, focusing your thoughts on
    gratitude and empowerment. When you feel calm and focused, light the white candle.
    Sit and meditate, focusing on job opportunities and things you would like for
    your life.

- en: Yes, the 7 is important due to ancient mystical rituals, but if you feel a strong
    sense of focus towards a particular number or symbol, by all means, use that.
    Magic is more about the personal journey than rote performance, after all.

- en: Light the candle, and then stand in front of the altar. What’s important here
    is stating aloud your intentions and desires. There will be a small set of words
    you can say, but as in all magic, it’s more about the personal journey than rote
    performance.

    candles to burn down. As they burn, your intentions are brought into the air on
    sweet smells, while the waste that was carved into the wax is burnt away.
