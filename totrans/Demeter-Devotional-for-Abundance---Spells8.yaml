- en: Demeter is the goddess of agriculture. She is typically represented by an ear
    of wheat. The greatest gifts that Demeter gave the Athenians were the grain, which
    helped men and women abandon the nomadic life, and the Eleusinian mysteries, the
    “most famous of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece”.

    like clay votive pigs, were made as early as in the Neolithic. Her Roman equivalent
    was [Ceres](https://spells8.com/ceres-devotional/).
