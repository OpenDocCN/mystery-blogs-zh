- en: 'With a clear container filled with clean water, mix it with non-iodized salt
    or sea salt. Place your crystals in the container. Next, put the container outside
    on a balcony or on a window sill. Let the full moon recharged the crystal with
    its energy. Let the container sit there throughout the night, then throughout
    the day so the crystals may be recharged with the solar energy as well. Balance
    is key: recharging from the feminine moon and masculine sun energies. After completing
    the cleansing, crystals are fully charged and ready to be used. You may also use
    this method to cleanse your amulets or other possessions. No words are needed,
    but if you like, you may meditate a little or say a few words of your own. Feel
    free to revise the spell to your own comfortability.'
