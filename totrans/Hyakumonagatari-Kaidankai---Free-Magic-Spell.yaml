    \ Kaidankai (more accurately translated as \x93The Gathering of 100 Supernatural\
    \ Tales) has deep roots. Its earliest recorded mention dates back to 1660; it\x92\
    s believed initially to have been a test of courage for samurai, although it has\
    \ filtered down through society over the centuries, evolving into the version\
    \ that\x92s played today in the process. Note that the ritual opens a window into\
    \ the spirit world (which may or may not be the Shadowside)\N but does not specify\
    \ how to close the window once it has been opened."

- en: Dollar store, Walmart, bulk supplier online. Regardless this is a fire hazard
    and nothing else, it sounds as though you are summoning a being that will blow
    open your windows and physically appear before you which wouldn't happen. Perhaps
    you could summon a spirit, but I highly doubt the dramatics this spell claims
    would occur. It just sounds like a fun way to tell ghost stories and to scare
    each other. Just be careful with all those candles.

    with this. And took a while to blow all candles out.

    be sure you protect yourself and you understand how to act around them as well
    as dispel them.
