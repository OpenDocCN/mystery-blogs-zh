 **READ THE SUMMARY FIRST!**

First,find a tree that really speaks to you.If you're element earth,then,it's easy.The tree that youre about to find really wants to be a guardian.Then say this :

> **"Divine Trees born from the earth please hear my voice,this sacred place needs a guardian to stay and a place to live in.So please be the one who shall invoke thee."**

2:After you find one,place one of your hand and say "Please be the tree of the god",imagine there's a green flowing energy from the below to the top then it's creating a wide open eye called " all seeing eye".After that,imagine a barrier builds between the tree.

You're done!
When it's night,they'll attack the demons around them/attack the ghost/attack the dark things.
When the sentinels has fallen,the tree will fall.
The spell last forever and the rensponsibility goes to them.
