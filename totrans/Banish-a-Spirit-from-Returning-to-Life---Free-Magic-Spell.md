Slice the knife through the air and leave it in your hand

Stop the rhythm and slice through the drum skin then drop the knife beside the drum

> Walk with the dead forever, Walk with the living never,

Blow out the candle and then the spell is done

Seeming fortunate to the unknown.but rather dying to the desead

This seems far too simplistic to work. If this was a full coven and you had more items, say the deceased personal items, then it might work, but I highly doubt you can stop the reincarnation process.
