# Recipe for a good offering

Some rituals (actually most) require an offering. But sometimes you don't know what to use. This is a simple recipe for a suitable offering for any spirit!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Recipe for a good offering'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A few leaves of kitchen herbs (think rosemary, basil, thyme, etc)

*   1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice

*   1/4 cup of water (preferably fresh like rainwater or riverwater, but tapwater works fine too. Or, you could make moon/sun/holy water if you think it would please the spirits more!)

*   1 tsp of salt

*   1 tsp of onion powder

*   1 tbsp of garlic powder

*   Mortar and pestle

*   small bowl

*   spoon

*   Anything else you think the spirits would like!

 Add the herbs into the mortar and pestle and begin to grind them. Pause to add the salt in, then continue. Add the garlic and pumpkin pie spice in at the same time (keep grinding)! Finally, the onion powder. As you grind envision all your energy pouring into the mortar and pestle.

By the time you're done, it's okay if some of the herbs aren't full crushed. Mine wasn't, and the dragons I was working with liked it fine.

Pour the mix into the bowl and add the water. Stir it with a spoon. This would be a good time to add anything else you think the spirits would like.

Leave it out overnight to collect moonlight. Or if you're doing this in the middle of the night for some reason leave it out over day. (Or, if you used holy water, moon water, or sun water, you don't need to leave it out.) You might need to stir it again after leaving it out, as the materials get separated in some spots.

Voila! You now have a suitable offering to the spirits!
