- en: Here is a simple technique for dealing with negative energies such as anger
    and resentment. It uses the Elements and their qualities in a very positive way.
    The circle of light links with spirit, the dark stone represents Earth and the
    water acts in its cleansing capacity.

    items for this spell:** Visualize a circle of light around yourself. Hold the
    dark stone in your hands. Place it over your solar plexus. Allow the negative
    emotion, perhaps anger -and resentment, to flow into the stone. Try to decide
    what colour the emotion is, and how it arose in the first place. It sometimeshelps
    to counteract such an emotion bychanging its colour.'

    all your negative emotion (anger, resentment etc) into thestone. Visualize the
    emotion being sealed inside the stone. Take the stone to a source of running water
    in -the open air and with all your energy throw it as far as you can. It also
    helps if you can get up to a high place to throw your stone away, since this way
    you -are using Air as well.

    a rock on the ground. But, I would still consider using a crystal with cleansing
    or healing properties. If you choose to use water to cleanse it, make sure the
    crystal will not be damaged by the water. You can also use sunlight and moonlight
    to cleanse your crystals, but again, make sure they will not be damaged.

    again, or that a single attempt will end the negative cycle you wish to break.
    This would require regular workings. It also does not mean you will never feel
    these emotions. It is utilizing your chakra and the crystal to help you heal.
    There are no negative emotions, just how society perceives them and how you react
    to them. This spell should help you work through these blocks and find healthy
    outlets for them.
