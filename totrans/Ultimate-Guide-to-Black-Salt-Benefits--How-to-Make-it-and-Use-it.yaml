    circle, imbued with salt circle meaning, to establish a protective perimeter or
    magical boundary - **protective barrier**. This can be done by sprinkling black
    salt around your home or the area you wish to protect. You can also sprinkle it
    around your belongings or even around yourself to ward off negative energies.

    performing.

    bag. You can then add any herbs, crystals or other ingredients that are relevant
    to the spell or ritual you are performing. Once the charm is made, you can carry
    it with you or place it near a window or door to ward off bad energy.

    simply add a little pinch of black salt to a warm bath and soak in it for a few
    minutes. This will help to clear away any negative energies. **As Black salt contains
    ashes and black pepper, do not add too much, just a pinch is completely sufficient.** We
    are working with energies rather than quantities.
