  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The word Supermoon is not an official astronomical term. It was first created
    by an astrologer named, Richard Nolle, in 1979\. He defined it as ‘a New or a
    Full Moon that occurs when the Moon is at or near (within 90% of) its closest
    approach to Earth in its orbit’. It is not clear why he chose the 90% cut off
    in his definition.

- en: New moon represents the end of one cycle and the beginning of another new 28-day
    cycle. In astronomy, the new moon is when the sun and moon are aligned, with the
    sun and earth on opposite sides of the moon. It is the beginning of a new lunar
    cycle, and it’s a great time to begin a new personal cycle as well; a time to
    turn over a new leaf or start a new project.

- en: During a new moon, the moon is not visible in the sky. This typically means
    the energy available is low. People often report feeling tired and drained during
    a new moon. This is a perfect opportunity to become self-reflective, to look inward.
    This is an ideal time to really think about want you want in life acknowledge
    your goals, set clear intentions towards those goals, and write to-do lists. A
    time for a fresh start, and to let go of those things in your life that no longer
    serve you.

    star Arcturus.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fixed star Spica gives success, renown, riches, sweet disposition, love of art
    and science, unfruitfulness, and injustice to innocence. It brings good fortune
    to scientist, artists, and musicians. Spica also gives spiritual and religious
    qualities, with above average psychic awareness.

- en: Fixed star Arcturus gives riches, honors, high renown, self-determination, and
    prosperity. However, Arcturus has a reputation for achieving justice through power.
    Which can make people become belligerent and quarrelsome.

- en: New moon, October 16, opposite Mars may cause anger, impulsiveness, and hostility.
    The new moon, Saturn can cause disappointment, delays, and frustration. The new
    moon square Pluto can cause extremism, intensity, and a callous quest for power.
    The combination of the planetary characteristics creates a highly dynamic energy.
    With determination, hard work and persistence you will be able to achieve your
    specific goals and intentions. If your focus is solely on achieving power, then
    conflict will surely be your end result.
