- en: Families go through good and bad times. Most of the time, the bad times end
    quickly and the good times keep rolling. However, it isn’t outside of the realm
    of possibility that an argument could cause relationships within a family to become
    strained. In these instances, it often seems like nothing will help to restore
    peace. This spell is most valuable what that happens. Cast it on a Friday evening.

    or rose essential oil and morning glory (or meadowsweet, violets, tuberose).

- en: When all your other family members are in bed, head to your sacred space and
    consecrate the ingredients. Once you are finished, light the candle. Watch the
    flame. As it gains strength, visualize feelings of happiness and peace flowing
    through your home. Take your time. There is no need for this to be over quickly.
    Instead, see the visualization through to the end.

- en: Add either the rose quartz or the essential oil to the water. Raise the blooms
    to the flame of the candle and observe as they fill with love and happiness. Once
    that process is complete, bring the flowers and the water with you as you circle
    through the entire house. Walk around the exterior of the property as well. As
    you walk, moisten the flowers and sprinkle droplets on your short journey. Be
    especially careful to do this in the places where a lot of arguing takes place.
    For example, the kitchen seems to be a hot spot for many families. In addition
    to undertaking this task, say the following words as well.
