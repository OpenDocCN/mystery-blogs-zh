- en: Remove your arms from around yourself, and meditate in front of the candles,
    5 minutes at least. Think to yourself of all your positive and negative qualities.
    Be completely honest with yourself, no matter how much you rather NOT think of
    your negative qualities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During this meditation accept yourself completely, the good, the bad, and even
    the ugly. Balance cannot be attained when within yourself there is unbalance of
    yourself, when you do not accept your negative qualities you end up accepting
    more of your positive qualities. Think of it like having good on one side of the
    scale, and bad on the other, and you pushing your finger on the good side to make
    it win in weight. Let these two equal out, because without one, there is no other.
    So unless you plan on completely cancelling out your good and bad qualities, this
    spell is a keeper!
