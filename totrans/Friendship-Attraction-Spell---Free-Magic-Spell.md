 Day 1: Write a spell inspired by the first fandom or character that made you interested in pop culture magic kikis delivery service! lets be honest, when isnt it kiki or sabrina the teenage witch that got us into pop culture magic, once we discovered it?

Whenever kiki left her home for the city, she had a tough time making friends. feels an awful lot like me now that I go to a different school. honestly, its pretty hard making friends here! so why not cook up a little friendship attraction spell?

A friend is all I need, not to sound full of greed. A platonic relationship anew, is all I need with you. Come forth and take your place, for you, there is plenty of space. you neednt say So mote it be with this spell, but if youd like, you can end with that! just as you dont need any candles or crystals, but can use them.
