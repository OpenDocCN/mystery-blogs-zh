    are with the internet, but how does this play out with magick?*  A lot of aspiring
    magicians spend their time on social media, and there is no problem with this.
    But, as you learn in the occult, too much of something can eventually lead to
    an imbalance, therefore, we need to pay attention to this so we don''t limit our
    experience in life or compromise what we want with anything less.'

    a bunch of different things at the same time, it may not lead to the most consistent
    outcome.

- en: Therefore, it's really important, in magick, to make **a budget for your attention**,
    so to speak, and to cut out mindless "spending habits" when it comes to your thoughts,
    so that you have more focus to put towards accomplishing what you want.

- en: Let me give you an example. I took a trip to Barcelona. It was incredible, but
    one thing about it was different from my normal day. When I went on my phone to
    look at whatever AI curated content would come up, it wasn't interesting. In fact,
    **I felt like I could barely bring myself to use my phone at all**. I only took
    one quick glance, now and then, to see that there was nothing really that interesting
    going on and it even made me realize things that I may not have thought about
    in such a way normally by seeing it from a different perspective. I will avoid
    going further into existentialism, but, mainly, I realized that I'm the one on
    vacation and I'm supposed to be having fun, not on my phone!

    news and everything continues **perpetuating the same stories in the same cycles**,
    and things can get stuck in a routine that becomes normalized, but then, one day,
    your life changes, and, suddenly, everything else seems boring in comparison because
    you're the one having fun and doing something different and exciting.  It helped
    me realize that sometimes we get so used to the way our life is that we check
    social media or watch random stuff on YouTube to help break up the pattern of
    the day, even if we have fun and love what we do. And can even become hypnotized
    by it until we lose sight of the important things. But, when we should be having
    fun, we definitely should focus on that! Because if we spent our time looking
    at what other people were doing, it probably wouldn't mean we were having that
    much of a good time.

- en: Let's, then, look at **distractions as something that doesn't align you with
    your goal**. It could very well be that something very useful that seemed like
    a distraction, at first, could actually be in alignment with whatever you want
    to manifest in life and could even be something that you attracted to help your
    manifestation on its way. Therefore, distractions are sometimes subjective, as
    we can use our intuition to figure out which ones are helpful to us in this sense.  Thus,
    we have to budget again so that we make time for certain things that are important.
    Sometimes distractions can be ok, if you can turn them into something that serves
    your purpose - to learn or to motivate you to achieve your goal. Then they aren't
    distractions anymore. And if we can occasionally do this for an amount of time
    that we previously assessed is profitable, and then put our attention back into
    what we're focusing on, then all the better.

    enjoy being distracted by things. If that's the case, then it becomes entertainment.
    Or they may want something that, to them, might not seem as distracting as it
    may seem to you. Whatever the case may be, having direct focus on your goal is
    a practice in itself.  And it all depends how you combine that focus with how
    you use time.

- en: The point is to learn how to **enjoy life in the moment**, and to make the most
    out of your current experience because, if you're too focused on wanting other
    things, how will you truly enjoy what you want once you finally get it? When there
    are so many other things that you also want instead? Therefore, learn to find
    a balance between working towards what you want and enjoying life in the moment.
    Eventually, one day, the two will meet.  Matthew
