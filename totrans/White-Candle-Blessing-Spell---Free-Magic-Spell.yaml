    one in the gender of the person you want to bless. Carve the person''s full name
    on the candle, then dress it with Blessing Oil or Holy Oil. For more power, you
    may place a name-paper of the person, or a photo, or some personal item of theirs
    (such as a bit of hair or a snippet of clothing) either under the candle or next
    to it. One easy way to do this is to place the paper or personal concerns under
    an overturned saucer and put the candle on top of the saucer. Burn a portion of
    the candle every day for seven days, pinching it out between burnings. As you
    light it each day, say this:'

    get a good job, come home safely from a war, or whatever), just add it to the
    list. Some people use a large pillar-type candle and keep it going for longer
    than seven days. They may make a habit of burning such a candle every day -- or
    once a week, on Sundays -- for as long as their friend or relative needs help,
    even doing so for months at a time. If the candle is large and it is to be burned
    in this way, it should be re-dressed with Blessing Oil or Holy Oil once a week:
    after the initial dressing, you can drop a tiny bit of oil into the "well" or
    hole in such a large candle just before lighting it each time.'

    from the church (holy water)?
  prefs: []

- en: I personally wouldn't use water, as it will effect the way the candle burns.
    You can create your own dressing oil, by charging olive oil, or you can fully
    create blessing/holy oil with a recipe and steeping herbs in the oil for several
    weeks. Oils aren't a requirement in candle work, if you don't have the oil, your
    intention should be enough.
