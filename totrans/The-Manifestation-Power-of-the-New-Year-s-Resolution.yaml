    resolution, but, with this seemingly magical act, they do so without realizing
    the principles of the New Years resolution itself. Lets have a look at the m*anifestation
    Power of the New Year''s Resolution.'

- en: The New Year has this **monumental energy** that comes with it that helps people
    feel that they can overcome their resistance to whatever they want, yet this kind
    of feeling should continue to be cultivated long after the spell has worn off
    for most people.

    without requiring the collective assistance of others helping them. To be enough
    by themselves.

- en: People tend to lack the initiative to do something without someone else doing
    it first. Thus, this initial burst leads to people clammering to start something
    like everyone else, at the same time, but whose effort wanes with the tide. You
    need to not be like those people, but to train yourself, to separate yourself
    from this way of dependently going along with things as if it could be a strategy
    that could work or get successful results on its own.

    no one will see the difference in it from anyone else.

- en: You also want to be more independent and free from any other currents but your
    own desires, so you're not just going along with other people. Thus, the initial
    creative burst comes and you can ride with it like everyone else, not going against
    the current, but when people stagnate as they will or lose motivation, you need
    to maintain pursuing your desire well into its completion and beyond it.

    have the drive to successfully carry it out?"

    is to be filled up with creative desire that always grows until the full moon
    or the next full moons until it can be reaped.

- en: And just as a lot of businesses don't succeed, neither will some people's manifestations
    if they don't carry them out, not only to their completion, but continue to build
    and expand further beyond even the original concepts that they conceived, which
    are learned through experience of pursuing it.

- en: Let us contemplate these kinds of principles and use them to our advantage in
    the coming year ahead. To rise, not only with the collective tides, but to take
    our own initiative, to "turn the tide" if we have to, and to reap the rewards
    along the way.
