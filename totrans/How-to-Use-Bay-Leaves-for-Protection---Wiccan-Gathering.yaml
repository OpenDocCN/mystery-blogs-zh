    also known as the prosperity plant or wishing plant. You may know it already from
    its common culinary uses.

    about the intention you’d like to manifest. Include other herbs into the spell
    if needed, such as sage for cleansing.*   To channel energy into the leaf, focus
    on your intention while holding it. You can also meditate. There’s no right or
    wrong way to do this. What’s important is believing in the outcome and adopting
    a positive mental state. Do what feels comfortable. *   Light the candle.*   Stare
    at the flame while going into a meditative state. Visualize your manifestation—how
    it looks, sounds, smells, and feels.*   After successfully visualizing a clear
    image, write your intention on the bay leaf.*   To release the energy, burn the
    leaf, letting the flame ignite your intention and propel it out to the universe
    through the smoke.*   Drop the leaf into the heat-proof container. Once the entire
    leaf is burnt, offer a prayer of thanks and put out the flame.*   Discard the
    ashes outside your spell venue. Some look at the ashes as symbols of banished
    negative energy, and so you may want to dispose of them permanently away from
    the home. Others view ashes as previous threats or dangers that have now been
    vanquished and can no longer harm them, so this may make you feel comfortable
    disposing of the ashes in your home.
