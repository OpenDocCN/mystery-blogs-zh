# Spirit Catalog: Doppelgangers

Like the first catalog, I will now share our info on Doppelgangers.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Spirit Catalog: Doppelgangers'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**-Name:
Doppelganger

-Type:
Demonic/Guardian/Native

-Abilities:

Copycat- This is a Doppelganger's main ability, they copy the appearance, voice, attitude, and others about a certain person.

-Weapon of choice:
They have no weapon, what they use is their ability to copy people to either help or destroy in a situation.

Description:
These are the most difficult to distinguish not just because they copy your image but because they can be one of three beings; they can be demonic these will want to hurt you, guardians they copy you in times of danger to ask for assistance or warn of impending danger, and lastly native they copy as a warning, do not go near their territory. Doppelgangers are a handful, not knowing what they are it becomes difficult knowing how to deal with it, normally they will have weaknesses if they are demonic or native.

*Note Doppelgangers are spirit manifestations, which means they can hurt you, it may not be physical but in other ways.
