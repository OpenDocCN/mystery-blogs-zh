    from hell. It is wise to contact spirits with high experience and knowledge to
    get their advice on casting it.

    hurting yourself or getting dizzy/tired) out of your self in a sort of "bubble"
    around you. Next, concentrate with all your might on 3 things: keeping your energy
    around you, black flames appearing in a circle around you, and a lightning storm
    above you. You may feel a rumbling sensation deep in your bones; that is because
    you may have not handled magick of this power before. Don''t worry; if you have
    enough experience and know how all magick behaves, you WILL NOT be harmed.'

    That feeling is the magickal black flames conjured up from hell. Since they were
    conjured by YOUR energy, they will not affect YOU.

    of lightning down, creating a cage made of lightning around you. That is the lightning
    shield; it will move with you if you walk around. Do note, however, that illusion
    spells can still pass through, if they are powerful enough. If you are trapped
    in an illusion the spell will fall apart and you will lose about 70% of the energy
    you used. The rest will go back inside you. That is pretty much all there is to
    it, except the fact that the lightning shield will sometimes send outward small
    bolts that hurt.

    just as an ultimate defense. If you ever decide to cast this spell, I wish you
    all the luck.
