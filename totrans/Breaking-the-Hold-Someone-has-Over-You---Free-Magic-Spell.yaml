- en: This spell owes a lot to visualisation and the use of colour and in many ways
    is a learning experience in trusting your own abilities. It can be used in emotional
    situations, where you feel someone is taking advantage of you, or when you are
    bound to someone by perhaps a false sense of duty. This technique can be done
    in more than one sitting, particularly if you do not want any changes to be too
    dramatic.

- en: Your image must be one that you feel you can relate to fully. Perhaps the easiest
    to see is in the form of a rope joining the two of you together. If you are good
    at seeing colour then the best to use is something similar to iridescent mother
    of pearl, because that contains all colours. You might see the image as a rigid
    bar, which would suggest that there is an inflexibility in the relationship between
    you which may require you to deal with the expectations of others.

    this is just between you and your perception of the link you have with the other
    person. Light your incense and sit quietly, considering carefully the link between
    you.

- en: Become aware of the flow of energy between you and gently withdraw your own
    energy, seeing it returning to you and being used for your own purposes rather
    than the other persons. (This may be enough to bring about a change in your relationship
    which has a satisfactory outcome for you.)

- en: Next think carefully about how the other person makes calls on your time and
    energy - whether these are physical, emotional or spiritual. Resolve that you
    will either not allow this to happen or will be more careful and sparing in your
    responses. You might develop a symbol for yourself which you can use when you
    feel you are being sucked in. Preferably use one which amuses you, since laughter
    is a potent tool. You could use the image of a knot being tied, a cork or a stopcock.

- en: If you decide that you no longer wish to be associated with the person, use
    a technique which signifies breaking the link. It will depend upon your own personality
    and that of the other person as to how you do this. Visualizing the link simply
    being cut may bring about a more powerful ending with tears and recriminations,
    whereas a gentle teasing out of the link may be slower but less painful.

- en: It is here that you must trust your own judgement with the thought that it must
    be done for the Greater Good. If therefore you feel that at least some links must
    be left in place you can do this, for instance if you would wish to know when
    the other person is in trouble.

    you. Always ensure that you leave them with a blessing for their continuing health,
    wealth and happiness.

- en: Now you will only become involved with them at your own wish. You can see from
    the above that at all points you have a choice for your course of action. This
    is because each stage must be considered very carefully, and not done in anger.
    You must remain as dispassionate as you can and always remain true to your own
    principles.

    Depending on how strong your connection to the other person is, you might have
    to repeat this a few times.
