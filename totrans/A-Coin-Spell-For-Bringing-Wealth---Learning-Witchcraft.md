If is best to do this spell with Leo in the ascendant on a Sunday. Avoid weaving the spell while the moon is waning. Before making magic, if you take a bath, add three drops worth of rose essential oil into your bath water. Then after you dry off, put on something special.

**You are going to need the following:**

A pencil and piece of paper
Your wallet or purse
Jewelry inlaid with rubies, jade or diamonds
A dish full of silver coins
A dish full of salt
Small piece of coal
One white altar candle
One yellow taper candle
One or two silver or gold objects

Light your white candle and kneel in front of your altar Meditate about the current financial position you are in. No matter how bad things might be, visualize yourself placing money in your bank account, and one by one paying all of your creditors off.

Now light your yellow candle, and write down the amount of money you think you are going to need to pay all of your debts off, and then an extra amount for a special treat. Just don’t ask for the impossible. Take the yellow candle and use its flame to light the paper on fire that you wrote the sum of money on. Then drop the paper into your fireproof dish. Watch the smoke carrying your wishes up to the deity that you have dedicated your altar to.

Imagine yourself bathed in gold sunlight, stand at full height with your arms outstretched over your head and say the following:

*Coins sparkling in the sun,*
*Please come to men when my work is done,*
*Make me rich so that I might see,*
*Plenty of wealth come to me.*
*Let this be done, and let it harm no one.*

Extinguish the candle gently or allow it to burn down, before you close your ritual.
