- en: Take your object and charge it overnight/day. If you are charging it by the
    moon, leave it in direct moonlight or by your windowsill overnight. If you are
    charging it by the sun, do so over day. If you are charging it in dirt, fire products,
    water, air, or any other element based item, do so in whatever way you generally
    do, or immerse it in said item for as long as you wish. If you are using an appendage/body
    part, consider doing so during a bath or another related time.  Once your item
    is charged sufficiently (as per your wishes, but recommended to be nine hours/minutes/seconds)
    you may proceed onto the next part.

- en: This next section is not necessary but it is recommended. Soak your item in
    a wash of salt and water, for at least nine seconds, but extend as long as you
    wish, and then pat dry with yourself or a towel or such. Then do the same with
    Epsom salts. When they are dry, hold it in your casting hand (whichever hand you
    feel is dominant in casting this spell) and meditate on your intentions. If you
    cannot do this because you have enchanted your body, then you must meditate but
    not hold the object. You many then proceed.

    (but know you do not need the corresponding herb(s) to make the spell work. Putting
    in whichever herbs you find work best for you also is encouraged.):'

    you can also choose to use whichever you prefer. Once completed, you may redo
    the "ritual" with the salts, but this time, do the reverse, putting Epsom salts
    before the table salts.

- en: Keep this item close to you when you need the effects. If you can form a connection
    without it, do not worry about keeping it close by. Do not ingest any of the ingredients
    unless you know they are edible. Aloe Vera, many varieties of cactus, most thorns,
    and many herbs are not safe to ingest (at least in large quantities) and you could
    be gravely harmed.
