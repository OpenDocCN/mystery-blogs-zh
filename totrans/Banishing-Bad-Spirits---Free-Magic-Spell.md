# Banishing Bad Spirits - Free Magic Spell

> 来源：[https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/banishing_spells/25948/page.html#0001-01-01](https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/banishing_spells/25948/page.html#0001-01-01)

 Here is what I have to say, and here are the instructions that I will give you.

These are the things that Jehovah, the God of Armies, hates.

Galatians 5:19

Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct,

Galatians 5:20

idolatry, spiritism, hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects,

Galatians 5:21

envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and things like these. I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God's Kingdom.

These are on the other hand, are things that he loves.

Galatians 5:22

On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,

Galatians 5:23

mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.

Have faith, and pray here in a way that I pray.

"Oh Jehovah, the one true living God, please help me deal with these wicked spirits that I've been accursed by. PLEASE grant me Holy Spirit to deal with these problems. I would like to ask for forgiveness of my sins and mistakes by Christ Jesus' ransom sacrifice, and in his name I would like to ask for all things and pray. Amen. So let it be."

However, prayer to Jehovah the God of Armies, the God of Love, is a privilege. Try your best to only pray to him and no one else, and to follow his conduct as I previously stated from his Bible. It is my prayer that you, dear reader, find this and have a happier, healthier life.

Also, try to avoid praying for what you want, pray for Jehovah's Spirituality or Holy Spirit to be with you to make decisions to make him happy, and pray for the poor, the crippled, the lame. Once you've become closer to Jehovah God, he may begin to speak to you. Be sure to listen to what he says, because if you do not he may grow indignant with you because he's only trying to help you. Pray constantly for whatever issue you may face, and try to avoid things he does not approve of and try and gather together as much as you can of what he does approve of, such as the following : love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, and self-control. Be sure to pray for what you believe is right after praying for his spirit to guide you, and only then after you gather a bunch of those good qualities would I recommend to pray for what you want.

Whatever you do, do not curse Him, do not hate Him, and do not pray for your will, but for his.

I pray for you now that you will find this and this will help you in your daily lives, because it's helped me. I hope that you will continue walking in faith with Jehovah, the God of Love. Amen. So let it be.
