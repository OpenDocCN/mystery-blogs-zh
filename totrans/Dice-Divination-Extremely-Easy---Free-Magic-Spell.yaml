    open up your hands to stare at the dice. Breathe on them, while visualizing light
    coming from a natural power source (An element, a spirit animal, or a planet [I
    use the moon] are some options), entering your head, and swirling down around
    your arms and into the dice. Cup your hands once more to seal in the energy. Remain
    like this for about 10 seconds before saying:'

    aloud or thinking strongly about a question, for example, 'Will I get married
    soon' or even something of gossip, such as 'Will my favorite author publish a
    new book soon'. Other people can ask you to ask questions as well, they just cannot

- en: Consider the positive outcomes as yes [such as if you roll a 3, 5, 10, 17 and
    18] and I'm not sure what you mean ''can questions lead to answer'' it's a divination
    tool, it gives vague solutions because the future is always changing [simply having
    the reading can be enough to alter the future] so if you get an answer you wanted,
    continue on your current path. If you didn't like the answer, change your current
    path.

- en: This is a form of divination, not a spell. Bless the dice and use them only
    for divination. You do not need to pray or call on a deity before using them.
    Once they are blessed as a divination tool, you would retrieve them, focus on
    your question, then toss them and receive your answer.

    Any dice inside the circle is used in the divination. If they both land on 1,
    or only 1 lands inside the circle, it would be viewed as ''inconclusive at this
    time'' and you would need to think of a new question, new phrasing for your question,
    or wait a day to ask again.
