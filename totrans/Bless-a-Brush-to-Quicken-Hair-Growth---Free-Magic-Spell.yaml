- en: First, cast your circle (If you do not know how to do this, then Google "How
    to cast a circle." It's pretty simple.) Make sure your circle is purified and
    then call in the elements. Now, please dip your hand in the olive oil and begin
    anointing your candle with it. As you anoint it, imagine your hair growing to
    your desired length. Do not skip this part. Visualization is vital in spell-casting.

    and sprinkle some salt in it, saying, "With this salt, I purify this water. May
    this water bless all it touches and may it fulfill my desires." Dip your hands
    in the water and sweep them over your hair, dampening it. Now, take the rose and
    hold it up, saying, "Oh, Goddess Aphrodite. Goddess of Beauty and Love, please
    help me to grow my hair to its desired length. Please bless me and this symbol
    with your infinite love, desire, and beauty."

    off the petals and sprinkle them in. Whatever works best for you is fine. When
    you are finished with this, pick up your cup of earth and pour it into the cup,
    mixing it diesel (clock-wise) with your power hand (whatever hand you write with).
    As you stir it, say, "May the Mother Goddess bless this water and bring to me
    the beauty that she has created on this earth. May she fulfill my desires."

- en: Now, take the feather and drop it into the water. Say, "May the winds bless
    this water and bring to me all that I desire. Please, let my hair grow to its
    desired length." Next, take the candle and drop it into the water, letting the
    liquid put out its flame. Say, "Fire that burns with beauty and brightness, fulfill
    my desires and make my hair grow longer." Now, last but not least, drop the brush
    into the water while saying, "Let this brush absorb the energy of the elements
    and the blessings of the Goddesses. May my hair grow longer. As I will it, so
    mote it be."

- en: Hold both of your hands over the mixture and imagine a light of energy pouring
    into the water, coming from your hands. You can summon this energy by imagining
    roots sprouting from your body and going into the earth, pulling the energy up
    and then traveling through your body and into the water. Your body will act as
    a vessel. Do this for a few minutes. After, pull out the brush and brush it through
    your hair as many times as you can. This process differs from person to person.
    Some might have to brush loner than others. Just brush as long as it feels right
    to.

- en: After you have brushed your hair, sit it on your dresser and every night before
    bed until the moon is once again full, brush you hair with it. After the spell,
    close your circle and wash your hair with the remaining mixture. It will be muddy
    ad gross, but it will be worth it, I promise. Good luck casting your spell :)

- en: Too much. Hold the brush, charge it with energy while visualizing your hair
    growing longer. Perhaps say a chant, something like ''with this brush my hair
    will grow, longer and longer, it will flow'' then repeat the chant each time you
    brush you hair. You will not wake up with hair as long as Rapunzel's over night,
    but if your hair grows an inch on average, you might see an inch and a half of
    growth after the spell.
