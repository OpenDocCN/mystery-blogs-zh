- en: Once you are sure you know what exactly the prophetic dream should be able,
    you can gather your items and prepare your working. Lay out a square of pale blue
    cloth. In the middle, places a mixture of ash leaves, bay leaves, cinquefoil,
    heliotrope, holly, jasmine flowers, marigold flowers, mimosa, mugwort, onion,
    and/or yarrow (however many you can find). Bring the corners towards the middle
    and tie it all together like a small bag with a string, ribbon, or piece of yarn.
    Then, on a white piece of paper, briefly explain what you need to see in the dream,
    using the guideline above to tell the main ideas/questions you need prophecies
    about.

    it. Use what you learn to prepare you for the future.
