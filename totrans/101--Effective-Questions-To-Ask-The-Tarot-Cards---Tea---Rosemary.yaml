- en: I practice with my Tarot cards almost daily, so I know how hard it is to actually
    think of questions to ask the Tarot cards. Once you’ve gone through all the main
    issues, you’ve run out of queries, but you may still want to practice.

    own practice, I decided to put together this post of 101+ questions for the Tarot
    cards!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open-ended questions are always better when thinking of questions to ask the
    Tarot cards. While you *can* work with the Tarot if you want to produce a yes
    or no answer, it’s better to use open-ended questions for practice. Therefore,
    all 101 examples of questions to ask the Tarot cards are open-ended.

- en: Additionally, try to ask questions that you actually have control over. For
    example, don’t ask what your friend can do to make *you* happier, since you have
    no control over whether or not your friend does it. Take back your control and
    empower yourself with these Tarot questions!

- en: Lastly, if you’re just learning Tarot, use a deck that’s good for beginners.
    [I recommend this classic deck](https://rstyle.me/+o41WAvvI9nX5E1W9zZ-azg) for
    absolute beginners.
