- en: This spell will teach you how to enchant and create your own Symbol, a powerful
    object that will strengthen your magical abilities. The most important part is
    to believe in yourself, and that will give your Symbol the most strength. Remember,
    the Symbol will represent you. If you are close with water, then you will have
    a much easier time, as this spell has been passed down from many generations.
    Good luck with the spell!

    thousands of years old, passed down from a great siren, the first siren, Syrena.

    attract your love to you. Show your love your Symbol, if you can. The closer the
    Symbol is to the person, the more potent it is!
