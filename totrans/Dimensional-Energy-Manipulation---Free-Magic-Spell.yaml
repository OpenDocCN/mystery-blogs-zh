- en: I have researched the energys of our world and being. We are all omni-dimensional
    beings made in the image of the creator, the one key speicies to all worlds. Inner
    connections to these dimensions are within our minds, truely we know nothing of
    our brain construction because we look with no reason in mind. I have made several
    spells before that made no sense as I actually did not intend to put it out yet
    as I first put in information.

- en: Now I have it ready... The representations of colors remain true, they are the
    energys of our aura and intentions. One dimension of vision gifted by the pineal
    gland with the crystal formed in the center. It produces most the DMT in your
    mind. Using it the crystal projects the lights in our vision to show more with
    more DMT. It is basically an eye and you can see it open. This allows you to see
    the colors of power. Other dimensions I need studie more to know how we see. You
    can see the force of a kii ball and healing energys which are other dimensions.

- en: Kii balls, better known as psi or force balls, are composed of a constant energy
    flow from our hands and through our chakras. Studie them and yourself. We can
    use our willpower to move sorounding energy into the energy balls. And using the
    proper geometry we can change and create in our world. Or so it seems, reaching
    other realms to pull in energy and change reality. Willpower is put in belief
    and belief worps reality. This is what many call our ''gift from god'' because
    only humans posses this at the hight of our evolution.

- en: Outside our auras most of us can't see the rushing major amounts of energy.
    Our own energy constantly manipulate it to have a feeling and color pattern healers
    often use without seeing this energy. It is also what flows through many cristals
    and rocks. Cristal healers use this along with a force based energy. The psi balls
    can be morphed to healing energy between your hands with shaping them flat and
    slightly inward arced and the feeling of calm, love, heat. Physical heat van be
    felt from that when done properly.

- en: Another dimension is the shadow realm... Exists in the shadows and best in the
    shadow of the Earth. We unintentionally make demons here all the time that follow
    us and can be seen. You can sharpen you vision to see them all. It has a direct
    connection to the austral plane and the betrayer's demons posses our demons to
    reach us through them. Show people then begin to appear. The shadow realm is harmless
    to humans though, only if you let it in you mind can it do damage. Shadow magic
    and the shadow realm are a result of our universes colliding. It expanded and
    now it all comes back together. Heaven and Earth are the final collision. For
    the far future though... Many get shadow magic and dark magic confused. Dark magic
    has been around for a long time.

- en: Energy produced(or transmuted) by your chakras change and have the reactions
    in our mortal plane dependant on your willpower's choice. Emotion and colors from
    your aura and any other corisponding energy to do whatever you want. Crack into
    other dimensions effect peoples moods and even enchant. The PSI ball not only
    can be formed between thou's hands but also off other objects. And this will give
    a slight push just like you feel in a psi ball. Test it on paper and then even
    use psi serges to move things and bigger objects. This is called telikanisis.

- en: Enchanting is the filling of energy with intentions into a object. The same
    as Alchemy, in the potion aspect anyway. Alchemy is much more complicated and
    baised off spiritual evolution. Enchanting is like this as it involves a energy
    reconstruction guided by willpower's intention. Your own energy and the energy
    of the room can be used. So learning to fill a room with a energy essence can
    be essential. Light energy can be used too. Natural sources are used for this
    like them moon and the Sun. The sun is for experienced energy manipulatists. The
    moon is a powerful easy to use energy to enchant with. The moon means to strengthen,
    sharpen(not physically but on blades it give unexplainable kinetic energy), and
    speed up in darkness.

- en: The colors are important for making portals to other planes and dimensional
    realms. The shapes made by the brain thought process make a change to the energys
    on every dimension. The geometrys are a power that applys to all energy working
    forward the same cause for each shape. That is the first line of command nodes.
    Similar to how numbers apply to a computer program. The Triangle represents fire,
    fire represents change. Which makes sense as to why many don't like change, we
    must change in fire.

- en: The art of runes is composing shapes to represent other shapes that are cast
    a dimensional level. With practice one can see. The cast command is the shapes
    on the ''console dimension'' the runes command these directly. Each rune school
    has a different system that activates these ''console dimension'' shapes. Most
    are programmed by a human mortal preforming the shapes in their brain matrix.
    Just like enchanting, mixing potions, making energys, it all uses the ''console
    dimension.'' Most know to use this with intention, manifestation of thought. What
    this ''console dimension'' does is to be explained later. Until then it is your
    equation to hack, see, own.

    that believe they are worthy, and need to use ''raw power magic''(a destruction
    magic) should contact me... or if you think you know what it is, as it is a worthy
    discussion for knowledge. If you have never heard of it and find no grand or crucial
    reason to use it then you may not be worthy of such information.

- en: 'I was expecting it to be funnier given the description (New to Disney parks
    ''''magic: The Science of Tomorrow'''') but it was just the ramblings of someone
    who wishes to sound enlightened. Magik on the physical is a force of nature. There
    are deities who specialize in Magik, but Magik does not come from any one god,
    it comes from nature. Hence why you do not need to work with a deity to practice
    Magik. You cannot defy natural law on the physical plane because Magik is a natural
    force. Magik is not good or evil, it certain is not black or white. It is a neutral
    force that gains a charge by interacting with us. Black Magik is not automatically
    evil, and white Magik is not therefore automatically good. This is a long held
    misconception. Magik is Magik. If you wish to go to the shadow realm (as seen
    in Yu-Gi-Oh) or other planes of existence, you can through astral projection and
    deep forms of mediation. You do not create a really powerful psi ball and enter
    another dimension. Since you briefly touched on Alchemist, I feel I should mention
    they are not higher beings, they are ancient chemists and the practice is still
    around today, though certain beliefs have changed over time. Sacred Geometry,
    colour correspondences and enchanting objects are all real concepts, but are not
    higher powers to unlocking the keys to other dimensions as you seem to claim.
    Runes gain their power form spirits associated with each rune. Working with the
    runes is like working with a spiritual being like a fae, mermaid, or other spirit.
    You need to show the runes some level of respect, traditionally a blood offering,
    and form a connection with them in order to fully utilize their potential. Simply
    assuming the symbol alone has limitless power that you can exploit is probably
    the quickest way to upset the spirits and get yourself cursed. In conclusion,
    do not contact this person, do not waste your time with this spell that should
    be an article. If you see a term that interests you, Google it, it will be a better
    use of your time.'
