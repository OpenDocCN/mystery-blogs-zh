If you have a candle, light it and place it on any typw of bedside table. If not, sit in a meditation position on your bed. My advice is to turn off the lights. Then chant this: Mă angajez să întuneric. nu voi mai umbla printre oameni. În cazul în care dintii ar trebui să fie, voi avea colți. În cazul în care o foame pentru produsele alimentare este, voi fi foame pentru sânge. Mi-aș dori să-și verse forma mea umană în spatele și a devenit unul dintre voi, un vampir. Aceasta este voința mea, așa praf sa fie! It means I pledge myself to darkness. No longer will I walk among humans. Where teeth should be, there will be fangs. Where hunger for food should be, I will be hungry for blood. I wish to shed my human form behind and become on of you, a vampire. This is my will, so mote it be! Right after you say the spell, you'll feel light headed. Then you'll pass out. When you wake up, you'll be a vampire. Abilities: Levitation Mind control Bat transformation Telekineses Immortality Invisibility The ability to heal others.
