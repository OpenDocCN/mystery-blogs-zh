- en: A spell that begins to take power instantly after the casting is done. The casting
    is a little complicated but you are still able to do it. There are 9 steps, 1
    step that you must do if you do something wrong (which is simple to perform and
    not mess up), and 1 step to cancel the spell if you change your mind.
