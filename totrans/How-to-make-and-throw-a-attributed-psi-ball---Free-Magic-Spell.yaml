- en: Different visualizations can produce different types of psi balls and different
    effects the psi balls have on other objects. One of my favorite things to do is
    to make a psi ball, visualizing it as a ball of fire While that might result in
    a hot psi ball, visualizing a flame colored blue or a tornado of snow might produce
    a cold one. Have fun with this - these are just a few examples! Combine ideas
    as well.

    do this by, you guessed it, visualization! I would pretend to see my invisible
    psi ball and watch it with my eyes as it flew through the air. I was really just
    tracing a simple curved path in the air with my eyes, but after some practice,
    it did start to work. I would make a hot ball and throw it at a thermometer from
    across the room then watch the degrees rise. Or I would boomerang one around the
    room, and catch it. You'd be surprised how fun it is
