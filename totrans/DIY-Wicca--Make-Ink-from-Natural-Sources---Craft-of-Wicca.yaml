    be a highly rewarding addition to your practice. Magic often involves writing,
    and if you make your own ink, you can infuse it with natural elements to enhance
    the spell.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it. For example,
    you could use a “brush” instead of a “pen,” and then you wouldn’t need to worry
    about binding or thickening. It would be more like a watercolor than an ink, though.

    I can’t give you every recipe ever.

    temperature, humidity, and elevation all affect ink thickness. Your exact writing
    utensil will affect how thick you want it.
  prefs: []

    doing. The time of year you harvest certain plants and botanicals will greatly
    affect how vibrant the colors turn out.

    the easiest step.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '### Pigmentation'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The dye creates the base for the color. You’ll need to gather this from wherever
    you like. It could come from flower petals in your [Wiccan garden](https://craftofwicca.com/the-essential-wiccan-garden-design-supplies-and-more/)
    or wander the woods and look for anything that strikes your fancy.
  prefs: []

    plant.

    about protection.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make the dye start with a 1:1 ratio of the solid to water. I usually do 1
    cup of the plant (or charcoal or whatever) and 1 cup of water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bring this to a boil. If the color isn’t showing after a few minutes, add a
    tiny amount of vinegar and salt to help break it down. This isn’t necessary depending
    on the plant, so it’s good to try without it first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the material, it often helps to mash it while it simmers to help
    release the color.

    times it only takes 10 minutes. Use your judgment.

    wire mesh strainers tend to miss things, and you don’t want chunks in the ink.

    So, let’s go with stuff you can find around the house.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In olden days people used maple syrup or honey, and both of these work great!
    But, I’ll warn you that it makes the ink a bit sticky, so if you’re planning on
    writing something permanent, things can go wrong storing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For writing that happens just for the spell, I wouldn’t try to do anything more
    complicated. For longer-term use, you can use flour or corn starch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two things to remember with these. First, dissolve it in a small amount
    of cold water first or it will clump in the hot dye. Second, the white from these
    substances will change the color of the ink.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you put a small amount of the thickener in, shake it well and let it rest.
    It will thicken as it cools, and you’ll want to check if it’s the right consistency
    for your purposes.

    a few sprigs of a fresh herb into the dyeing stage of the process to make the
    ink aromatic and take on magical properties of the herb.

    use this homemade ink with it unless you’re sure it is fine. Fountain pens require
    a very precise consistency or they will clog.

    once to write a rune on a large stone during a moon ritual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also make a feather pen if you have a way to get a feather. Simply cut
    the end of the feather at an angle. When you dip the end into the ink, it will
    catch in the end, and you can write with it.
  prefs: []

    The easiest DIY “brush” is to just use the end of a Q-tip!

    Don’t go overboard at first. Whatever ingredient you want to use will probably
    have enough in there without needing to add something else.

    feel the need to find “deep” colors in nature if your spell already has any sort
    of plant in it.
