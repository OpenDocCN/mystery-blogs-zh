- en: 1\. First, decide which Archangel you want to summon and look up their sigil
    online.  If you can't find the Archangel's sigil, use Google translate to translate
    the name from English to Hebrew (in case you're worried don't be, Hebrew on Google
    translate is actually very accurate).  Google Images is a good place to look for
    Archangel Sigils.

- en: 2\. Once you have chosen your Angel, draw the sigil (or Hebrew name) on a sheet
    of paper with a pen or pencil (I prefer pencil because you can erase and correct
    mistakes).  Then draw a circle around the sigil, then draw a circle around that
    circle.  In between the circles, write the name of the Archangel in English (or
    your native language) in four areas.  Between the names you can draw little crosses,
    pentagrams, or stars of David if you just want to spice up your Sigils design.

- en: 3\. Find a private place where you won't be distracted by outside influences.
     If you have an altar in your room, you can use some tape to tape the sigil on
    the wall above it.

- en: '4\. After you have found your space and set up the sigil so that you can see
    it and focus on it, cleanse your space so that you only get the spirit you want.
     The cleansing can be done by multiple means such as through prayers, spells,
    and rituals.  Some resources you can use for this from this Coven page are: St.
    Michael''s Prayer, Hallowing Spell, Flames of Purgatory, and others.  But feel
    free to cleanse however you want, just please cleanse your space so demons don''t
    infiltrate your ritual!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '5\. Once your space has been cleansed, light the votive candle (I would suggest
    holding it so that you don''t accidentally knock it over and burn things).  Then
    focus on the sigil in front of you and chant the name of the Archangel in any
    language you want (preferably the one you are best at speaking).  Keep doing this
    until you feel the presence of the Archangel coming into your space.  Once that
    has been done, feel free to talk to the Archangel through prayer.  You can ask
    it for many things: you can ask it to become your spirit guide, you can ask it
    for favors, you can ask it for good fortune, you can ask it for information about
    the Spirit world or more mundane knowledge, etc.'

    or attract their favor to you without actually summoning the Angel.'
