    witchcraft symbols that you might come across during your magickal practice. Symbols
    are something that we’ve touched on before with these posts about [protection
    symbols](https://wiccanow.com/9-protection-symbols/), another one about [Wiccan
    symbols](https://wiccanow.com/all-about-wiccan-symbols/) and also one explaining
    how [sigil magick works](https://wiccanow.com/sigil-magic-learn-about-the-secret-magic-of-symbols/).

    stressing that every practice is individual and there are no rules?) it’s good
    to have some basic knowledge of some of the symbols you might come across in your
    magickal life. Below is my guide to 26 common witchcraft symbols. This guide is
    in no particular order, so don’t think that the first symbol on the list holds
    any more importance than the last!

    Always be aware of the modern meanings of a symbol, because they might not always
    mean what you think they mean. I’ve added a couple of symbols here which are common
    within the witchcraft community yet I would NEVER use them personally.

    of years yet it’s been perverted into a symbol for white supremacy in recent times.
    Even though this is an ancient protection symbol which didn’t always mean white
    pride, these days that’s the main connotation for it so I refuse to use it.

    originally ascribed to them. It’s good to be aware of those meanings before you
    use those particular symbols so you don’t end up in a situation you would rather
    avoid.

    gains from each stage. This maze is also called the “Stropholos of Hecate” or

- en: The pentacle is a powerful protection symbol that is commonly associated with
    Wicca and witchcraft. The pentacle is actually a combination of 2 symbols, namely
    the pentagram (a 5-pointed star) and the circle. The pentacle represents the wholeness
    of the self and the natural world. The 5 points on the pentagram represent the
    4 elements (fire, water, earth and air) and the top point of the star represents
    either the self or the divine spirit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a theory that the pentacle originated in Greece where it was associated
    with the earth Goddess Ceres. Apples were sacred to her and when cut in ½ crossways
    there is a 5 pointed star inside. Due to this, some people call the 5 pointed
    star the “star of wisdom” and associate apples with knowledge and learning.
  prefs: []

    represent the 2 aspects of the Horned God and the 3 top points represent the aspects
    of the Triple Goddess. Enclosing this symbol in a circle represents the infinite
    energy created when all energies are equal i.e. the Divine Spirit.

    courage. The lower left is associated with earth, the colours brown and green

    as it could very well be misconstrued as a political statement rather than a protective
    witchcraft symbol. I tend to stay away from using it because I want absolutely
    nothing to do with something associated with values and ideas that I find absolutely
    abhorrent. It’s really a huge shame that this ancient symbol has been perverted

    and the 8 sabbats associated with it along with the sun. It was a powerful symbol
    because the sun has long been revered as extremely powerful and magickal. The
    Greeks were so cautious when worshipping the Sun Gods that they refused to use
    wine as an offering. They were worried that a deity with so much power might cause
    too much harm if intoxicated so they provided the deities with honey instead.

- en: Some people today consider the hexagram to be a symbol of evil because it has
    6 points and 6 sides and refers to the number 666\. The idea of the devil and
    the association with Wicca and Witchcraft is due to the [Horned Gods](https://wiccanow.com/who-is-a-wiccan-god-your-guide-to-wiccan-deities/#The_Horned_God)
    association with death. Death is a natural part of life and something that everyone
    is going to experience at some point. The Horned God is a guide to aid the transition
    between life and death and doesn’t represent a malicious or evil intent, rather
    another step in a natural process. I don’t believe that this symbol represents
    anything evil or malevolent but others might disagree with me.
