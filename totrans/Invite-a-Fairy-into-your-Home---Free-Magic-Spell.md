*   A thimble of milk

*   Some fairy-sized furniture

*   Potted plants

*   A music box

*   Some honey

*   A small piece of bread

*   Anything else a fairy might like

1\. Set up a small space to place all the ingredients you have chosen. It should be in a tidy and clean room, with low lighting.

2\. Place the items on this space. These items are your offerings to the fairy. He or she might not take it with them physically, but they will appreciate it for sure.

3\. Clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Try to get as calm as possible, before saying ''I welcome you to be my guest, o little fairy''.

4\. Leave the room for a few hours. Fairies are shy, and they might need some time before they are confident enough to interact with you. Don't get disappointed if they don't want to interact at all, they like to have privacy.

5\. When you come back to the room, look for signs that they have been there. Maybe something moved while you where gone, or something might be missing.

Keep doing this for as long as you like. After some time you will have gained the faeries' trust, and they might want to interact with you, or help you in your magical workings. Good luck!

WARNING: None of the items used in this spell should be made from iron, as it can hurt the faeries.

I would work with fairys outside before welcoming them inside. It is like welcoming a fox into your home, sure, you may leave food for it, but once inside it runs around knocking things over because it is confused. I would leave a space outside where you will let the grass grow naturally and you will not enter for them, and if they wish to enter your home on occasion, say when you cleanse your home or cast a circle, say they are welcome. Fairys like their own space, so I can see this backfiring and that room you welcomed them in they now see as their own and you can never enter, less you get cursed by a spiteful fairy.
