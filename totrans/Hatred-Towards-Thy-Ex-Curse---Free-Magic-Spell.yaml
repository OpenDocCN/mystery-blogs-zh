    hate takes over. This is fairly simple, but takes a lot of energy, please be careful.

    or think of your ex (an ex) someone that really makes you mad, now write down
    what you wish to happen to him. Focus your hate on the paper in a dark quiet room,

    fulfilled I will be free from you, I will no longer feel the pain you gave me,
    the hate you caused, and the heart your shattered, this is my gift to you, so

- en: After, make or do something that relaxes you, get your mind off the hate. Let
    yourself restore your energy, and slowly let comfort take over your heart. The
    curse will take some time, even a lot of concentration the first night, if you
    feel if it's stronger to keep doing it for a few days then go ahead. Just know
    there are some side effects, fatigue loss, depression, crying softly, and feeling
    completely lost. Relaxing will make the symptoms go away, even make you feel refreshed
    the next day.
