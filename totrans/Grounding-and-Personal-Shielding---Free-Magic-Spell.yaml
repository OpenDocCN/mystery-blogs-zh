- en: If you are new to shielding begin this ritual at the first visible crescent
    of the waxing moon and repeat every day for one lunar cycle. This will "set" the
    shield firmly in your subconscious mind, which will then maintain the shield automatically.
    Afterwards, repeat the ritual each month at the full moon or whenever you feel
    the need. If desired, this ritual can be performed at solar zenith on the day
    of the first crescent, and on the day of the full moon.

    (do not strain). Anoint your "third eye" and your solar plexus chakra with the
    oil. Breathe deeply and evenly for 9 breaths. Feel yourself become more and more
    relaxed with each breath.'

    of a great willow. Feel your roots extend from the base of your spine deep into
    the Earth to anchor you firmly to the ground.'

    the Earth. Feel it rising up through your spine, filling your entire body like
    sap rising up through a tree. Feel this energy penetrating every cell of your
    body, pulsing with every heartbeat.'

    and sweeping gracefully back down to touch the Earth like a majestic willow, completely
    surrounding, shielding and protecting you. Feel the energy you are drawing up
    from the Earth spray up from the top of your head like a fountain, to flow down
    through your branches and back into the Earth, forming a protective sphere of
    power and energy around you. See yourself comfortably centered within this easily
    flowing, continuously circulating energy sphere.'

    draw the sphere in around your body, concentrating it there like a second skin.
    Continue drawing up energy, layer upon layer like an onion, until it is concentrated
    to a thickness of about 12 inches. KNOW that nothing beneficial or harmful can
    penetrate this shield without your conscious consent.'

    up the shield until it is so bright you cannot "see" through it. At some point
    there will be a "blinding" flash and the shield will become transparent to your
    "sight." The shield is now complete and fully functional. When this happens, say:'
