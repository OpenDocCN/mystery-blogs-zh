# Blood Love Potion w/ Spell

  Rated 5/5 Stars

As something went wrong with my account, I made a new one, anyway here's a great spell I wrote based on blood magick traditions. I guess you can consider this a potion

P.S. Befriend target, as you need to use their drink in this.

## Casting Instructions for 'Blood Love Potion w/ Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Needle/pin (clean and sharp)

*   Plaster (for after making the potion)

*   Dark coloured drink for target

*   Also yes I spell it coloUred, I'm Irish don't blame me.

Use the needle to prick your finger, spill 1-2 drops of blood in to the drink, mix well while saying this spell

''Je crée un véritable amour de moi et toi''
Which is french for
''I create true love between me and you''
Not exactly but it's the easiest translation in terms of basic understanding.

Have target drink the ?potion? Concoction, yeah that's good enough.

Anyway, you can alter the spell so that instead of intense love, it could be temporary, like until the next moon, or once I do ''this'' ritual the love shall end blah blah blah etc.

you're just going to give them a disease dude

That's rude. Do you believe in spells at all?

I shall use it for one week to see what we will be like together.

Blood magick is commonly used, Ive even seen spells that use mensural blood.

What is a plaster and what is it for?

the person who wrote this is probably British as ''plaster'' is their word for ''bandaid''

It literally says their irish. :/

This may be a little late, but this is somewhat concerning as a spell. I do enjoy blood magic, but it is so very important to be as sterile as possible, not just ''cleaned'' but autoclaved. (that's just a general on blood work, even if it is a few drops, if you're going to make any controlled cut, it should be clean as possible). secondly, do not give anyone your body fluids! Even if it is, again, a few drops, it is very unethical and in some places even illegal to have somebody consume your blood (or other things that are produced from your body) without their knowledge. I'd strongly advise against doing this, if anything, think about what would happen if they found out, even myself being a devout wiccan I would feel repulsed if my girl friend did this. The disclaimer at the bottom of the site is a pretty good warning. Do use common sense and don't ingest what doesn't seem safe (or make others ingest)

if you use blood in any type of spell if It's used for a food spell or of the likes I would recommend getting tested for diseases and the works also the safe amount of blood for a human to consume is about a tablespoon. and if u do this spell please use a sterilized needle or knife and clean the wound after. and be careful blessed be every one ^ ^

Do not feed another person blood!!! (If they consent then look up its legal status.)
