This is a high level spell of it doesnt work for you that means you just need more experience with magick

I shall grant wishes as long as they are good

Hey did it work for you? Can you grant me a wish please?

Magick can't give someone the ability to grant any wish, Vampire. However, you could cast spells for some wishes provided they're things that magick can do.

Go on youtube and search up BelieveDreamAchive.dreamer4372 is BelieveDreamAchive.

I am trying this spell. We will see if it works. If not, I will keep trying this spell until it works.

And people stop raining on other people's parade. It's rude and disrespectful.

It's a bit confusing to me that people view pointing out facts about magick as disrespectful. No one is trying to be disrespectful, they're trying to educate someone about magick. If someone said they were going to try and eat deadly nightshade and someone else told them not to because it's poisonous, no one would say that was disrespectful and insist you just had to believe. People are allowed to state facts about things, and it helps beginners learn when people comment that spells are fake.

Is the first day the day after or the day before

This is fake and does not work. You can cast wish spells, but you will not defy nature nor will you be granted the power to make any wish come true.
