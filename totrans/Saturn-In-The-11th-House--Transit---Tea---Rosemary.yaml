    pain, and uses discipline to change the way you view that area of life. Every
    two years or so Saturn will enter a new house and bring with him a variety of
    lessons that you will need in order to move into the next phase of life.'

    Kronos, was the father of time and used his tough parenting skills to bring pain
    and suffering to his children, but ultimately made them better gods and people.

- en: Saturn also represents Karma in astrology, so whatever house Saturn transits
    often means a good deal of Karma coming from that area of life. For that year,
    Saturn will bring pain and learning to that house, and you may learn lessons you
    didn’t even know about in that year.
  prefs: []

- en: Because it takes Saturn so long to return to the same spot (roughly thirty years);
    you will experience lessons and transformations in every area of life until you
    turn 30, and then just repeat for the rest of your life. The great thing about
    Saturn transits is that we are *always learning–* and Saturn will teach the lesson
    whether you want to or not.

- en: In Astrology, the 11th house represents social groups, circles, causes, and
    our place in society. The 11th house is where we become socially active, get involved
    in causes or societal groups. This is also the house of friendships/friend circles,
    especially with more than one person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, the 11th house in astrology represents the *objective truth*.
    It is ruled by Uranus in astrology, and so it can also be a point of rebellion
    or othering yourself. This is a place where we can either try to fit in, or outcast
    ourselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the 11th house, we have the ability to make friends based on common interests
    and community goals. However, there is a tendency to be fake/inauthentic, so those
    tendencies will be revealed during the transit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of Saturn in the 11th house transit is to transform, learn, and change
    the aspects of the 11th house that are not working. To shed ourselves of friendships
    and groups that are not to our highest purpose or are draining our energy, and
    to lead us into better foundations in the 11th house.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most obvious meaning to me about the 11th house refers to “the tribe.” In
    today’s society, it is very difficult to have a tribe, because it often requires
    a lot of choice in the matter. Saturn asks us who our tribe is, gives us options,
    and forces us to make the decision about who we surround ourselves with in a very
    practical and down-to-earth way.

    he does the same thing. A client of mine had a breakup with life-long friends
    due to incompatibility the first week that Saturn entered her 11th house.
  prefs: []

    social circles, family members, clubs, activities– anything that is not authentic.

    often seeks rebellion, Saturn will force us to rebel if it is our true and authentic
    nature. Conforming is not an option.

    have sturdy foundations. Anything that is built on inauthenticity or a lie is
    destroyed, leaving room for only the things that truly serve a purpose.

    we seek to bring into our lives.

    that are unwise for our growth. A lot of times, this will feel like there are
    measures taking place beyond our control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples of this may be people cutting us out of their lives, saying hurtful
    things, or simply leaving us out when Saturn enters the 11th house. It will bring
    up the deepest fears and insecurities about being *liked* and accepted by a group–
    something all humans struggle with. It will also show us how far we are willing
    to go to be liked, and often will stop us from giving ourselves over completely.

- en: While Saturn moves through the 11th House, we may experiment with different
    groups of friends and try to find our place in the world. Some causes will call
    to us, and we will be compelled to see if there is anything there. At other times,
    we will be told or restricted from going in one direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we follow this anyways, ignoring our gut feeling, then Saturn will bring
    pain beyond measure. This is a time to *find your people* and to *find your place*.
    Remember that if you have to force something to work out, that means that Saturn
    is telling you that it is not meant for you, and it is best left behind.
  prefs: []

    are not meant for you. If something comes easily during this time frame, then
    it is likely meant for you and you should see it through. However, be wary of
    Karma in these situations, because Saturn is also the Lord of Karma and may hit
    you when you least expect it.

- en: When Saturn is Transiting the 11th House, most of our Karma will be directed
    at friend groups and circles. This can take the form of not really fitting in,
    or being liked by the wrong people. Saturn tests our ability to be liked, and
    asks us how far we are willing to go to be accepted by society.
  prefs: []

- en: We may make connections during this time that are *doomed to fail*. Because
    the 11th house is not *hidden*, like the 12th house, we may see these things from
    a mile away. When Saturn enters the 11th house, he brings with him 3 Karmic lessons;
    all of which can be easily navigated with intuition.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Saturn usually gives us three trials: the first will be obvious in the form
    of “these people are clearly not for me, why am I trying so hard to be liked?”
    The second comes a bit less clearly, and will *seem* as though these could be
    your people, this could be your group, but under the surface they are still not
    for you. The third will disguise itself entirely, and force you to rely on your
    intuition.'

    tests out over the two years that he remains there, and asks you to choose your
    people and your course of action wisely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many times, Saturn will bring people into your life *as a test*. These are not
    people who are meant to stay in your life, or people who are meant for you, but
    passing the test means advancing, and failing the test means pain. Being able
    to point out who these people are, and learning from the experience either way
    will bring you closer to your ultimate goal– which is all that Saturn really wants
    for you.
