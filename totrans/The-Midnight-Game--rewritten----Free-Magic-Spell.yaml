    pagan ritual'' (shocking), and it looks like it's actually a creepypasta lol.
    You can believe in the spirit mentioned here, and I suppose it's possible that
    this could be dangerous, but it's not actually some ancient ritual.

- en: its creepy pasta but heres what i got from my resources The ''Midnight Game''
    is an old Pagan ritual, used mainly as punishment for those who have broken the
    laws of the Pagan religion in question. While it was mainly used as a scare tactic
    to not disobey the gods, there is still a very existent chance of death to those
    who play the Midnight Game. i have done it i wouldnt recomend it i was once into
    creepy pasta i still dont recomend it it was fun but weaird stuff happened after.
