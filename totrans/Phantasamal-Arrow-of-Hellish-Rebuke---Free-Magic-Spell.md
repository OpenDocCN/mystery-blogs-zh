# Phantasamal Arrow of Hellish Rebuke

This is an advanced psychic construct, it's going to require real destain and anger with someone otherwise the matter of the arrow can't be expected to be to potent.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Phantasamal Arrow of Hellish Rebuke'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Plant yourself breath in the atmosphere as to not let your anger radiate outwards aimlessly as it would have. Take it back into yourself and feel it build up within your being. Now breathe out imagine your whole body breathing it out of every pore allowing you to release all of that tension

It gusts around your whole body then cycling back closer and closer wrapping around your shoulder twisting about your arm ultimately swirling into a violent twisting mass in your hands a ball of blackness radiating a burning red from its center

Recite the words:

"This is bad luck
Soon to be yours
For it was you who plucked my cords
Now watch as I pluck mine
And loose this arrow
The last laugh shall not be thine"

Lastly envision the ball spin at a contorting speed: Causing it to elongate into a needle like form before it ricochets outwards in their direction.

I would not say this is a psychic power, but it is a type of energy working. It is a misfortune hex. You can cast spells by simply focusing your emotions and energy and releasing it. These are not as powerful or as potent as spells with items, but they still work.
