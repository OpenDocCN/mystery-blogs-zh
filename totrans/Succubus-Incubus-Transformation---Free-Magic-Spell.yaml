    melt into them, and grow that area of their body by a considerable amount. The
    outfit will shrink and expand as needed. Your friend will have become a succubus/incubus
    about 5 minutes after this process is completed, and they will stop glowing. Recommended
    outfit for succubus: Maid.'

- en: I dont think its about physically changing them into a succubus or incubus,
    in my experience something like this is dangerous because you are inviting an
    entity to inhabit a persons body which Rhododendron is possible. I think this
    post should be edited or deleted honestly as it wont give the desired effect of
    altering their body but does open them up to being inhabited by an entity, likely
    not even the desired one but rather any one that is nearby and has a desire to
    do so.

- en: You cannot physically transform into a succubus. Also, it is rather cruel to
    transform your friend into a servant, as the description suggests. You might wish
    to do some self reflection and check your moral compass if you genuinely desire
    to make them subservient to you.
