- en: Sometimes when a person dies, their spirit gets stuck in this plane for some
    reason.  They may sincerely want to leave for the afterlife, but fears, doubts
    and regrets weigh on them and keep them from entering into the other world.  Following
    is an incantation which will loosen their ties to this world and open their way
    to the afterlife.  This will only work if the spirit really wants to leave, and
    is not to be used to banish evil spirits.

    guide you beyond this impasse, Traverse in peace on the other side of the veil,
    My blessings, So mote it be. You don’t need to be a practising witch to use this
    incantation – anyone who has some sort of relationship with the spirit can recite
    it. Many times, spirits don’t actually need help passing through the other side
    – sometimes they are just waiting to send a message to their loved ones or to
    make peace with their family. Other times, they just need some time to accept
    their death, and to ensure that their family and loved ones will be able to overcome
    their grief.  Once these things have happened, most spirits will be drawn to the
    light above, without needing the help of any magick.

- en: correct, sometimes shamman see spirit stuck & visioned bad way, thin pale, hungry,
    rugged cloth, unkempt, and in bad case ''Hungry Ghost''. they maybe have something
    still to do & just cannot let go all their desires in earth. There's also person
    who sells his/her soul, after dead the soul is carried by buyer as slave ,but
    other hand there is children who selled by his/her parent as sacrifice for bad
    entities. also suicidal spirit who force to dead. As far i know, not like christian,
    they still wandering around after died for many days. this thing we need to Pray,
    Recite, Offer to gods/goddess to have pity, even ritual magic give food .Public
    problem that people just leave/blind to spirit, yet spirit stuck is actually very
    sorrow.
