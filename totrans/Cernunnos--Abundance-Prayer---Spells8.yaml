- en: The Celtic Forest God, *Cernunnos*, gets his name from a Latin word which means
    “the horned one”. His original name was lost but the name Cernunnos was inscribed
    in the *[Pilier des Nautes](https://spells8.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pilier-des-Nautes.jpg)*,
    a Gaelic-Roman monument found under the Notre Dame cathedral, in Paris, France
    in 1711\.

- en: As a Horned God, he can take the place of consort of the Goddess in the [Wiccan
    Pantheon (God and Goddess)](https://spells8.com/topic/god-and-goddess/). And as
    a primordial deity in Neopagan traditions, his male principality makes him often
    be merged with other gods such as [Pan](https://spells8.com/pan-devotional/) and
    the [Green Man](https://spells8.com/printable-beltane-gifts/).

    is essentially earthly. He is usually depicted with the ears and horns of a deer
    and wearing a “torque”, the sacred neck ornament of Celtic gods and heroes.
