- en: First to start off, light the candle. Kinda blow light enough on the flame where
    smoke rises to the celieng. And if you have a shandaleer, donnot make smoke rise.
    Now you put a little part of your skin (peeled or dead) on the flame tip ( Always
    remeber, its just pain. The flame dosn't kill you, the smoke kills you for suffication,
    there is NO death by flames or pyronics)

- en: Make sure you get some little heat in your hand, enough to have freshening hot
    energy rushing on your tip. Now feel the energy spreading, feel the source of
    it taking your skin and being replaced with Flame Energy. Try to munipultate it.
    Feel the energy taking apart of everything inside-out of your body. Imagine it
    burning away your color, textures, and idenity.

- en: not working, but 'Do any invisibility spells work?'+well if you says become
    not noticed, maybe there is some which working (but if you wanna open shop or
    make friendship,+this type of spell ussualy will make people turn around from
    you, not thinking about you and dont wanna interact with you) +Maybe i ever know
    a very tribal shammanistic things that shamman is already elder for 60 years in
    magic so old, is able to working with forest spirit to make some of his soldier
    almost invisible to human eye and able to flying their some kind of dagger sword.
    when colonialism from voc, and other colonials from europe comes to war with the
    tribals in forest, +but the 'ritual is very long', 'with many tribal participants'
    and 'taking several days' before war occured. which not like something you can
    find here.

- en: Invisibility spells aren't physically turning invisible. They hide your energy,
    or the energy of an object, so people overlook you/the item. If you wish to wander
    around undetected, you might consider astral projection [but even that's no guarantee
    since those who sense spirits can sense astral beings too]
