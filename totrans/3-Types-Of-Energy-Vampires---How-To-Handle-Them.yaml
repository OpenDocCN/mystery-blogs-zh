- en: The word “vampire” continues to be scary across cultures. The word vampire means
    someone who is dangerous and alluring, all at the same time. In the spiritual
    community, energy vampires are thought to be just as dangerous or bad as other
    vampires.

    every myth and legend has a root in reality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    entirely, but for every legend and fairytale, there is typically a real-life origin.
    I have found this to be true whether we’re talking about [fairies](https://teaandrosemary.com/fae-folk-fair-folk-faeries-fairies/),
    [ghosts](https://teaandrosemary.com/types-of-ghost-spirits-entities/), or even

    energy from you. *'

    types of energy vampires who possess different strengths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An energy vampire can be on the physical plane or in the spiritual realm. This
    means that your friend or neighbor can be an energy vampire, but you can also
    have entities that attach to your energy field and act as energy vampires over
    time. Astral energy vampires are much more common than we realize.
  prefs: []

    intentionally to gain power. Others do it unconsciously or subconsciously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but about 50% of entities *do* realize what they’re doing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    stunted or damaged energy system. They can’t generate enough energy themselves,
    so they must source external energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This doesn’t mean that every energy vampire is “evil.” In fact, some people
    drain the energy of others without even realizing it. They might have been born
    with a damaged energy system or they sustained trauma to their energy system during
    this life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other energy vampires have entities attached to them draining their energy,
    so they unconsciously drain the energy of those around them to try and replace
    their own power. It’s a negative cycle that is hard to break out of.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    They don’t have the right body chemistry to sustain energy levels over time, so
    they must take energy from other people.
  prefs: []

    you greet someone and give them a huge, there is a brief exchange of energy.
  prefs: []

    other’s energy. Sometimes, you can exchange energy with another person if you’re

    vampires?

    I don’t classify someone as an energy vampire unless the exchange is way out of
    balance.

    possible to be toxic, narcissistic, sociopathic, etc. without actually draining
    the energy of other people. This is a really specific classification. I’ll go
    over how to tell the difference later in this blog post.

    for just a short period of time (such as after a breakup when energy levels are

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to some degree, so they need to steal energy from others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some human energy vampires steal energy just from being around you without actually
    doing anything. However, it’s more common for human energy vampires to take energy
    through words or actions. This is an easier way for energy vampires to gain energy.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**1\. Praise**. These types of energy vampires will praise people to either
    get what they want or to make the other person feel indebted to them. This praise
    is *not *genuine and is accompanied by a vague, ugly feeling.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**2\. Intimidation.** Many energy vampires gain energy through intimidation.
    They put someone else down, even very subtly, and gain energy through the exchange.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**3\. Guilt.** This can be subtle or covert. These types of energy vampires
    will make someone else feel guilty and draw on their energy. They are effectively
    getting the person to lower their shield so that they can “steal” their source.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**4\. Focus On Self.** If you’ve ever been sucked in by someone talking about
    themselves incessantly or complaining about their problems, then you know what
    this type of energy vampire sounds like. As you listen, they are actively sucking
    your energy out of your field.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**5\. Touch.** Although we all exchange energy when we touch, an energy vampire
    will take a *lot* of energy through physical interactions. In fact, you may feel
    depleted after you hug or even brush against this person.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some types of energy vampires do these things in the short term only. For example,
    if a friend breaks up with her boyfriend, her energy system may go off, forcing
    her to steal from other people. She might complain quite a bit and want more touch
    than usual. She probably doesn’t even realize she’s doing this, but she will naturally
    “right” her energy system over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other energy vampires steal energy over the long-term. These are the relationships
    that tend to feel one-sided.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a mutual give and take in a relationship with someone then it is
    almost guaranteed that they aren’t an energy vampire. One-sided relationships
    will drain you and are more likely to be relationships with an energy vampire
    in them.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is relatively broad, but it generally refers to a negative spiritual being that
    hangs out in your energetic field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although not *all* entities are energy vampires, *most* of the entities who
    attach to you will steal energy in some way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Initially, the entity energy vampire will attach to you because of the *state
    of being* that you’re in. This means that you weren’t warded and had an emotionally
    “low” moment. Your vibration was low enough that the entity could successful attach
    to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From thereon, the entity hangs out in your energy field and drains you. The
    longer the entity is attached to you, the stronger it becomes. For this reason,
    it’s ideal to get rid of entities right away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    You may also have negative dreams or nightmares. Some people even feel different
    emotionally or start wanting things that are out of character for them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    energy vampires and drain a lot of energy out of you. Just like other types of
    energy vampires, there is a broad spectrum with entities.

    physically ill. However, this is rare.

    parasites. Just like we need to cleanse our bodies every so often, we must do
    the same for spiritual attachments.

    spiritual community, but I have personally encountered this type of energy vampire,
    so I wanted to include the categorization.

    manifested by your own thoughts or actions.
  prefs: []

    in your energy field and sucks energy out of you, leaving you drained and tired.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the stronger it gets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, people in abusive relationships often have energy vortexes attached
    to them. When they ignore the abusive actions of their partner and stay in the
    relationship, the energy vortex gets stronger and drains more of their energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that created it in the first place.
  prefs: []

    the vortex using the pendulum or by doing a simple meditation. In the long term,
    it’s much more effective to get to the root of the problem, or you may have to
    clear the vortex over and over.

    vampire. If you have a migraine for three days in a row, but only see someone

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    symptoms may be more consistent because they’re always in your energy field.
  prefs: []

    freely giving your energy away then they don’t really count as a true energy vampire.
  prefs: []

    energy vampire.
  prefs: []

    you become. This is a good thing because it means you’re getting stronger, but
    it also means that your energy will be drained more quickly around other people.
    Instead of assuming you were near an energy vampire, learn how to protect your *own*
    energy so that you don’t give it away.

    2-3 of these symptoms multiple times in a row. Alternatively, I sometimes feel
