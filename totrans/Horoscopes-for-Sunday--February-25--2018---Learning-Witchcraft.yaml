    so affairs of the heart will be of major importance over the coming 12 months.
    If love really does make the world go around it won’t only be your head that’s
    spinning.

    people may tell you that it’s immoral to cash in on your “privilege” but don’t
    take any notice of them – you have a talent and it’s right and proper that you
    make use of it.

    – so take the hint. The only way you are going to resolve a dilemma that has been
    giving you sleepless nights is to approach it from a completely different angle.

- en: The facts of a particular situation may seem obvious but you would still be
    wise to check up on them. Cosmic activity in the most deceptive area of your chart
    suggests the facts may not be facts at all – in fact some are sheer fantasy.

    calls your bluff this week your reputation could quickly head south as others
    realize you are all talk and no action. Sometimes it’s best to say nothing at
    all.

    days and if you act quickly and decisively rewards and recognition are sure to
    follow.

    may not have cared about in the past. You will also be able to see links that
    you had missed before. Look for connections and you will surely find them.

    to you. Try to get past the details of whatever situation you find yourself in
    and steal a glimpse of the bigger picture. It’s a picture that might just change
    your life.

    okay – in fact it’s good. Too many people have been avoiding the truth of late
    and it’s time they were reminded of the facts of the situation. Speak up loud
    and clear.

    could even cost you money but if you go back on what you said it will cost you
    much more in the long-term. Your reputation is priceless – don’t put it at risk.

    if you fail to take it seriously. No matter how insignificant the facts of a situation
    may appear to be you must act on the assumption that it’s a matter of life and
    death.
