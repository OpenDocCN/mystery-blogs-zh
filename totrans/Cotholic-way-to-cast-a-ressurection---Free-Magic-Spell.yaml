- en: Why must it about heaven? through in many ancient pantheon, there always gods/goddess
    of the underworld. and 'clouds of heaven'? if you mean above.. in outer space
    there is no clouds. Also 'in your heart' , you want a pet inside your microcosmos?.
    Also too 'your left chest'? why it is not right chest? well, energy and spirit
    could be everywhere, and not attached on left chest only. Maybe in once a year,
    gates is open, thats why we see ''hungry Ghost festival'', ''Yulanpen Sutra''
    in asian or ''Halloween'' in.. , these gates is allowed (by gods) to be open between
    the dead and alive but just for a while, to not disturb the balance.
