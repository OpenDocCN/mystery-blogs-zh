**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 white candle

*   1 pinch of salt

 Sit down in the middle of the room and light the candle. For a few minutes, just breathe deeply and clear your mind. Then imagine that the candle's flame is giving off a bright glow that floods the entire room. Imagine that this candle is giving off lots of positive energy. It is filling the room with its warm, positive glow. Open your eyes and say the following chant 3 times:

"Let the candle's glow fill the room with a positive glow, let this very room be filled with warm, positive energy, by the time this candle burns out, there will be no negativity left, so mote it be."

Sprinkle a VERY tiny amount of salt in each corner of the room. When the candle burns out on its own, you can vacuum up the salt. Make sure you let the candle burn out by it self so the room has time to absorb all of the candle's energy.
