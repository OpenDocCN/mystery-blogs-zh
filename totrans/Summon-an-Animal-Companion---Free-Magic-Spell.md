 ## Casting Instructions for 'Summon an Animal Companion'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Key or some object that has meaning to you

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   2 pieces of paper

*   Pencil

*   Key or some object that has meaning to you

 Draw your chosen animal in pencil on the first sheet of paper. Be detailed, make it look like it could be real. But the animal doesn't actually HAVE to be real. So you could draw a dragon, Phoenix, or really anything. But just make it look kind of real. Not perfect, but make it look good.

Now, on the second paper, write your animal's:

*   Name
*   Gender
*   Eye Color
*   Element
*   Species
*   Powers
*   Personality

Now write the following:

"I call upon my newborn companion (animal's species), ( animal's name). He/She will stay be my side for the rest of my days. Bound to me by this (key/object that you chose). This is my will, so mote it be!" Then say this aloud

Then fold the paper in half twice, write the animals name and species in capital letters. Fold it in half again and write it's elements in capitals. Then chant, "I call my companion (animal's name) to stay by my side for the rest of my days, so mote it be!"

Now, for the rest of the day, you have to take the paper with you wherever you go. Until you get your animal, you need to keep your key or chosen object with you

I continue to chant and Im eagerly waiting for my little companion bat to come to me!

how do we know that it works... have you done it yourself?

Honestly, just try it. If it works, yay! If it doesn't, no harm done.
