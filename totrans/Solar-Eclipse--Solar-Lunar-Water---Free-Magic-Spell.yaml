- en: First, you will have wanted to have already located a bottle, jar, vase, bowl
    etc. Remember, if you won't have the chance to experience another Solar Eclipse
    you may want to have a bigger container!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fill your chosen container with running water. When it is full, bless it by
    putting in a pinch of salt and hold the container in your hands and visualize
    it being able to soak in the energy from the sun and the dark moon crossing over
    it. Cover the container with the cloth when you are done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, you will want to set up your sacred space outdoors. You can do this by
    arranging crystals, candles, and flowers around the container in whatever arrangement
    suits you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the eclipse is nearing the start, light your candles if any, and uncover
    the container of water carefully. Let the water sit out and charge during the
    entire duration of the eclipse. When the eclipse is over, you should have a jar
    of lunar, and solar charged water!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because this water is charged with both the power from the sun and moon, it
    should result in a more powerful type of moonwater, as well as be a balance of
    Masculine and Feminine energies. This water is now yours to do as you please with
    it. You might drink it for your own strength or use it to bless or purify other
    items.
