- en: Different myth give them different name. I collected it from Indian local islamic
    tantra. So result may vary,it depends on your initiation from your master. If
    your master is islamic shabar tantra expert, you can get sollution.

- en: As far as I am aware, there is no such thing as a Minnu Fairy. You also should
    not call on a fairy, offer it cloth and flowers and expect it to Grant you good
    luck. Cut flowers are seen as insulting as you killed something natural. As for
    cloth, it falls into the clothes and tools category which is a way to tell a fairy
    to leave your space and is seen as offensive. Just bake a fairy cake and set it
    outside.

- en: An offering for The Fae. It can simply be a vanilla cake recipe with a few extra
    things The Fae enjoy. I make mine with oats and elderberry. Never make it with
    chocolate. Make the cakes, take the perfect ones, as any imperfections can be
    seen as an insult, and place them outside. Do not make a sweeping declaration
    when you do it. I normally go to the same space with a plate of them, I place
    them on a rock, take one, and walk away. It is perceived more like sharing and
    less like an offering.

- en: Tadashi, why can't it be chocolate? Is there anything that makes it seem bad
    to Fae?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fae seem to dislike anything that could do harm to the wildlife who they live
    among. If you are leaving an offering outside, do not put something out that an
    animal could eat and get sick. It will upset The Fae, because they will see it
    as deliberate and not accidental. If you have an altar inside, you could try giving
    chocolate, but I would go with milk chocolate or white chocolate over dark chocolate
    because of how sweet the chocolate is.
