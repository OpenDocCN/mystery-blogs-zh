Put the rosemary and rose quartz in the box. Put anything else that represents love to youin the box (drawings of hearts, poems, or whatever be creative).

Remember, this spell is to attract love to you,not a specific lover so dont use are presentation of a particular person. Be in a very positive state of mind. Imagine yourself very happy and in love. Light the candle and say:

"I am love
love I will find
true love preferably
will soon be mine

Love is me
Love I seek
my true love
I will soon meet"

Now sit for a little while and concentrate again on being happy. Pinch out the candle and add it to the box. Let the incense burn out. Seal the box shut and dont open it until you have found your true love.

When you have found your lover, take the rose quartz out of the box and keep it as a reminder. Bury the entire box in the earth.

Because in this spell you reproduce a positive state of mind and you are imagining what it is like to be in love, you set up a current of energy which attracts like feeling. In sealing the box you are capturing the vibration of love and all things then become possible.
