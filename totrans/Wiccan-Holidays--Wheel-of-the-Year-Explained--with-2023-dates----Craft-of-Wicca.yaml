  prefs: []

- en: The Wiccan holiday calendar traditionally begins with Samhain. In modern times,
    we call this Halloween or the Day of the Dead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The four greater sabbats are the ones that fall exactly between the solstices
    and equinoxes. It may seem odd to mark the “cross-quarter days” as more fundamental
    (and greater) than the “quarter days” coming from the sun itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But life in ancient times was based on the seasons, and the Four Greater Sabbats
    mark the seasons. It makes sense that Samhain would be considered most important
    because it aligns with the shortening of the day and the descent of the sun.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sun is vital to survival, and early Samhain traditions had a lot to do with
    fire and burning in a call to the sun. It marks the start of the dark part of
    the year.

    translates to “gathering.”

    of winter are mostly behind us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    importance of this day has made its way to other traditions in the form of Candlemas
    of Catholicism and Groundhog’s Day in modern secular times.
  prefs: []

    of the sun’s return. The feast comes from Saint Brigid, the Goddess of Fertility.

    open up the house after the dark hibernation of winter. This is where the notion
    of Spring cleaning comes from.

    this is why Christians adopted Easter to be around this time (to be in sync with
    Pagan “rebirth” rites).

    you keep one flame to light all other flames for the year. This flame is extinguished

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are the four Wiccan holidays that are determined by the solar cycle. While
    these might seem more fundamental than the Greater Sabbats, they were less essential
    to living than the Greater Sabbats.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    planting, harvesting, and herd rotations. Without food, there would be no life.

    days as well. The sun’s position is impossible for any human to change.
