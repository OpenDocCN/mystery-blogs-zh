    subject is so extensive that it would take months, no, years to do even a miner
    justice to it.

- en: Wood has been used for millennia in magic, ceremony, perfumes, and incenses,
    tools, that‚Äôs just to name a few. Then you have to look at how essential it has
    been in activities of daily living. I‚Äôm talking about tools to make our lives
    easier, plows, carpentry, utensils and buildings for stock and humans. As man
    evolved, wood was often a life saver, think fire for warmth, light to ward off
    wild animals. These trees and their magical uses are a very small list of woods,
    there were/are too many uses to actually acknowledge in this paper.
