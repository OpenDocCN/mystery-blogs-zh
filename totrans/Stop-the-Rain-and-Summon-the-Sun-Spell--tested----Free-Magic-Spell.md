Hi, guys! Follow the steps to stop rain and bring out the sun!

Here's the one and only step!
Chant once:
''Gods and Goddesses of the weather,
please stop this dreadful rain,
make the sun come shine again.
Slow down this water,
make it hotter,
This is my will SO MOTE IT BE!''

You can whisper or say out loud, I don't know if it works if you say it in your mind, though.
I believe it's more powerful if you perform with a magick caster, and/or outside. It works just fine without them, though.
I like to thank the Gods and Goddesses after I chant the spell.

Mail me if it works for you! I hope I helped, and have a magical day!
~Magick

It is rather presumptuous to assume you know better than nature.
