# 5 Signs You're Clairaudient + How To Develop Clairaudience Further

Psychism is so exciting, but it can feel pretty elusive. I truly believe that everyone is psychic and can develop different types of supernatural gifts. I often get asked: what are steps you can actually take to do this?

Firstly, I think it’s helpful to know what psychic senses you possess naturally, because the strongest is often the easiest sense to develop *first.*

**The main psychic senses are:**

*   Clairvoyance: seeing
*   Clairaudience: hearing
*   Clairsentience: feeling
*   Clairalience: smelling
*   Clairgustance: tasting
*   Claircognizance: knowing

Today I’ll be discussing clairaudience. This is a semi-common psychic sense that is often overlooked. When you hear something odd in your ears, you don’t typically assume it’s a ghost (like we do with sight) and probably just brush it off.

To determine if you have clairaudient abilities, you’ll need to dig deep. Read through these signs and then try to pay attention over the next few days to see if any of these things happen to you during your normal life.

**Here are 5 easy signs that you have strong natural clairaudience, which is psychic hearing**. Keep in mind that even if these signs don’t fit you it is possible to develop any of the senses, it will just take more time.

## 5\. You Sometimes Hear A High Pitched Ringing Noise In Your Ears

Have you ever heard a sudden high pitched noise that didn’t have an origin? The first few times this happened to me, I was sure it was construction outside, but it turns out that this is actually your spirit guides speaking to you.

Guides speak at a much higher frequency so it can be hard for humans to tune in and accurately depict individual words. Hearing this high pitched noise means that you’re slightly tuned into the frequency and just need to refine your hearing!

## 4\. You Tend To Hear First When Doing a Past Life Regression Or Meditating

When you’re in a deep hypnosis or trance for the purpose of doing a past life regression or meditation, what sense becomes clear first?

For example, if you’re supposed to be on a beach during your meditation, do you see the water and sand first or do you hear the sounds of the ocean and wind? If hearing is the first (or even one of the first) senses then this is a good indicator of clairaudience.

## 3\. You’ve Heard Other Voices In Your Mind

I don’t mean this in a way that could signal mental illness *at all*. If you’re hearing voices in your head that are telling you false information, instructing you to perform harmful actions, etc. then that is definitely not clairaudience and would be better dealt with by your doctor. If however, you sometimes hear a sentence from a voice other than your own that gives you guidance, this can be a sign of clairaudience.

For example, you may be considering an issue when you suddenly hear a voice give you insight. I usually hear this in my mind (not with my physical ears) but it sounds very different from my own internal voice.

## 2\. You Talk To Yourself In Full Sentences

Are you ever in the car or the shower and you just have to say a full sentence out loud? This is often because you have so many words in your head that you need to put the words out there.

Even though this doesn’t feel like something that is *psychic* per se, this can be a sign of a busy mind due to the amount of information that you’re receiving from the universe. It’s also a sign that you’re working on organizing your thoughts which can help you to become a more coherent clairaudient.

## 1\. Thoughts Pop Into Your Mind With No Clear Origin

Are you ever going about your daily life and have a sudden thought that you *know *didn’t come from your own head? I find that these thoughts are often ideas I couldn’t dream up if I tried, so I know that they’re from spirit.

These thoughts are a sign that you do have some level of natural clairaudience, but as you work to develop it, you will start to have more and more guidance throughout the day and may even be able to ask for it directly.
