# Awesome Flying/Levitation

This spell worked twice for me but you have to believe in order to levitate or fly. (a lot of belief is needed)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Awesome Flying/Levitation'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Dandelions

*   A fairy friend that can give you fairy dust

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Dandelions

*   A fairy friend that can give you fairy dust

 Set the dandelions out in a circle and stand in it. Next, chant this, " fly me to the stars, fly me to the moon, I shall float up there, but bring me down when I say, ( )".

Fairies themselves are real, you know. They don't live in this world and I don't care about what other people say, I do have a fairy friend and say I'm delirious but i am not. They can't be photographed and the king has banished them from coming into human contact as unfortunately an incident happened many moons ago. Leave these creators alone, thank you.

No amount of belief will change reality, you can not fly.

oh boy here come the 9 year olds

im sorry but yeas its called astral projection

Astral Projection is real, however, this spell claims you can physically fly, which you simply can not do unless you get in a plane or other flying invention.

Excessive use of capitals and roleplaying is against site rules, please refrain from this in future or your account could be gagged.

I would only state things I am absolutely sure of such as this, you cannot fly with Magic. You probably watched a stage magician use an illusion to trick the observer into seeing levitation/flight when in reality they did not. That is how stage magic works, it is called misdirection. You cannot physically fly. If it was possible in any way, I would have said so, but it is not, hence why I said it with 100% conviction it is not possible. If you saw someone fly, I suggest getting your eyes checked, Magic is an energy, it gives the energy around us a specific charge to bring a desired change into our lives. It works with nature. It does not change the physical in such an unnatural way.

Fairies are real and I dont care what people say because I do have a fairy friend called Miranda and the king has banished them from coming into human contact so we send letters to each other. No hate against fairies because you non-believers are killing them, thank you.

This has absolutely nothing to do with the Fae. This is a spell claiming you can fly by holding a dandelion and saying you want to fly. I have worked with the Fae for most of my life, many of them live around my home, nobody is denying the existences of fairys and other nature spirits of their kind. They are not physical beings, nor can you become one, but you certainly can work with them.

Fairy dust ain't real, You CAN'T fly or something like this.
