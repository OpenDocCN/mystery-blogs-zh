- en: '@ThatUnicorn magick is an natural energy, it is ruled by nature and doesn''t
    contradict nature. You are human, humans cannot physically transform naturally,
    therefore a spell will not grant you this ability. There is a belief in some native
    tribes that a powerful shaman can gain this abilities through decades of study,
    practice, and guidance from another who has mastered this art, but not only is
    this seen as an extremely rare and spiritually draining task, only elders are
    granted this wisdom. I''m not about to discredit these spiritual beliefs, but
    I will say any spell you find on this are claiming it''ll happen is completely
    fake.'

    Its science and a lot of people shifting use subliminals as well which definitely
    bring results. Maybe spells won''t bring change, but subliminals and shifting
    will.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's nothing wrong with using subliminals for scientifically possible things,
    but they certainly won't make you shift. Also, there's actually a lot of skepticism
    surrounding subliminals due to the fact that there's no proof they work, and most
    scientific and unbiased reports I've seen suggest the results people claim to
    see are likely placebo. All in all, nothing wrong with using them (for things
    that are actually possible, not shifting) but to claim that they definitely work
    is simply false, as scientific studies have not proven subliminals to be effective
    and there's still debate around it. Also, spells do work with science. In fact,
    that's exactly why shifting spells are fake. What's scientifically possible is
    the limit of magick, as magick is a natural force and doesn't work against the
    laws of nature.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    fiance does, I don't] and while chaos magick can be more unpredictable and not
    as linear as other forms, it's still the same magickal energy found in nature
    you're calling on.

    and my pendulum also says it worked. Plus, there''s always the shifting method
    which truly works. As far as I know with becoming mythical, shifting is the main
    method, spells build up energy for the physical and phantom shift, idk for subliminals
    but subliminals definitely do help. Biokinesis also helps but it isn''t as common.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your friend is anecdotal evidence, and I'm talking about scientific evidence.
    You brought up science so I mentioned the fact that according to research, there
    is no evidence that subliminals work, nor is shifting scientific by any means.
    Pendulums are incredibly susceptible to personal bias so that provides no real
    proof either. At the end of the day you can believe what you believe, but factually
    speaking shifting is considered impossible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: none of what you said could be considered ''evidence'' of your point. while
    i've done pendulum work and have friends who are great with them, it's easily
    manipulated [plus if you're just using it, it's communicating with your subconscious,
    so saying your pendulum told you it's real, when you already believe it's real,
    is your own bias, not facts] as for ''subliminal'' change, i won't argue a spiritual,
    mental, or astral transformation, my point is when it comes to phyiscal shape
    shifting, it is a fact proven time and time again it does not work. saying your
    friend was meditating and transformed into an animal, was in the astral and transformed
    into a werewolf, or were any other altered stated and transformed in any non physical
    way doesn't prove physical shapeshifting is possible. physically it is not. all
    others fall into the plausible and belief section of the debate and is a different
    matter.
