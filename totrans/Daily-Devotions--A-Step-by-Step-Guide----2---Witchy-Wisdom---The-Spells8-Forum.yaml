- en: Daily devotions are a big part of my spiritual and religious practice. The Goddess
    I worship requires it of me, so I naturally comply. It was a strange thing for
    me to get used to doing, honestly, because it wasn’t something I had ever done
    before. Granted, I had been a Wiccan for more than ten years, but the Lord and
    Lady had never called upon me to do daily devotions. So, I’m here to help you
    do yours.

    you want. This can be spirits of the Land, deities, the Earth - the list can go
    on and on. You have to figure this out first before you can move on to step two
    or step two won’t make much sense.

- en: When doing a devotion, it is always respectful and encouraged to have some form
    of offering. This is going to depend largely on who you are making the devotion
    too, so that is a personal choice. The offerings I use daily are either incense
    or candles, depending on what I feel called to do that day. You will want to use
    something that has a connection to who you are doing the devotion for, so make
    sure that you do your research here or use your [personal gnosis](https://hellenicfaith.com/personal-gnosis/).

- en: Sometimes this isn’t always possible, but I find it best to do my daily devotion
    in the morning before the sun rises - which is significant - and before my daughter
    wakes up. This ensures that I have a quiet space to reflect and speak to my Goddess
    while doing my daily devotion. You might want to light candles and incense to
    set the mood for the devotional. You might want to play some music. You might
    want to cleanse the space daily. Whatever your entity requires, make sure that
    it is something safe for you to do. Remember to always practice fire safety when
    using candles, too.

- en: This is the easiest and the hardest. When I first started doing daily devotions,
    I would say them in my head. I knew She was still receiving my offering and prayer,
    but I felt awkward and strange saying anything out loud. Now, I’ve grown more
    comfortable and, when in my space, it is even conversational before getting more
    serious. If you don’t know what to say, that’s okay. You can have a look at the
    [Devotions](https://spells8.com/magic/pagan-devotionals/) page here at Spells8,
    or you can say your own. Make it personal and speak from the heart.

    you’ll be on your way to developing a beautiful habit of daily devotions. Make
    sure you keep your devotion space clean and cleansed, as well. When doing devotions,
    we are entering a liminal space - a between place where we are neither here, nor
    there. We need to keep that space free of clutter and mess because that can affect
    our mental state, and I’m sure the entities you are saying a devotion for would
    appreciate a clean space to come to as well.
