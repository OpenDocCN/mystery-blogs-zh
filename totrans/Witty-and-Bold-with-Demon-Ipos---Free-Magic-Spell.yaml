- en: '**Encounter with Ipos**: Sinking deeper into the abyss, visualize a magnificent
    fortress of shadow and flame. Herein dwells Ipos. As you approach, the spirit
    manifests — neither entirely beast nor human, but an amalgamation of forms that
    signify cunning and confidence. The creature, enveloped in an aura of vibrant
    energy, stands before you. Reach out and allow it to merge with you, feeling every
    facet of its essence — the audacity, the wit, the strength — intertwining with
    your spirit. This can be a pleasurable and intense process, allow it to unfold
    for as long as it takes.'

    As you sip the water (or wine), perceive it as a final act of merging, a ritualistic
    affirmation of the transformation you’ve undergone. The liquid is a pact, the
    bond that ensures Ipos’s essence is now a part of you.'
