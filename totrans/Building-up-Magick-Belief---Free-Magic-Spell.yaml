- en: 'Step 1: Find some time alone,where you have some peace and quiet. Find a place
    that you will be able to make dark (don''t make the room dark yet,but find a room
    that you will be able to make dark when we get to that part).'

- en: 'Step 2: Now, I want you to find a candlethat you feel it represents you. It
    could be one of your favourite color...or it could be one that when you pick it
    up you feel something special-it "feels" right. Most imortantly, you need to look
    at this candle as if it is an extension of your heart and soul. I know it sound
    funny, but I am serious. Take as long as you need to find the "perfect'' candle
    for you.'

- en: 'Step 3: Take the candle,and sit in a comfortable position on the floor. Put
    both of your hands around the candle, and hold it in your lap. Now, I want you
    to clear your mind and slow your breathing. Take long, deep, even breathes. Relax.
    When you are relaxed, I want you to think about your past and present. I want
    you to think about who you are as a person-how you feel, how you think, what problems
    you have, and what you truly love in life. As you think of your true self, and
    who you really are as a person-I want you to "think" those thoughts into your
    candle. Visualize every thought you have "transferring" into the candle...if it
    helps, you can visualize a white puffy jet stream travelling away from your head,
    and into the candle in your hands. Focus on this for a few minutes (or longer),
    you''ll know when you''ve put enough of yourself into the candle.'

    as simple as a little stool or even a chair. You can get as "ornate" as you want
    to get, but anything will do.'

    the room. Light the candle.'

    a dark room. This dark room represents the clarity of emptiness and the candle
    represents all that you are.'

    on the flame. Visualize the Magick energy in this candle being released into the
    emptiness and darkness all around you.'

    from the floor, up the walls, to the ceiling. Feel the warmth starting to build
    the room.'

- en: 'Step 9: In your thoughts bring an idea of complete belief in yourself and the
    Magick energy that fills the room-the Magick energy that YOU just sent out. Put
    aside any bad things that have happened to you in the past...cast them aside they
    don''t matter right now. Grab hold of everything that is good in life, everything
    that you have accomplished, and everything that is possible for you with the powers
    you were born with. believe in everything your heart tells you. Think about all
    of the people in this world that accomplished things with Magick-psychics, fortune
    tellers, witches, etc; the same Magick that lies within you. You are not different
    then they are, and if you believe in your Magick, and all of the wonderful miracles
    it can bring you-there is nno stopping the beautiful things that you can accomplish
    in your life and the lives of your loved ones.'

    no less than 7 minutes (the longer, the better). Build the belief up until you
    forget you ever had a single doubt in the past. Adfmit to yourself that you ARE
    special, and are filled with Magick just as much as any other person on this earth...'
