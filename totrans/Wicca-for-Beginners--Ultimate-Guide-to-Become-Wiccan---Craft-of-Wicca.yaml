    know where to start.

    get admitted to. If you decide to become Wiccan, that decision alone is enough
    to start calling yourself Wiccan.

    a poem for the occasion is common.

    don’t know what to commit to.

    a deity and formally declare their dedication to this aspect of the divine.

    Wiccan.

    only thing that should matter to you. Don’t worry what others think.

    of knowledge and spells easy. You will be a part of maintaining a line of ancient
    knowledge.

    rite to be a secret, even to the initiate. The most important thing when going
    to an initiation ceremony is to have the right mindset.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Wiccan. You can commit to the craft itself, a deity, a new name and identity,
    a coven, all of those plus other things, or none of them.

    aspect of Wicca. It is to take from the ancient traditions and use what works
    for you. There aren’t dogmatic beliefs and strict ceremonies that must be followed.

    This means you should jump into your practice, no matter how small it is at first.
    This is what many people have trouble with. They want something more definitive,
    but that’s not necessary.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

- en: Book of Shadows
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Practicing Wicca is basically a combination of internal spiritual practice,
    ceremonies and rites at the [Wiccan holidays](https://craftofwicca.com/wiccan-holidays-wheel-of-the-year-explained/),
    and magick.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to.
  prefs: []

    it is to jump in and log what you do in a Book of Shadows.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At first, this probably means reading books and web pages and copying whatever
    it says exactly. Then you’ll want to tinker with it to fit your style better.
    Switch out a white candle for sandalwood incense and see what happens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll need to learn the basic principles (see [Elemental Magic for Beginners](https://craftofwicca.com/elemental-magic-for-beginners/)
    if you want to know what I mean by that). But once you do learn this, you can
    probably make your own rites and spells without even referencing another one first.

    of what works.

    lose track of how you did a spell that worked great.
  prefs: []

    what they did on what day for what purpose. Then they record how it felt and if
    it worked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I keep my Book of Shadows separate from this type of log. My logging happens
    in a spell journal. Then I only transfer the things I really like over to my Book
    of Shadows so that it is more like a final draft of spells that work.

    other religions.

    else.

    or items used. Wicca can be done practically anywhere with anything by a skilled

    using herbal tea to heal or stimulate or relax for as long as people have been
    cooking.

    think it has to do with the fact that someone drawn to Wicca is often also drawn
    to nature.
