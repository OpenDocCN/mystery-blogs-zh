Sit with your legs tucked under you.
Concentrate. Don't try to see what you'll look like, just focus on having dragon features: wings, a tail, etc.
Chant three times:
''Dragon within the depths of me
In your body, I wish to be
Let me become you if I can
A member of the dragon clan''
If you have an inner dragon, you'll feel a spreading warmth in your chest. You've activated your inner dragon. To become it, chant:
''A dragon's what I wish to be
Come out dragon inside me''
To turn human again, chant:
''A human's what I wish to be
Right now I wish that I were me''
