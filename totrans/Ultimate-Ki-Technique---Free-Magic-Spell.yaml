- en: To attack with ki, do this. When you shoot your ki at something/one, you need
    to shoot it THROUGH the opponent. The reason for this is that the ki will act
    as a sonic boom and create a shockwave. This rupters their ki and will sometimes
    send them crumbling to the ground gassping for air. But there is something to
    remember. Closing the distance increases the results of the attack. When ki travels
    too far, it begins to fall apart. Also, a physical attack that's charged with
    ki is much more devistating. Because there is no space between the ki and the
    opponent.

    both wrists and another at both shoulders with the same programming as the big
    bang attack. When there is sufficient pressure created, let SOME of it expand
    about 1 inch off your arms. Create a wirlpool of mana around your hands to add

    looks like your hands ARE the ki ball. Thrust your hands foward. As your hands
    go foward, so does the wirlpool. Shoot the blast and use the momentum of the wirlpool
    to create a sling-shot effect by swallowing the blast and slinging it towards
    the opponent at a speed of about 150mph. This blast, if done properly, will devistate

- en: The fire ball is a hard move to learn to controll, but it is also extremely
    effective. To start out with, put your hands in the basic ki ball position. Start
    adding Ki energy into your hands, except this time focus as hard as you can into
    making the energy warm. Try to make it as hot as you can. Don't worry, the heat
    will not harm you because it is your energy. Now once you have added a fairly
    large amount of energy to the ball, remove one of your hands away from the ball.
    Now you should have only one hand holding the ball. Raise the hand that is holding
    the ball in the air. Make sure that the ball is in your dominent hand. Grab your
    wrist with your other hand that is free. Now push your ki out of both hands so
    that some of it is comming out of your dominent hand that is holding the ball,
    and some is comming out of the hand that is holding your wrist. Push the energy
    that is holding your wrist into your wrist and into the ball. You know have the
    energy comming out of both hands. Now is the hard part. Start powering up and
    tightening your arm muscles. Focus as hard as you can on the ball turning into
    a huge flaming ball of energy. This is actually easier than it sounds because
    it is your energy. If you focus hard enough, then a friend about 4 feet away will
    probally say something like "Wow! I just saw a flame.", or, "Dang, that thing
    is hot", or something else like that. If you are a beginner, then for your first
    year of making it, the best you will probally make is a very faint ball of fire
    most likely. I would recommend that you have some experience in Pyrokinesis before
    you start really practicing the move because it is easier to perform.

    别担心，热量不会伤害你，因为那是你的能量。 现在一旦你给球添加了相当多的能量，将一只手从球旁挪开。 现在你应该只有一只手拿着球。 将拿着球的手抬起。 确保球在你的主导手中。
    用另一只自由的手抓住你的手腕。 现在将你的气推出来，以便一部分从拿着球的主导手中流出，一部分从拿着你的手腕的手中流出。 将抓住你手腕的手中的能量推入你的手腕和球中。
    现在是难的部分。 开始加大能量并收紧你的手臂肌肉。 尽力专注于球变成一个巨大的火焰能量球。 这实际上比听起来更容易，因为那是你的能量。 如果你足够努力地专注，那么大概4英尺远处的朋友可能会说类似“哇！我刚刚看到了一团火焰”或者“啊呀，那东西很热”之类的话。
    如果你是一个初学者，那么在制作它的第一年内，你最好可能只会制作出一个非常轻微的火焰球。 我建议您在真正练习这一动作之前在火行术方面有一些经验，因为这样会更容易进行。

    Sit down and summon as much energy as you can. Bring all of it inside of you.

    a hole in the palm chakras forming and pouring all that ki into the bottle. Bring
    back your hands and use mind power to create a mana sheild in the shape of the
    bottle so that no ki leaks out of it. If the needed amount of ki was added, it
    should look a little foggy inside of the bottle. I've seen someone light up a
    bottle like a light bulb before(gave me the idea). Program the sheild to keep
    energy in, but not out. That makes it safe to put 1-3 drops of water(particularly
    enchanted) into the bottle. Thus making it an elixer with the 'essence' of ki
    inside of it. ANYBODY who has 1 drop of it, will be fully recovered. I HAVE TESTED
