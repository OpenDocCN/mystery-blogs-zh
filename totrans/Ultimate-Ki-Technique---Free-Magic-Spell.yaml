- en: To attack with ki, do this. When you shoot your ki at something/one, you need
    to shoot it THROUGH the opponent. The reason for this is that the ki will act
    as a sonic boom and create a shockwave. This rupters their ki and will sometimes
    send them crumbling to the ground gassping for air. But there is something to
    remember. Closing the distance increases the results of the attack. When ki travels
    too far, it begins to fall apart. Also, a physical attack that's charged with
    ki is much more devistating. Because there is no space between the ki and the
    opponent.

    emerging and shooting at the opponent. Ram the pole straight through the opponent.
    This will give a visible effect of the damage. It may cause a red mark or something
    the first few times you try it. Practice it on a friend first. But make sure he
    has propper gear on. I did this to a friend of mine before when he wasn't wearing

    Fill your arm with ki as much as you can. This builds up the pressure pushing
    against the block. When you just can't hold in any more, quickly remove the block.
    This will have the effect of a pressure hose. The ki will come racing out at an

    opponent and go into regular ki blast position. Place your hands down by your
    hips and power up with ki flame and spirit up. Push the ki flame in between your
    hands to create a ki ball. Let it expand around your wrists. Double fill the inside
    of the ball with the eternal energy from the spirit up. Now create a block in
    both wrists and another at both shoulders with the same programming as the big

    about 1 inch off your arms. Create a wirlpool of mana around your hands to add

    looks like your hands ARE the ki ball. Thrust your hands foward. As your hands
    go foward, so does the wirlpool. Shoot the blast and use the momentum of the wirlpool
    to create a sling-shot effect by swallowing the blast and slinging it towards
    the opponent at a speed of about 150mph. This blast, if done properly, will devistate
    the opponent and make him gasp for breath. It should take about 10 minutes before
    he can breath normally again.

  zh: 这是我设计的一种技巧，其目的是完全压倒对手并在一次攻击中获胜。站在距离对手约4英尺的地方，进入常规的气功波姿势。将双手放在臀部旁边，并用气焰和灵气增强力量。将气焰推入双手之间，形成气球状的气功球。让它在你的手腕周围扩展。在球的内部双倍填充来自灵气增强的永恒能量。现在在双手腕和双肩上创建一个与大爆炸攻击相同编程的块。当产生足够的压力时，让一部分能量膨胀约1英寸远离你的手臂。在你的手周围创建一圈魔法涡流，以增加球中的能量。将球与手合并，以便在你的心中看起来你的手就是气功球。向前推动你的手。随着你的手的前进，涡流也随之前进。发射爆炸并利用涡流的动量创建一个弹弓效果，将爆炸吞噬并以约150英里/小时的速度把它甩向对手。如果操作正确，这个爆炸将摧毁对手，并使他喘不过气来。大约需要10分钟他才能恢复正常呼吸。

    the sun hitting you. In your mind, visualize the rays of light going straight
    through your body. You must remember that we only are seen because the light reflects
    off of us for other's pupil's to gather which allows you to see. That's why we
    can't see in the dark, because there is no light for the pupil to pick up. If
    the light goes through you, there is no reflection of light for other pupils to
    pick up. This normaly only works in crouds or forests where the is plenty of surroundings
    to throw someone's concentration off.

- en: The fire ball is a hard move to learn to controll, but it is also extremely
    effective. To start out with, put your hands in the basic ki ball position. Start
    adding Ki energy into your hands, except this time focus as hard as you can into
    making the energy warm. Try to make it as hot as you can. Don't worry, the heat
    will not harm you because it is your energy. Now once you have added a fairly
    large amount of energy to the ball, remove one of your hands away from the ball.
    Now you should have only one hand holding the ball. Raise the hand that is holding
    the ball in the air. Make sure that the ball is in your dominent hand. Grab your
    wrist with your other hand that is free. Now push your ki out of both hands so
    that some of it is comming out of your dominent hand that is holding the ball,
    and some is comming out of the hand that is holding your wrist. Push the energy
    that is holding your wrist into your wrist and into the ball. You know have the
    energy comming out of both hands. Now is the hard part. Start powering up and
    tightening your arm muscles. Focus as hard as you can on the ball turning into
    a huge flaming ball of energy. This is actually easier than it sounds because
    it is your energy. If you focus hard enough, then a friend about 4 feet away will
    probally say something like "Wow! I just saw a flame.", or, "Dang, that thing
    is hot", or something else like that. If you are a beginner, then for your first
    year of making it, the best you will probally make is a very faint ball of fire
    most likely. I would recommend that you have some experience in Pyrokinesis before
    you start really practicing the move because it is easier to perform.

  zh: 火球是一个难以控制的动作，但它也非常有效。 首先，将你的手放在基本的气球位置。 开始向你的手加入气能量，除了这次要尽力让能量变得温暖。 尽量让它变热。
    别担心，热量不会伤害你，因为那是你的能量。 现在一旦你给球添加了相当多的能量，将一只手从球旁挪开。 现在你应该只有一只手拿着球。 将拿着球的手抬起。 确保球在你的主导手中。
    用另一只自由的手抓住你的手腕。 现在将你的气推出来，以便一部分从拿着球的主导手中流出，一部分从拿着你的手腕的手中流出。 将抓住你手腕的手中的能量推入你的手腕和球中。
    现在是难的部分。 开始加大能量并收紧你的手臂肌肉。 尽力专注于球变成一个巨大的火焰能量球。 这实际上比听起来更容易，因为那是你的能量。 如果你足够努力地专注，那么大概4英尺远处的朋友可能会说类似“哇！我刚刚看到了一团火焰”或者“啊呀，那东西很热”之类的话。
    如果你是一个初学者，那么在制作它的第一年内，你最好可能只会制作出一个非常轻微的火焰球。 我建议您在真正练习这一动作之前在火行术方面有一些经验，因为这样会更容易进行。

- en: This technique uses a spiral force to hit the enemy from multiple directions,
    then downward spiraling into their organs causing a drill effect(OUCH!). Stand
    in a regular wide legged stance(horse stance) and plave your hands palm out with
    your palms facing the opponent. What you want to do is create a ki 'magnet' that
    will collect the ki and mana within a certain range. Let your ki outside of you
    to be drawn around your body into the magnet. Now make the magnet spin, so that
    the ki it has collected, and will collect, begins to circle as well.

    让你周围的气被吸引到磁铁周围。 现在让磁铁旋转，以便它所收集到并且将要收集到的气开始环绕。
- en: At this point, begin to draw mana into the magnet. The mana should be spiraling
    towards the hands because of the magnet. Now merge the ki with the mana so that
    the ki uses the mana to climb out in to the air and cirlce around your palms as
    one with the mana. Start to charge your arms with any ki you have left. Use the
    ki in your arms to project the magnet out of your hands and through the opponent.
    This will cause the spiral of ki/mana around your hands to go inside-out and follow
    the magnet at a high speed. This will cause the mana and ki to go drilling through
    your opponent.

  zh: 在这一点上，开始将法力引导到磁铁中。 应该因为磁铁而向手螺旋式延伸。 现在合并气与法力，使气使用法力爬出并环绕你的手掌彻底进入空中，与法力合为一体。 开始用你手臂中剩下的任何气来充电。
    使用手臂中的气将磁铁从你的手掌投射并穿过对手。 这将导致围绕你手的气/法力螺旋以高速内翻并跟随着磁铁。 这将导致法力和气对你的对手进行钻孔。

- en: This is the ability to force TONS of ki into a bottle, capsule, water drop,
    or small peice of food, for recoverative purposes. This is a VERY strong healing
    technique that I devised myself. In this I will use a small bottle as an example.
    Sit down and summon as much energy as you can. Bring all of it inside of you.
    Then become 'one' with the ki, and place your hands about 4 inches above the bottle.
    Visualize your palm chakra extending out and reaching the bottle. Fill that chakra
    with ALL the ki in your body at that time(keep enough to stay ALIVE!). Imagine
    a hole in the palm chakras forming and pouring all that ki into the bottle. Bring
    back your hands and use mind power to create a mana sheild in the shape of the
    bottle so that no ki leaks out of it. If the needed amount of ki was added, it
    should look a little foggy inside of the bottle. I've seen someone light up a
    bottle like a light bulb before(gave me the idea). Program the sheild to keep
    energy in, but not out. That makes it safe to put 1-3 drops of water(particularly
    enchanted) into the bottle. Thus making it an elixer with the 'essence' of ki
    inside of it. ANYBODY who has 1 drop of it, will be fully recovered. I HAVE TESTED
    THIS! IT DOES WORK, AND IS SAFE! The only thing that matters is how well you do
    it. And after the technique, or 'ritual', DRAW SOME ENERGY.

- en: This position will send the two "mega" balls created swirling in your arms.
    They should swirl like a circle, with the ball created in your right hand shooting
    into your left arm, then into your chest, immediatly followed by circling back
    into your right again, and vice-versa. This will create a continuing circle for
    the energy, and as it travels over and over in that circle, it will gain more
    momentum and power. The instant that you break the circle by extending your arms
    back out, with your palms facing your opponent, the balls will collide and come
    out through your hands as a devistating shock wave of dissrupted energy. Note
    that this attack is mentally, spiritually, and physically devistating to your
    opponent if fully developed. This should only be used on a living organism as
    a last resort.
