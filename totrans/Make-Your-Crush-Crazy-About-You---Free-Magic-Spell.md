How do you close the circle?

Confusing as this might sound, you cast a circle and close it before the spell, then open the circle at the end [this person just got the terms mixed up] so you cast the circle whichever way works best for you [either look up one if you don't have a circle casting or message me, don't have enough space here] when you're opening the circle you go in the opposite direction/order, so you say thank you to any deities you called in [which isn't needed for this spell] then go to the last quarter [direction] you went to, thank the energy and say goodbye, and walk in the opposite direction giving thanks to each quarter as you go.

Nekoshema I have been trying to figure out how to message you. I would like to ask you something please.

Works. But why would use this?

You may not use it, but I bet many people would love to use it

How many days does this spell will work?

Thanks for the clarification!

is it 5 items of our choice?

Does this work?

Try it for yourself and see. [reading over it, it does seem plausible. be sure you charge and focus your energy for it to work]

can i use thread or a string instead of yarn

Going to try this spell. How many days will the spell be on effective?
