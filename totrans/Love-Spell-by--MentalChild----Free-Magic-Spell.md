**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Candle (Red)

*   Oil (Rose)

*   Paper (Pink)

*   Belief that this will work

Place the candle in the center of the paper but don't light it yet.
Write your name to the left of the candle.
Write your love-to-be's name to the right of the candle.
Now light the candle.
Drip rose oil on both names and say this:

True, you may not love me now
Soon enough you'll begin to know
How much I love you, even still
Now let your deep down love for me show

NOTE: It won't work if it's against the will of the universe. Sorry bros.
