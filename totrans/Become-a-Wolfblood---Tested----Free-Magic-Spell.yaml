  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No. Magick doesn't contradict nature. Since whatever powers/abilities you attribute
    to werewolves would contradict human nature, you won't gain them on the physical
    plane. Any spell that claims you will is fake. You can call on astral werewolves
    or use their symbolism in your craft, but you can't gain powers.

- en: Based on gold eyes in the night, I'm gonna assume this guy's a TVD, Originals,
    and Legacies fan (or at least one of the three). But no, won't work. Even if it
    were possible to turn into a werewolf (and unless someone's hiding some very amazing
    technology from human eyes), you need to be born a werewolf (according to the
    show. I'm just going to use the show's logic since the spell is inspired by it).
    No magick will change or re-write genetic code (biokinesis comes to mind, but
    if that actually works, you won't be able to change it back since wolf minds don't
    work like human minds. You won't be able to keep focus long enough to shift back
    anyway).
