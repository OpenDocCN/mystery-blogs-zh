- en: Your intuition is the Universe’s way of communicating with you. Once you’ve
    cast a spell, the Universe responds by sending the people and circumstances you’ve
    asked for. So, that’s why it’s important to always listen to your gut feelings
    or intuition. That’s particularly true for the days and weeks after you’ve cast
    a spell. If you follow your intuition, the Spirits will be the ones leading the
    way.

    your imagination at work. That’s why there are intuition spells. You can create
    a talisman that you keep with you at can help you receive clearer guidance from

    return your mind to the Third Eye. After your mind is there, you’ll see the symbol,
    which can be almost anything. When you see it, immediately draw it on the paper.
    This symbol represents your Higher self and your higher wisdom.
