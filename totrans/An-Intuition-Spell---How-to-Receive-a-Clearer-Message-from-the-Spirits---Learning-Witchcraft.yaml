- en: Your intuition is the Universe’s way of communicating with you. Once you’ve
    cast a spell, the Universe responds by sending the people and circumstances you’ve
    asked for. So, that’s why it’s important to always listen to your gut feelings
    or intuition. That’s particularly true for the days and weeks after you’ve cast
    a spell. If you follow your intuition, the Spirits will be the ones leading the
    way.
