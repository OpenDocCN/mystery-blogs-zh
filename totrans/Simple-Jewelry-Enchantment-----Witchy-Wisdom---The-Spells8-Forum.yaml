- en: Enchanting jewelry is a very common practice that witches partake in. You can
    enchant rings, necklaces, bracelets - any form of jewelry - for any purpose. This
    enchantment was created to bring the spirit and energy of each element into my
    necklace to carry with me throughout the day.

    element and ask it to bless and charge your jewelry. I don‚Äôt always have something
    written particularly for this. I go with what first comes to my mind because my
    witchcraft is very intuitive.

    I don‚Äôt cast circles, I simply thank the elements and energies for showing up
    to be with me and I make sure they all get an offering as thanks.
