- en: This spell uses the combination of nutmeg and intimate garments in a form of
    sympathetic magic, combined with herbal magic. It is said to keep a partner faithful.
    It obviously can be done at any time, particularly when you suspect that your
    partner may be open to temptation.

- en: Carefully scratch with your burin or the pin your partners initial on one nutmeg
    and your own on the other. Tie them together with the ribbon. Wrap them in the
    underwear and then place in the envelope. Sleep with the envelope under your pillow
    if your partner is away or you are separated from them.

- en: Nutmeg was at one time the most expensive spice available so one would have
    to be fairly serious about the relationship to be willing to lock away such an
    expensive commodity. This spell is probably not to be entered into lightly, nor
    is it designed to keep someone with you against their will.
