# Stop Turning Into a Mermaid

A reversal spell for those who want to get rid of a mermaid tail. If you stop changing, though, it'll hard to start changing again!

## Casting Instructions for 'Stop Turning Into a Mermaid'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Salt

*   Tub of water

*   Towel

*   Shell

*   Sea glass

*   Knife or pin

*   Bowl of water

*   Black candle and white candle

*   Match or lighter

*   Hammer

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Salt

*   Tub of water

*   Towel

*   Shell

*   Sea glass

*   Knife or pin

*   Bowl of water

*   Black candle and white candle

*   Match or lighter

*   Hammer

 Put your legs in the bath, and have them merge into a tail. Then, cover it in salt. Prick your finger over the bowl, then prick your tail and let the blood drip into the bowl. Then, put more salt on your tail and wrap it in the towel before lighting the candles. Start rubbing your tail on the ground to dry it. Concentrate your mermaid energy into the candles until the black contains the negatives and the white the positives. Chant slowly, while holding the sea glass:

"I wish to always have my legs
And never have a tail
Even six feet under water
My toes will never scale
This mermaid blessing quickly changed
And now it is a curse
Quickly, take this tail away
Before it gets any worse
I wish to be human through and through
And run from the sea
As my mermaid body
Is betraying me
And this bond I break
My soul is now set free
And as I end my mermaid life
I remain the human me!"

Your tail should be dry by now, and you should have legs. Smash the shell with the hammer, then blow out the candles, sending the mermaid energy away. Wipe the salt off your legs and clean up, then place the shell pieces in the bloody water and throw it outside. (Don't throw the bowl! Just the water.)

You will never become a mermaid because physical transformation is not real, so this is pointless.
