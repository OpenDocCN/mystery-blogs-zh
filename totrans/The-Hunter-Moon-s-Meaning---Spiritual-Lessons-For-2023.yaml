    appearance after sunset. This grants us extended hours of moonlit evenings. Its

    closely with [the festival of Samhain](https://teaandrosemary.com/samhain-rituals-traditions-ways-to-celebrate/),
    celebrated at the end of October. Samhain marked the end of the harvest season
    and the onset of winter. It was believed that the veil between the physical and
    spiritual worlds was thinnest during Samhain, allowing for greater communication
    with deceased loved ones and the spirit realm. As such, it was a period filled
    with both reflection and reverence.

    and protection during this period.

    rituals, ceremonies, and gatherings particularly potent.

    also for spiritual seekers looking for wisdom and understanding.
