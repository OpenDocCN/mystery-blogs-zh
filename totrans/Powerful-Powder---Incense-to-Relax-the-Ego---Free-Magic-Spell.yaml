- en: This is a very strong mixture and helps to relax and open the mind to anything
    concerning meditation, opening psychic senses, and it may even aid in astral projection.
    If you are going to burn this, take note that only a small amount is needed, probably
    less than a teaspoon if that. If you completely dislike the idea of burning anything,
    simply wear some of it in a purple sachet, maybe with some stones that compliment
    it too. I did both.

    with your fingers, keeping in mind to stay calm as you mix so as to imbue it with
    calming energies. Then crush it as finely as possible with your mortar and pestle.

    Back then I had a small 11-12 dollar mortar and pestle that had issues containing
    any of my powders without spilling a bunch in the process...

    Smoke is bad for your lungs anyway, and just a little is enough to relax you for

    the possible as impossible. It will try to rationalize your intuitive and psychic

    This aspect of your physical reality is necessary for basic survival and your
    fight or flight response. The issue that arises is that in today''s society of
