- en: Obtaining good grades at school can be difficult, as no matter how hard you
    study, there are always factors beyond one’s control that can ruin academic performance.
    Classmates being bullies, unreasonable teachers, stress in other areas of life
    and minor health events (shouldn’t have eaten so many lollies after all!) can
    all add up quickly, distracting a student from the main goal of studying.

    aside to help get good grades at school!

- en: An important thing to remember though is that this spell won’t help if no studying
    is done. In fact, it can make matters worse, as the Universe can get furious when
    someone tries to take advantage of it without putting in the work. However, the
    spell is exceptionally effective for those who have been studying and taking sufficient
    time and effort to learn. In this case, it boosts focus, concentration and good
    luck!
