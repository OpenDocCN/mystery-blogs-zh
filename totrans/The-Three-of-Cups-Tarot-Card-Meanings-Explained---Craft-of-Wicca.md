## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the Three of Cups card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

Here is a new interpretation of the Three of Cups tarot card:

 The Three of Cups tarot card could be focusing on the idea of “tribal connections.” The card depicts three individuals coming together in celebration, which can be interpreted as a symbol of the importance of building and maintaining connections with a tribe, or a group of like-minded individuals.

 In today’s society, where people can feel increasingly isolated and disconnected, the card can serve as a reminder to seek out and nurture connections with others who share similar values, beliefs, and goals.

Another unique interpretation could be focusing on the idea of “creative collaboration.”

 The card’s imagery of three individuals raising cups in celebration can also be interpreted as a symbol of the power of creative collaboration. The card suggests that when people come together and work together, they can achieve great things.

 This interpretation can be applied to various fields, be it art, design, music, business, or any other field where collaboration is key to success. It can serve as a reminder to look for opportunities to collaborate with others and to value the power of teamwork.
