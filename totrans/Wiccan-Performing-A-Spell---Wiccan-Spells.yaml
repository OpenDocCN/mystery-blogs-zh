    starts by cleansing the area and purifying themselves. They may use tools such

    the Wiccan walks clockwise around the designated area, visualizing a sphere of
    protective energy forming around them. This ritual marks the boundary between
    the mundane world and the spiritual realm, creating a safe and consecrated space

  zh: 铸造圆环
- en: Before casting the actual spell, it is customary for Wiccans to create a protective
    circle. This acts as a barrier between the physical world and the spiritual realm,
    preventing any unwanted energies from interfering with your work. To cast the
    circle, start by visualizing a circle of light surrounding you. Walk around the
    perimeter, mentally or physically, and imagine your energy extending to form a
    sacred space. You can call upon the elements, such as earth, air, fire, and water,
    to bless and protect the circle.
