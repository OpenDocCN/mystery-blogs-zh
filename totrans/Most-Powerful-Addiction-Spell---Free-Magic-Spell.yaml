  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is extremely serious work and extremely taxing. IT SHOULD BE DONE IN A
    PROTECTIVE CIRCLE. When dealing with addiction you are dealing with the physical,
    spiritual, and emotional being of the person that is afflicted. It is an ugly
    complicated disease.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To cast your circle. Light a white candle in the center of the area you will
    be working in. Take salt and do a circle big enough for you to work in in a clock
    wise direction. I usually start in the South. When finished with your circle call
    in the 4 Arch Angles Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael to protect you will
    doing your work. Face South and call in Michael to join you. I say the name three
    times and wait until I feel his presence before calling in the next Angel. Call
    in Uriel facing West, Raphael facing North, and Gabriel facing East. Finish by
    facing South again. You are now ready to begin the work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Charge your Green Candle by using the healing oil of your choice. I usually
    start at the top and work my way down to the center and then start again at the
    bottom and work my way to the center charging the candle with the intention to
    heal. Light the candle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clean each and every stone with the power of Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. I
    usually run the stone through the light of the White Candle cleansing it by Fire,
    use White Sage Smoke to cleans it by Air, Water to cleans it by Water, and Salt
    to cleans it by Earth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can consecrate each stone with the healing oil you have selected. Holding
    it in your power hand (the one you write with) and focusing on the purpose of
    each stone will help charge it. I also concentrate on the person I am doing it
    for. Place each stone in the Green Medicine Bag when finished.
  prefs: []

- en: I use the Seals of King Solomon for the purpose of this bag but if you have
    another healing seal that you prefer it can also be used. You will draw the seals
    on parchment with Doves Blood Ink. Make the seals small enough to fit inside the
    bag or you may chose to put them on the bag its self.

- en: Wile creating this spell I found some information on Demons that are associated
    with Addiction according to King Solomon. Deception is the first named Demon and
    has a corresponding Angle named Lamechalal that stops its progress. Strife is
    the second Demon but she is frusterated by Baruchiachel. Klothod is the third
    Demon but is frusterated by Marmarath. The fourth Demon was not named but gave
    a description and corresponding Angle. ''I cause men to forget their sobriety
    and moderation. I part them and split them into parties; for Strife follows me
    hand in hand. I rend the husband from the sharer of his bed, and children from
    parents, and brother from sister.'' ''I have an Angle that frusterates me, The
    Great Balthial.'' The fifth Demon is called Power but is fruterated by Asteraoth.
    The sixth Demon is called Error and is frusterated by Uriel. The seventh Demon
    is called Worst and it makes people worst than they were to begin with It is frusterated
    by a Locust. I got a piece of Locust jewelry for this purpose.

- en: I would also include the names of the Angles that fight the Demons on parchment
    in this bag with a request to each of them to frusterate and cast out the Demons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am doing this work and it is a LONG PROCESS. The materials are often HARD
    TO FIND but worth it. THE DEMONS WILL SENCE YOU GETTING READY TO CAST THEM OUT
    SO BE PREPAIRED. I have experienced ANGER, DOUBT, all kinds of attacks wile doing
    this work or preparing to do it. I have had people report FEAR because the Demons
    have been disturbed and know they will soon be cast out. It is very important
    that the person you are preparing this bag for continue to go to what ever program
    they are attending. THIS BAG WILL HELP THEM but there has to be effort on their
    part too.
