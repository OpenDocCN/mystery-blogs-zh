**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Chamomile

*   Ginseng

*   A cotton ball

*   A picture of the character

*   Almond oil (optional)

*   Clove oil (optional)

*   Honeysuckle oil (optional)

*   Ylang-ylang oil (optional)

On a Friday night or the night of the full moon, light the candle. Fill the bowl with the herbs. Then, mix the herbs with the spoon for one minute. Take a few scoops of the mixed herbs and pour them on the picture. Fold the picture and place it under you pillow. Blow out the candle. Before you sleep, place the cotton ball on your forehead and think about the character while chanting the character's name. (If the character doesn't have the name, make one up.) Now when you sleep, you will dream about the character.

NOTE: For a more effective result, anoint the candle with almond, clove, honeysuckle, or ylang-ylang oil. You can also add almond, clove, honeysuckle, and/or ylang-ylang oil(s) to the bowl and mix it/them with the herbs.
