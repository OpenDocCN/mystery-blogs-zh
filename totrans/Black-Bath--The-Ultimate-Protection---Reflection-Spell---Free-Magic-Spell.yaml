    stick 1-2 inches above your skin, move it side to side, from one arm to the other,
    legs and torso, let your skin soak in the smoke. Do that until stick burns out
    thoroughly. Then after that, rub very thin layer of Black Destroyer oil  all over
    your body.

    and how is it made/where does it come from?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    want to put on themselves.

    I used it, and I confirm its great! It is used for protection, and yes you can
    put it on yourself'

- en: This does appear to be a working ritual, but I am confused why you use Gaelic
    and love items. Black Destroyer Oil can be used in curse breakings and banishings,
    so most of the protection and cleanse is coming from that. The rest of the bath
    has more to do with self love and beauty. Not saying you *can't* do that, just
    not a common combination

- en: Thanks for the comment. I usually work with sexual energies and love spells,
    and that is my work signature, I combine spells in a way so that love and passion
    powers up and multiply effect of the spell. These ingredients here are used to
    boost svadhisthana and muladhara, the root and sacral chakras, to build up those
    lower energies, and make purifying circulation of energies, so as black salt suck
    out the negativities, those other ingredients push in the positive energies in
    you. In a way, its like energy dialisis, cleansing all attachments and in same
    time not leaving emptiness in etheric body nor weaknened spots in aura.
