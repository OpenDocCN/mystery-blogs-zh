    and secrecy, and ''''Shadow Walking'''' is a Sith ritual designed to grant the
    practitioner the ability to cloak themselves in complete invisibility. This ritual
    taps into the dark side of the Force, enabling the Sith to move undetected through
    the physical and metaphysical realms. *NOTE THAT THIS RITUAL DOES NOT GRANT PHYSICAL
    INVISIBILITY BUT IT DOES ACT AS A SORT OF SPIRITUAL/METAPHYSICAL CLOAK TO MAKE
    YOU GO UNNOTICED FROM PRYING EYES.'
