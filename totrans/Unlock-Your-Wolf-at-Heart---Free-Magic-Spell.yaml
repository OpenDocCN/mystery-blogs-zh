    to access my true wolf". Then light the white candle and imagine you energy flowing
    into the flame making it grow. Light the red candle and do the same.

    or go on a spiritual journey, it might serve to gain enlightenment on your path.
    If you are expecting to say this and have a wolf spirit you can change into at
    will, it will not happen, Real Magic does not work that way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then how does real magick work?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Real Magic is a neutral energy found in nature that brings natural change. On
    the physical plane, it is ruled by nature, and does not contradict it. Spells
    focus this energy, charge it with our intentions, and set it on a desired path.
    If this change is unnatural, it will not work. If you are interested in working
    with wolves, research animal spirits and totems as well as the culture and religion
    this concept comes from. Research deities associated with wolves, perhaps even
    astral projection as it is believed they are astral spirits similar to fairys
    who can help on your path. As far as what you saw in movies; flying brooms, physical
    transformation, sparks flying out of wands, none of that is real.

- en: you dont need a spell to ''unlock'' your wolf side. Check out being a therian
    instead, because its quite similar. You dont need magic to embrace who you are.
