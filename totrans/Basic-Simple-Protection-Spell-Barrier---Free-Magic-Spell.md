 ## Casting Instructions for 'Basic/Simple Protection Spell/Barrier'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** Before you go and do this spell right away make sure you read the whole instructions. Sprinkle salt in either a circle around the area you wish to protect or in a line at doorways or windows. A thicker line of salt will be better than a fine line. (If there are any breaks in the salt, evil spirits, dark magick, ect. will be able to either break through your barrier or simply pass through it) DO NOT use this spell in a frequently wet or ever changing area such as a beach, lake, pond, stream, desert, or ocean. This spell is ment for enemies, and or evil spirits, if you consider someone neutral or good they will be able to pass through the barrier. This spell WILL NOT work for someone with bad intention. You also must believe in real magick for this spell to work, do not expect the magic to work the first time. (It didn't for me)
