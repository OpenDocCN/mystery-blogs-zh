    used for those purposes. I subscribe to a 100% positivity approach to Wicca, so
    I will not go into those uses.
  prefs: []

    is never worth it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    draw the negativity into a black candle, and then, as it burns, the flame eats
    the negative energy and releases it.

    but it will often take the form of emotional or psychological strength.

    to learn to do this because the flame meaning is how the candle and fire element
    communicates with you.

    what they mean.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do different flames mean?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A strong flame is characterized by being tall and slender without dancing or
    flickering. A tall still flame means that everything is going according to plan.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A weak flame means that the magic is compromised somehow. Maybe you lost focus
    or didn’t use a good amount of energy. In any event, the more you fear the flame
    will just go out, the more you should consider starting over to ensure good magic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A dancing flame is one that seems strong at times and weak at others—one direction
    one moment and another the next. Dancing flames mean strong magic, but it can
    be a bit unpredictable. It’s possible that part of your intentions has gone awry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A flickering flame usually doesn’t last long. It either gains in strength or
    becomes consistently weak. A sudden flickering without that happening usually
    means another presence has appeared. This could be rogue energy, a spirit or faerie,
    or unfocused energy of your own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you see hints of color in the flame, check the meanings above for what the
    color means. The magic will still work, but it may be leaning toward a slightly
    different interpretation from the original intent.

    note.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is indicating. For instance, a weak flame to the west means the emotional charge
    of the magic is weakening, and so on.

    into the magic of the type given by its direction.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last bit of the candle’s language to pay attention to is the wax.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there is very little dripping of the wax, this is the best sign. Everything
    is balanced and working properly. If the wax only drips on one side, see the above
    directions for what is out of balance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the candle melts everywhere (sometimes called a “quick burn”), it is a sign
    of a lot of passion in the magic. The spell should work, but it might not have
    the lasting effect you’d like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the candle burns down into the wax, leaving walls on all sides, it means
    there is a blockage. The magic has either been prevented by someone (or something)
    else or you didn’t put enough energy into it to succeed.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with everything in Wicca, this will depend greatly. Wicca is a way of life,
    not a quick fix to something. The more impatient you are, the less likely it is
    to work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Think to other types of magic that have succeeded for you and then cut that time
    down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more involved the magic, the longer it will probably take. A simple purification
    spell will work immediately, but a love spell that must change someone’s heart
    could take months.
  prefs: []
