- en: A Venus-Mercury link in your sign on your birthday means you have the gift of
    persuasion and you must use it to the full. What you say must be meaningful, of
    course, but your delivery must be perfect too – and it will be.

- en: The Sun moves into the most sociable area of your chart today and almost immediately
    you will be making plans about where to go and who to see. Don’t do it all at
    once and exhaust yourself though. Keep something in reserve.

- en: Make peace with someone you have fallen out with in recent weeks. Looking back
    you will realize it wasn’t such a big deal, certainly not the kind of thing you
    would want to sacrifice a friendship for. Say sorry and move on together.

    the situation? Of course you do! As the Sun moves into your sign you have the
    cosmic right to grab what you can get – so long as it does not belong to anyone
    else!

- en: You must not allow yourself to be intimidated by people who shout and make a
    scene. The planets indicate it is just an act to make themselves look bigger and
    more important than they really are. Ignore them and they’ll go away.

- en: You probably won’t be in the mood for work today but that’s okay. You will accomplish
    more in the long-term if you slow down and give your physical, mental and emotional
    batteries a chance to recharge. They’re all running a bit low.

    career area of your chart. Employers and other important people will be watching
    you closely, and may even put you to the test, so make sure they are impressed.

    must be told in no uncertain terms that you have no intention of falling for their
    tricks. The Sun moves in your favor today so there is no need to cheat.

    dealing with people who know how to play on your fears. Take what they tell you
    with a large pinch of salt. Find out the facts for yourself.

    again when they see how energetically you go after your dreams. Don’t waste time
    on thinking – do what needs to be done with all your heart and strength.

    will become overly sensitive and start putting other people’s needs ahead of your
    own. The planets warn you should be looking out for number one.

    that a more positive phase is beginning. Your confidence will be so high over
    the next few weeks that if you put a name to your dreams they will surely come
    true.

    been a fun time for socializing and to say you have been generous is a huge understatement.
    You cannot afford to keep paying for people out of your own pocket.
