# Contact a Deceased Loved One

  Rated 5/5 Stars

A spell to feel the energy of and maybe even dream of a deceased loved one. This is a pretty advanced spell due to how it requires intense energy and will maybe manipulate your emotions.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Contact a Deceased Loved One'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   a picture of your loved one

*   a white candle

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   a picture of your loved one

*   a white candle

 Preferably, cast a circle of purification in your own tradition. See 'Druid Protective Circle' for a possible way. 

Light the candle and sit in a comfortable position. For as long as you see fit (usually 30-60 minutes for me), meditate on this loved one. Think of the fun times, the hard times, and remember them. Pay homage to their life and their accomplishments. 

Hold the candle in your hands. Chant:

I feel the warmth of your body, the warmth of your soul. I hold you in my arms, my heart, and soul. Please join me, (insert name). 

As you look at his/her picture, begin to feel the warmth of the candle envelop your hands. Feel the warmth climb up your arms, down your body, and cover your entire body. Sit, listen, and experience. 

You will likely smell them, or feel their energy. It is also possible to hear them, see them, or dream of them.
