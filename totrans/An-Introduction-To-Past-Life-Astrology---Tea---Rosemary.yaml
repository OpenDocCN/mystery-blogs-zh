    in learning about your karma and working through it. The only past lives that
    show up in your birth chart are the ones that are especially impactful to your
    life now, mainly because you have karma that still affects you from these lives.

    will give you some clues into your past life astrology. Even though one sign can
    mean many different things (e.g. Aries can be a warrior, a self-starter, someone
    with anger issues, a loner, etc.), the sign gives you a good basis to start learning
    about a past life.

    surrounded by a lot of people. If you south node is conjunct Venus, you were either
    really beautiful (such as a model) and therefore lived your life in the limelight,
    or you had a romantic relationship that made you the center of attention. I image
    people who are on the bachelor will have this type of south node in their next
    lifetimes.

    placement but your south node is in Aries, then this will mean that your past

    you were a wrestler or a general in the army.

  id: totrans-40

    have no need of karmic memories because you have paid off your karma, then these
    placements will no longer show up in your chart. So, if you *do* have placements
    in the 12th house, this means you have not yet paid off your karma yet, therefore
    the life is rather recent.
  id: totrans-41

    These placements are inside the walls of the 12th house that were created by fear
    and guilt. In some way, your own negative feelings about these past life events
    manifested these walls that have “trapped” the planets in your 12th house.

    this life.

    depending on the house.

    life. Saturn square Venus, as mentioned, means that you’ll enter into karmic relationships
    with the same people this time, but Saturn square Mars would indicate that you
    will run into past life enemies.
