    the birth chart. We’ve all had many lives so of course one birth chart can’t show
    *every* past life, but I do find that it shows us the most *relevant* past lives

    planets, signs, and aspects mainly show up *because* you have karma in this life.
    Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a reason for these placements to appear in your chart.

    in learning about your karma and working through it. The only past lives that
    show up in your birth chart are the ones that are especially impactful to your
    life now, mainly because you have karma that still affects you from these lives.

    that the south node is *much* more important when looking into past life astrology.
    The north node represents your soul’s purpose and who you are becoming, while
    the south node represents who you *were.*
  prefs: []

    the qualities that you bring into this life (from a past life), but it can also
    give you a lot of clues into who you were in the past life.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, you’ll want to look at the **sign** that your south node is in. This
    will give you some clues into your past life astrology. Even though one sign can
    mean many different things (e.g. Aries can be a warrior, a self-starter, someone
    with anger issues, a loner, etc.), the sign gives you a good basis to start learning
    about a past life.

    surrounded by a lot of people. If you south node is conjunct Venus, you were either
    really beautiful (such as a model) and therefore lived your life in the limelight,
    or you had a romantic relationship that made you the center of attention. I image
    people who are on the bachelor will have this type of south node in their next
    lifetimes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sign will also influence this. If you have that south node in the 11th house
    placement but your south node is in Aries, then this will mean that your past
    life happened surrounded by being, but it was because of your Aries nature. Maybe
    you were a wrestler or a general in the army.
  prefs: []

    due to your words and social skills. You might have been a writer, storyteller,

    a trine to Juno would indicate a well-placed marriage in your past life. [Juno

    have to do with a past life marriage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Trines and sextiles are usually positive, while squares and oppositions indicate
    difficulty. Conjunctions are the *strongest* aspect, but they aren’t necessarily
    good or bad. A conjunction means that your past life was deeply impacted by the
    planet to which it is conjunct.

    houses have a specific meaning, and the 12th house rules the unconscious mind
    and all things hidden. Of course, this also includes past life astrology.
  prefs: []

    12th house.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Planets in the 12th house will give you a clue as to who you were in a past
    life. Usually, these planets in the 12th house indicate qualities you had in a *recent*
    past life, possibly the life just before the one you’re living now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is that *karmic memories* sit in the 12th house. When you
    have no need of karmic memories because you have paid off your karma, then these
    placements will no longer show up in your chart. So, if you *do* have placements
    in the 12th house, this means you have not yet paid off your karma yet, therefore
    the life is rather recent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that 12th house placements in past life astrology are usually a bit difficult.
    These placements are inside the walls of the 12th house that were created by fear
    and guilt. In some way, your own negative feelings about these past life events
    manifested these walls that have “trapped” the planets in your 12th house.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We often struggle with the planets in our 12th house and with properly expressing
    them. This is usually because in a past life, we *did* have these qualities, and
    they have been karmically limited.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look at the planets (and the signs that they’re in) that appear in your 12th
    house and see if you can piece together a storyline about who you may have been
    in a recent past life as well as the karma that you incurred.

- en: Saturn
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to the 12th house, Saturn governs past life karma. The difference is
    that Saturn indicates a *lesson* we had in a past life that we did not manage
    to learn completely. Therefore, we must *continue* to learn that same lesson in
    this life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn will show the *limitations* of our past life. For example, with Saturn
    in Capricorn, you were limited in a business-sense in a past life. You probably
    struggled with your bosses or with advancement, or even with social status, all
    depending on the house.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not be the same, but the *lesson *will feel the same.

    Saturn alone can be hard to read, but Saturn square Venus is much easily and clearly
    indicates past life love karma.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Squares to Saturn can also indicate what souls you may see from that same past
    life. Saturn square Venus, as mentioned, means that you’ll enter into karmic relationships
    with the same people this time, but Saturn square Mars would indicate that you
    will run into past life enemies.

    past life astrology readings (mainly because I think it’s more useful to focus
    on pain points rather than on the benefits that we already reap), it can be fun
    to see where you naturally excel.

    usually means that some events in that past life were *so* negative that the energy
    of this planet is suppressed.

    together.
