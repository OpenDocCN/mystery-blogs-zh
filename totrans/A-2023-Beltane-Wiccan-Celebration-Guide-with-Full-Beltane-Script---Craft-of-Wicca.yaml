- en: Beltane has its roots in the ancient Celtic festival of Beltane, which was celebrated
    in Ireland, Scotland, and other parts of Europe. The festival marked the midpoint
    between the spring equinox and the summer solstice and was considered a time of
    transition and rebirth.

    Flora, who represented fertility, growth, and abundance. People would light bonfires
    and dance around them, hoping to gain the blessings of the gods for their crops,
    livestock, and families.

    Christian calendar as May Day, but many of the pagan traditions remained. Today,
    Beltane is celebrated by Wiccans and other neopagan groups as a time to honor
    the earth and the renewal of life.
