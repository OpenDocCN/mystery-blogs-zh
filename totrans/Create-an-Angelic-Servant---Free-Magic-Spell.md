# Create an Angelic Servant

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This is how to make an spiritual Angelic servant to do your bidding. Awesome for sending blessings or healings.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   (for second version) any object you can wear or carry around. A ring or coin, for example.

## Casting Instructions for 'Create an Angelic Servant'

Version one: Mission Angelic Servant

This version of the Angelic Servant will be created, carry out your intention, and then ether merge with your energy or return to the Realms of Angels.

Go into a meditation the usual way you do. Be sure to cleanse and center yourself.

When you are ready, see light above you. The light is everywhere above you, and bows down like someone is holding a large blanket high up. Beyond this is infinite light from the realm of the Angels. Heal the Angels singing and sense their presences above.

Now use ether one of these visualizations. The first is to visualize a beam shooting down from the light and welling up into a ball in front of you. The second is to see the light moving and a drip of light falls and is suspended before you, like a large rain drop.

This ball is Angelic Light, made from the pure Light of Source infused with that of the Angels. See the light as is moves  shimmering, pulsing light, and rippling like water. Try to make the ball as solid and concentrated as possible, and add as much light as you need. Give your servant a name, or ask it what it would like to be called. This sphere has a consciousness of its own, but is yours to command. It doesn't have the ability to do anything that isn't in the highest good of all, so it is important to tell it that you are it's master/commander, it is your servant, and that  should your request not be in the highest good of all  it will perfect it so that it is.

Now think of your intention in exact detail of what you would like to be done and how it should happen, as well as in what order, if any. Think of these things as clearly as possible, and then send the instructions mentally into the Angelic Servant. Be careful to include that, once the task is finished, it must return to you and merge itself with your energy completely or return to the Angelic Realms.

Think of how you can quickly state what you want in one small sentence, then command it using that sentence. For instance, ''Go send ___ A large package of Source Light, then return to me and completely merge with my energy.'' or, ''Go heal ___ and return to me and completely merge with my energy.'' If you would like, add a time limit. For example, ''Go send healing to ___ for three days, then return to the Angelic Realms from which you came.''

After you are finished instructing, mentally fling the Servant off to do its job.

Version two: Bound Angelic Servant

This version will create an Angelic Servant and bind it to an object (ether by link or possession). Whoever is wearing/carrying or has that object within three feet of them, the Angelic Servant will work on them.

Link Bound:
Do the meditation in which you create the Angelic Servant, then program it to do what you want. For this example, we are going to create a healing Angelic Servant. have your object in front of you before hand. See an energetic cord streaming down from the Servant to the object which you would like it to be bound to. The cord touches the object, and the energy from it completely fills it. Note that the cord is an extention of the Servant, like an arm, so the Servant is villing the object with it. The link method allows the Servant to move around, while having its energy channeled through the object. While strengthening the cord, send your intention of how far away you will allow the Servant to travel. You can let it go wherever, or maybe only a few feet away. Make it very clear and sent the intention into the cord. State it clearly (mentally or verbally), like, ''Servant, you are forever bound to this ___ by your cord until release. You may travel to wherever you wish.'' or an alternate ending, ''You may never stray more than three feet away from the ___.''

From here, you program the Servant will what you would like. So we send the intention of what kind of healing we wish it to give to whoever has the object near or on them. Make it clear that it is to only affect those who are NEAR, are WEARING, or are CARRYING the object  no one else. Also make it clear if it should only affect one person at a time, or more if many are near/touching the object.

Possession bound:

Follow the instructions for Link Bound, but instead of creating a link, see the Servant actually going INTO the object fully and completely. Give it the command, ''Servant, you are bound to remain INSIDE this ___ forever until release.''

When you're finished giving it instructions, see a white layer of light covering the object, sealing the Servant in.

HOW TO RELEASE THE ANGELIC SERVANT FROM ITS OBJECT:

Chant to the servant, ''Servant, you are now released from ___!'' If you did the link method, See its energy draining from the object and the cord slowly retracting and the energy returning to the sphere of the Servant. If you did the possession method, remove the white layer (by fading, draining, shattering, lifting, etc.) completely, and then see the energy of the servant slowly coming out of the object. If it is still in the shape of the object, that's fine!

Now command the object to ether merge completely with your energy or to return to the Angelic Realms. Do this psychically as well as with a statement. ''Servant, you must now merge completely with my energy,'' or ''Servant, return to the Angelic Realms from which you came!'' Note, you may need to say this more than once.

I have a lot of experience and I combined version one and version two and it's WORKS for me...

I have a few questions: 1.)Is it possible for this to backfire/are thier any possible negative side effects? 2.)How much experience should a person trying this have? 3.)What are the limitations of the 'Angelic Servant'?

[note: i work with Dragons and deities, not angels] 1\. any spell has the potential to backfire. this spell sounds like you're either pooling your own energy to create a servitor in the shape of an angel, or you're calling on an angel to assist you. if you're using your own energy the spell would just not work, you shouldn't feel any negative effects. if you're calling on angels, they will either ignore you, or they may try and teach you a lesson if you're disrespectful, but it wouldn't be something like ''burn your house down'' as angels are more positive by nature. 2\. if you know how to charge/ground/shield energy, you should have enough experience to tackle any spell. 3.don't expect them to help you move furniture, but they could whisper in your friend's ear ''you should help ali move'' thus influencing your friends to assist you. [or, to put it another way, they're limited by nature, they are not physical beings, so they cannot interact with the physical, but they cn bless you]
