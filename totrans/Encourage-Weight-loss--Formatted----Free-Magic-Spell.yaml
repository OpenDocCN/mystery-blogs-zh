- en: 'This ritual/ spell, creates a talisman, because it''ll help you keep the magic
    with you and active. This process will be long, annoying, and draining, but remember
    that the more work you put into a spell, the more you get out. Before you start
    worrying about supplies for a talisman, dont worry. By talisman I mean cheap paper
    piece of junk that you can fit in your pocket. The way that I get magic to stick
    to talismans is by using the old runic alphabet Elder Futhark.   Each rune corresponds
    to a letter, has a name, and carries magical meanings. Runes were used by pagan
    priests in scandanavian countries for divination and magic. Spells of magic doesnt
    carry font support for runic letters, so Ill just be giving you the names of the
    runes in English and relying on you to google them so you know what they look
    like.   Before you even start, you are going to have to create a bindrune for
    yourself. A bindrune is like a signature and it represents YOU in any spell that
    involves runes. To make one, google Elder Futhark and find the two/three runes
    that represent the intitialls of your name. Then write them on top of eachother
    in a pleasing and semetrical way. You might enjoy this, as bind runes, and the
    runes that make them up can reveal something about your personality. READ ALL
    INFORMATION BELOW BEFORE BEGINNING. There is a lot of prepwork and a lot of the
    magic requires personal knowledge   The runescript (series of rune letters youre
    going to use):'

    about what each runes place is in the spell and visualize it happening to you.
    As you do this some energy will leak from you, through the pen and ink and into
    the shape of the rune. Remember that runes are magical by their very nature so
    this is adding a lot of juice to the spell. *Remember that while you write your
    bindrune, write the parts of it in order of your initials, chant the name of the
    rune component youre currently writing, and think about what that part of your
    name means to your identity

    them, but I've been told they have power because they're liked with spirits [or
    the runes are spirits, either way, it's like working with a faerie or other nature
    spirit] You can't simply draw a rune and expect it to work. You need to introduce
    yourself, ask for help and leave an offering. If you don't already work with runes,
    I would begin the process before casting this spell.
