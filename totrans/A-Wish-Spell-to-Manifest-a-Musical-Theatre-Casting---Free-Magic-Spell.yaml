- en: This is a spell that I came up with to help me in the future with auditions.
    Remember that with every spell comes intention and action. Don't expect spells
    to work if you don't act on them. Put your intuition into everything. And most
    of all, do your research. This spell will work for plays, band auditions, etc.
    Feel free to change up the wordings to how you see fit. Blessed be.
