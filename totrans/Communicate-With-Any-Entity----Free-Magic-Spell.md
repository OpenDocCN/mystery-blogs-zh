**You will need the following items for this spell:**

 First you must write in bold letters on the front of the book "Geniec" Then number each page. When youve done that, stimulate your mind. Think of love or a favorite song if you want. When you think you are stimulated, from the bottom of your heart ask yourself, "How stimulated am i on a scale 1-10" You should feel an answer come to you, if you are an 8 or higher, thats perfect. Now in the book write "I'd like to communicate with an entity (whatever you want to know about. ) For example I want to communicate with an entity that has telekinesis." Now write, "are you there?" An answer comes to you, write it down. Now ask it's name. Again write it down. Continue asking it whatever questions you want. When you are done, write, you are dismissed.

Dose this work ?

I would say... right idea, wrong process. What is being described here is commonly referred to as 'automatic writing'. This is a form of channelling/mediumship where the idea is to open one's unconscious/subconscious awareness and give it (and any entities who wish to operate through you) a means of expression.

The magic isn't in the book, or how you prepare the book. It comes from yourself and your mental state. The goal should be to use meditation and relaxation to become calm and open to the idea of allowing your hand and arm to be controlled by outside ideas and efforts.

Place a pen or pencil into your hand, rest your arm on the table, with your hand on the page. Imagine it floppy and soft like a cooked noodle. If you feel tension or an urge to move your hand, fingers, wrist, or arm allow it to move. Lightly scribble or draw small spirals or circles to create some movement if you want, then allow intuition and subconscious urging to take over.

It is also generally helpful to not look at your hand or the page, or do so as little as possible (such as to landmark/ move to a different place on the page). Watching what is going on makes the conscious mind try to make sense of and/or control the motion, effectively letting the conscious mind get in the way.
