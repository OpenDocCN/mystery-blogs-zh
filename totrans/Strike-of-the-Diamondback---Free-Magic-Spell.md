Open lid. Place picture of enemy in center of diamond and set venom on top. Light your candles, get in your meditative state and say:

"Mighty diamondback, serpent strong

Glare at this enemy, who did me wrong

Rise and draw back, your defensive state

Prepare to strike and prepare their fate

Strike, strike, and strike again

With fury, rage, venom so bane."

Place the picture in the jar and seal. Focus on the picture in the jar and say:

"As the venom runs through your veins

Let it bring you torture and pain

Ache and sting you can't explain

Unbearable torture, I say it again

Mighty diamondback I thank you now

Finish the work, you know how."

Take the jar outside and bury it. Finish by saying:

"It is done."

Would this also work if I have their full name written down or does it have to be a picture

You could use theyre name and dob as a tag lock however it would me more efficient and powerful if you used a picture.
