# Minerva Jane's Love Cider

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This spell, or well concoction, is a love spell, in the form of cider. This spell has worked for several of my friends, and seems to work quite well. Now To be clear, this does not MAKE someone fall in love with you. It strengthens the already existing love between two people.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Minerva Jane's Love Cider'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   2 red apples

*   3 green apples

*   Pot or cauldron

*   Cinnamon

*   Vanilla extract

*   1 blender

*   1 Chalice

*   1 piece of amethyst

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   2 red apples

*   3 green apples

*   Pot or cauldron

*   Cinnamon

*   Vanilla extract

*   1 blender

*   1 Chalice

*   1 piece of amethyst

 Fill your pot with water and bring to a boil. Cut apples into 6 pieces. Add apples to boiling water. Wait until apples begin to get soft. Pull apple slices out of the pot and put into the blender. Blend until it looks like apple sauce.

Add a dash of cinnamon to the boiling water. Add blended aples to the water and stir. Add another dash of cinnamon.  Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes.

While you are waiting for the mixture, take the amethyst in your power hand, and focus your energy into it. Once you have done so, imagine your energy going into the mixture. After the 10 minutes is up, pour the mixture into your chalice and drink the whole cup. If your love is there have them do the same, if not keep the mixture in the fridge until you see your love.
