    show reverence to [**Animal Spirit Wisdom**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/spirit-animal-familiar/healing-medicine-spirit-animal-guide-totem/)
    in numerous ways. In some settings the person might consult animal wisdom to help
    in healing or to predict the weather. In another, a hunted animal will receive
    prayers and offerings to thank its spirit and to give the creature peace. Some
    ancient myths even depict the Earth itself as a great animal, such as a Turtle
    or Buffalo. These examples give us a starting point for creating an honorable
    relationship with Animal Spirits and being receptive to their wisdom.

    Shamans see Spirit Animals as an integral part of this world as well as in the
    astral landscape. One story from the Chippewa tribe in Canada illustrates the
    way in which animals show us better ways of living. A local surveyor determined
    to build a dam at one specific location. A Medicine Man from that tribe told him
    this was a terrible idea. When asked about his assertion, the shaman replied that
    since no beavers were using that earth, then it was obvious that the land was
    no good for human dams either. Scientific testing proved the shaman correct. Here
    animal wisdom allowed him to make a quick, accurate judgment that had taken engineers
    weeks to complete!

    Many old mystical stories tell of a time when people were much closer to the animal
    world. In fact, the affiliation was so close that humans communicated freely with
    animals. Exactly what form this communication took isn’t clear. It may have been
    verbal, empathic, or through some type of mimicry. Whatever the form, the knowledge
    seems to have been mostly lost over the ages.

- en: For any of us to return to a more complete two-way rapport, however, will require
    a change in attitude. We will have to start regarding animals, once thought of
    as inferior, as being worthy of our attention. Each creature is a spirit like
    us housed in a temporary form−a spirit with insights to share if we but stop and
    listen. Among the most important of these insights is how to live presently, in
    this moment, totally at peace with self. Our animal cousins do not fret over the
    past or what hasn’t happened yet; they do not strive to be like one another. They
    simply live now, content with the form that Spirit gave them.

- en: Another way of gaining Animal Wisdom and potentially learn natural animal languages
    is through what Shamans call the middle world journey. Here, Spirit Animals can
    instruct us on numerous things, including ways to better understand and unite
    with the Earth. Exactly which animal you call upon to assist you depends greatly
    on what you want to learn, do, or change in yourself. Someone seeking to strengthen
    his or her ties to all of life’s network, for example, would do well to call on
    the spider spirit for aid.

    for animals helps greatly in determining the best choice. That’s only a starting
    point, however. Seers and sages alike recommend getting to know as much as you
    can about that creature’s natural behavior before trying to call upon them for
    aid. This is simply polite. You don’t randomly call on a stranger you don’t know
    anything about in human interactions. The Spirit Animal realm should be no different.
