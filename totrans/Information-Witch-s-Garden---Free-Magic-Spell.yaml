    As witchcraft is an Earth religion, we feel a spiritual rush when sinking our
    hands into the soil or watching a plant grow to maturity. These are the energies
    we celebrate in our rituals, the handiwork of our Mother Gaia.

- en: Many of us find ourselves in urban situations. I live in an apartment in a mid-sized
    city. I don't have the land for a beautiful fenced garden. Maybe someday. But
    for now, I garden in containers. I find I can grow enough herbs for my magical
    needs if I choose my plants wisely. What started as two pots on the front step
    has now grown into 15 or 16 large containers. Even though I'm a city person, I
    can still plant and harvest by the Moon signs, work ritual over my seeds and plants,
    harvest them magically, and dry them for future magical and medicinal use.

    me a gardening notebook, a recipe book, and a place to share my magical garden.
    I've put these pages together in conjunction with a Witches Garden class I'm teaching
    at Dracona Pagan Web. We should have much to share as the class progresses.

    for divination? Constantly smudging the house with sage? These herbs would certainly
    have a place in your garden. Check out my Magical Uses of Herbs pages and find
    plants to meet your needs that are well suited to your area. Don't know which
    plants grow well in your area? Take a look at this planting zone chart for the
    US. Research this carefully. I live on the cusp of two zones. An Internet search
    revealed that I live in Zone 6b. As you research your herbs, check to see which
    zones they grow best in. If you are container gardening, you have a little more
    leeway here. You have the ability to drag your plants indoors if the weather does
    not accommodate them. That can be a hassle, though, and I stand by the idea of
    growing plants native to your area as much as possible. This puts us in tune with
    the cycles and seasons of the land -- the land where we live. Of course, I don't
    see many patchouli plants in the wild here, and I grow it on a regular basis,
    so you will find yourself growing exotic plants at times.

    research. One way to keep my notes straight is to create pages for each plant,
    listing magical, edible, and medicinal uses, as well as cultivation and propagation
    information. Does this plant grow best from seed or should I buy a plant? What
    sort of soil does it need? What are the sun and water requirements? I figure all
    that out before I buy the first seed. Of course, this is a process I continue
    throughout the growing season as I add new plants. Like me, though, I think you
    will find it fun to get lost in garden dreams while the freezing rain is pelting
    outside. How Do I Put the Magick in my Garden?

    mundane garden? Number one, you've chosen your herbs to match your magical intent.
    When grown, they will be blessed and charged in a magic circle to assist in your
    spellwork and ritual. But we can bless and charge our seeds and plants during
    the growing process as well, infusing them with magical energy.

    whenever you begin to work with the seed (some need to be in a growing medium
    well before Ostara). In all gardening matters, work with the cosmic energies of
    the Moon. Find a Moon sign and phase guide and follow it. Here''s a quick rule
    of thumb, although it might vary from plant to plant:'

    Moon signs of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. There are some exceptions: Plant garlic
    during a new or waxing moon in the sign of Scorpio or Taurus. Root crops should
    be planted during a waxing or full moon in Taurus. Plant vines and flowers in
    Libra during a new or waxing moon. Sage needs to be planted in Pisces, Scorpio,
    or Cancer during a full moon. Valerian: Gemini or Virgo during the new or waxing
    moon.'

    The rune Berkana is particularly well suited for planting. Put crystals and stones
    in the soil to energize plants. Moss agate is the gardener's stone. Charged and
    placed in the soil, it will assure the abundant growth of your garden. Other agates
    and quartz crystals work fine as well.

- en: Magically charge the water used to nourish your plants. This can be as simple
    as saying an incantation over the watering can or setting water out under the
    full moon to charge. Sprinkle a few fertility herbs or a moss agate in the water
    while charging. Again, draw fertility runes on your watering can and charge it
    with abundance.
