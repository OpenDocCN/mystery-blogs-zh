Give your spell making skills some rest and refreshment in the 3 preceding dark days and do the spell on the night of the new moon. The brown candles will represent your dream job and burn the green candle, since the color represents prosperity. Finally, there’s a fourth candle that represents you or the person with whom the spell is being cast on behalf.

Your magic will be more potent if the color associated with yours or the other person’s astrological sign. You should set aside an appropriate time for the spell since the candles should burn out completely rather than being extinguished. For the spell you need two brown candles, one personal candle, one green candle, an essential oil and incense associated with prosperity such as cinnamon or ginger.

Start by anointing all the candles with the oils. Work them towards yourself if you’re casting the spell for your own needs but work away from you if you’re casting the spell for someone else. Place one of the brown candles at the center of your altar, with a green candle to the right and the personal one to the left.

Light up the personal candle and repeat the following words.

*‘Please open the way,*
*please clear mine or {mention the other person’s name) sight,*
*bring me or (the other person) the chance,*
*that is mine or (the other person’s) by right.*
*And let it be done that it harm no one.’*

Next, you should light the green candle and repeat the following words.

*‘Good luck be mine or (the other person), and victory,*
*with your help will come my or (the other person)’s way*
*and let it be done that it harm no one.’*

Next, you should light up the brown candle and repeat the following words.

*‘Opportunities and rewards I see*
*and as I do so must it be*
*and let it be done that it harm no one.’*

On each of the following seven nights (or till it has burned out completely), you should light up the second brown candle for nine minutes. Focus on the flame and meditate on the job you want or what you want the other person to get. Imagine how much better things will be when the spell works and believe it will actually work.
