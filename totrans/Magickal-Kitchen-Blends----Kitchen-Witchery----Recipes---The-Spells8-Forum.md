Four different blends you can use – all ingredients can be found in your kitchen, local farmers market, grocery store or garden!

I love how simple and easy these are…and ALL the ingredients are easily accessible.

I did add a warning to this video too! Not all things labeled “natural” are good for everyone.

**Example**: Mugwort can not be consumed by pregnant women. It can cause miscarriage!

Has anyone else used kitchen magick before?
