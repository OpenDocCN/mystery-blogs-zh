- en: To start, you will want to grab the black crystals and charge them for one full
    day / 24 hours. To charge them, you put them on a window ledge or a place with
    natural lighting. Try not to disturb or move them during this process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the crystals are charging, you can get the cloth string bag ready. You
    will want to put sage leaves in the bag. Sage is used in this spell because of
    its protection, immortality, and longevity properties. Next, for purity purposes,
    you can add the dried white rose pedals (optional). Lastly, you will add a pinch
    of salt. If you have ever heard of the Circle of Salt, then you would know that
    salt is used to make magick protection barriers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the crystals are charged, add them to the string bag with all the other
    ingredients. The moment the bag is closed / sealed, you shall not open it. If
    the bag is opened, the protection properties will be released, and will no longer
    be as useful as it was before.
