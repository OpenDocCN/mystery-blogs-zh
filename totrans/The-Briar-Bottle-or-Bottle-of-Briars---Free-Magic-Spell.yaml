    grasshopper in the bottle. Once your liquid is ready, gently pour your hot liquid
    into the bottle, over the other ingredients. It is a good idea to use a funnel
    to avoid making a mess.

    of the bottle, as there has to be enough to kill the grasshopper in the bottle.
    Whether it be because of the heat or drowning in it.
