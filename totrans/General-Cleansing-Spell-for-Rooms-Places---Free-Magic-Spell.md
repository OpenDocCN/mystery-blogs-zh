# General Cleansing Spell for Rooms/Places

I'm not sure if this is a spell, or a ritual, but I used it to cleanse my room and in my belief, it worked.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Sage

*   A crystal that personally represents you

*   Incense you like (I used jasmine and chamomile)

*   A mirror dish, or a dish

*   A white candle

*   Some Luna-charged water

*   A bowl for the water

*   Some salt

*   Knowledge of North, South, East and West directions (If you are not cleansing a room)

*   Belief

## Casting Instructions for 'General Cleansing Spell for Rooms/Places'

 You may do this with others or just yourself. I find it easier to do this with others, seeing as the Chant includes multiple responses.

**If you are cleansing a room, follow these instructions:**

1\. Go to the place you wish to cleanse

2\. Place the dish on a desk, or the ground.

3\. Place your selected crystal on the dish.

4\. Put some sage around the crystal, on the dish.

5.Set up the bowl next to the dish.

6\. Pour the Luna-charged water in the bowl.

7\. Add salt to the water, along with some sage.

8\. Light the candle. **Do not blow out the candle, until the spell is done.**

9\. Light the incense.

10\. Chant: 

Out goes the clutter,

Out goes the mess,

Out goes the negativity,

All bad in this space.

- Be gone!

This is a place of peace,

A place of rest,

May there be no anxiety,

And stress,

-Be gone!

I/We cleanse this space for peace.

i/We transform ourselves for peace.

11\. Walk around the room and say " We cleanse this space for peace".

12\. Put out the incense.

For this is our special place.

The ritual is done,

So mote it be.
