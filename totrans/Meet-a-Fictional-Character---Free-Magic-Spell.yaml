    so make the most of it and have a nice chat with them.

- en: I can list plenty of facts that make people sad. Genocides throughout history
    for example. You shouldn't avoid facts simply because it makes you sad. Yes, depending
    on the age of the person you might wish to avoid stating certain facts [telling
    a child Santa isn't real for instance] but as we grow, we should be able to hear
    difficult truths and accept them. Magick is real. You can use it to bring change
    into your life, however, it has to be natural change because, on the physical,
    that's how magick works. You could create a thoughtform designed off your favourite
    character, you could also look into astral projection and see if you can create
    a fictional character on the astral. Unfortunately, the physical has more rules
    and limitations.

- en: As others have said, it will not literally let you meet a fictional character
    as if they are real. They're fictional. However, it could trick your subconscious
    into creating your own perception of that character as a sort of thought form
    -- think something Jungian here -- and you can have a conversation. However, you
    would be speaking with an aspect of yourself, expressed through your concept of
    the character.

  zh: 正如其他人所说，它不会让你像真实的虚构人物一样见面。它们是虚构的。然而，它可以欺骗您的潜意识，使您对这个角色的概念形成一种类似于荣格的思维形态，并与之对话。然而，您实际上是在与自己的一个方面交谈，通过您对角色的概念来表达。
