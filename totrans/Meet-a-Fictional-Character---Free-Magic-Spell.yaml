    front of you in place of the picture. Be careful not to let any of the candles
    blow out or the character will disappear. It usually lasts for about 5 minutes
    so make the most of it and have a nice chat with them.

    for example. You shouldn't avoid facts simply because it makes you sad. Yes, depending
    on the age of the person you might wish to avoid stating certain facts [telling
    a child Santa isn't real for instance] but as we grow, we should be able to hear
    difficult truths and accept them. Magick is real. You can use it to bring change
    into your life, however, it has to be natural change because, on the physical,
    that's how magick works. You could create a thoughtform designed off your favourite
    character, you could also look into astral projection and see if you can create
    a fictional character on the astral. Unfortunately, the physical has more rules
    and limitations.

    as if they are real. They're fictional. However, it could trick your subconscious
    into creating your own perception of that character as a sort of thought form
    -- think something Jungian here -- and you can have a conversation. However, you
    would be speaking with an aspect of yourself, expressed through your concept of
    the character.
