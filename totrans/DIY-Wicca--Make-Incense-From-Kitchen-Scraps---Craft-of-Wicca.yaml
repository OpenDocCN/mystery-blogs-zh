    over the past 100 years, people have figured out really great techniques and materials.

    work and be closer to its origins.

    the classic route of mortar and pestle or modern with a blender or food processor
    or even just mash it with your hands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you have none of these things, do not despair. Take a bowl and use an
    ordinary rock for the pestle. (Make sure the bowl isn’t of a material that will
    break or scratch from the rock).

    will be fine, but some herbs will smoke more than scent. Have fun figuring this
    stuff out. It’s all part of the process of improving your DIY witch abilities.

    blood or something fancy, you could turn it into incense with this method.

  prefs: []

    use any old stick. The wood of an incense stick is made specially to work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    have those on hand for making candles (or remove one from a candle you have).

- en: We’re going to make free-standing incense cones. These often use makko powder
    or specially prepared combustible powders for the burning agent. But I’m guessing
    you don’t have that on hand.
  prefs: []

- en: Remember, the point is to burn, and I’ll bet you have a lot of things that burn
    in, and around, your house.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main thing to watch out for are things that are too smoky. It’s tempting
    to just grind up leaves for this purpose, and this *will* work, but it might not
    be the effect you’re looking for with incense.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a way to turn pine into wood chips small enough to grind with a
    food processor, this would be a great source for burning. Or, if you know someone
    that works with wood, sawdust is ideal for this!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The easiest method I’ve come up with is paper! Do not use newspaper or anything
    with ink on it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can make a “stick” of incense by rolling the incense in the paper (tape
    the bottom, not the part that you light at the top). The paper will burn around
    the combination, making sure it all burns evenly and slowly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you can also cut the paper and then grind it into the mixture for the cone.
    A spice grinder works great for this if you have one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could even soak the paper in a tiny amount of water and use a blender to
    get a cream that will burn when it dries.

    so far. You can try adding some water and mixing what you have into a dough and
    shaping it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it holds its shape when it dries, you’re good to go! This will probably work
    90% of the time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For other combinations, we’ll need something that is water soluble. Traditionally,
    saltpeter is used for the binding agent, but I’m guessing you don’t have that
    on hand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing I’ve used in the past is a dab of honey or syrup or molasses. Anything
    sticky will work, but this will change the scent. So maybe you don’t want to use
    that.

    how it burns, and I **do not** recommend it. If you got with these, use as little
    as possible.

    with the material, that will probably be enough.

    if you add too little, it won’t come together.
  prefs: []

    more. Knead it like dough, but you don’t need to do this too much.

    best. The narrower you can make the base, the better. The cone will probably go
    out before it all burns if the base is too large.
