 Damara, Playful One

I Call to You on this Summer’s Night

Help me rekindle my inner Joy –

The spark within me that lights up

Like a child discovering a new toy.

Help me look upon the world with wonder

And appreciate all that I take for granted,

Most of all, myself.

Thank you, Damara!

A chant alone will not work, but saying this before doing inner child work will. I would also suggest working with Damara before invoking her and have some type of offering of thanks for her.
