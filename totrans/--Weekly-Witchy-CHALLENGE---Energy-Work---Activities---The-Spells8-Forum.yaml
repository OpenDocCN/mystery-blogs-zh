    “energy work” or not, it’s unquestionable the emotional toll of our experiences
    through life as negative energy. This is totally a normal thing, of course and
    everyone copes with baggage differently, but to be honest, most people can benefit
    from doing a little grounding work to get more energetically balanced place when
    emotions are becoming overwhelming.*'

    that leaves you wound up, disconnected and internally screaming. While there are
    many ways to go about grounding yourself, each involves the act of participating
    in healing energy exchange with the earth.*'

    on about?” and for that I wouldn’t blame you. I know it sounds very woo-woo, the
    kind of thing that a caftan-clad woman with a bra loaded full of crystals would
    say casually before proclaiming your toxic trait is “having a Scorpio moon” (as
    I shake an amethyst out of my bra), but I promise you that even the hardest skeptics
    among us can’t refute the fact that there is literally no downside to engaging
    in an exercise that calls upon us to stand in the woods, put our feet in the grass,
    stop breathe, and just pause.*'

    and my own life shifted dramatically from simply taking 5-10 minutes every night
    to sit in the grass alone and ground myself. Although this technique is used in
    witchcraft pre- and post-ritual work, or during those times you are positively
    brimming with internal chaos, I’ve also found it to be an immensely gratifying
    way to cap off any day.*'

    hard for the things we have, and endlessly barraged with bad news makes us feel
    equal parts helpless and hopeless. For the most part, our modern society is completely
    separated from the natural world, set up in a way that makes it hard for people
    to even find the time to get off the hamster wheel of infinite responsibility
    and escape into natural spaces. All of this just sucks us further into the loop
    of disconnection and anxiety, which then fuels the shitty feelings that many of
    us experience on a daily basis.*'

    on perfecting your grounding game is an exercise that is well worth your time
    and energy. In the end, when life gets challenging, just take a deep breath, stretch
    out your arms, and then curl up on the ground and desperately beg the earth to
    reclaim you!*'

- en: I’m sorry to share so much from the one book, originally I had wanted to keep
    it short and sweet but I just loved reading her work. She kinda talks just like
    I do a little at times so I really connected with it all and I just wanted to
    share it cause I thought it was just brilliant. Reading and sharing this has really
    made me realise that I need to work on taking just 5 minutes for myself every
    day and practice my grounding technique.
