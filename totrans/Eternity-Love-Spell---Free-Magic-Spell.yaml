    placing it in your pocket until you are totally done cleaning everything up. 
    Store your staff and athame back where you normally keep them.  Take the ten white
    candles and store them.  Place the stones in a leather pouch and store them wrapped within
    your silken cloth (optional on being inside cloth).  Any leftover paper, do with
    what you will.  Store the pen.  After the incense has burned out, store the incense
    holder where you normally do.  Store the matches, and get rid of any left over
    tree sap or glue.  Store or get rid of the nail/sharp object.  Go cleanup your
    hand with the cut[s] now.  If done at night, go get some sleep.

    line mentioned near the beginning of the directions.  Also remember that this
    is an  ADVANCED spell, meaning that it requires time, patience, and focus; by
    attempting this spell, you are agreeing that you are well adept enough to attempt
    the use of unstable magicks and powerful spiritual  forces.  It helps if you are
