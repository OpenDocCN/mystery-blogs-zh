- en: Are you looking for new love? Do you need a hint as to who your lover might
    be? Here’s a quick and simple spell you should consider. For the spell you need
    an apple and a bolline. It is a quick ritual where you will invoke the elements
    when standing in front of the altar and repeating the following words.

    you should peel the apple while keeping it in one piece. Hold the peel in your
    right hand and say ‘spirits of love, spirits of good, on you now I beg to intrude.
    With this token to discover, the initial of my own true lover and let it be done
    that it harm no one’.

    drop the peel from your left shoulder. When it falls to the ground, it should
    suggest a letter which is the first initial of your soon-to-be lover. Next, you
    should thank the elements by saying ‘fire, earth, air, water, I thank you for
    your presence here.’ The first person to visit home after the spell will have
    the same initials as your soon-to-be lover.
