# A Spell For Banishing Poverty - Learning Witchcraft

> 来源：[https://learningwitchcraft.com/a-spell-for-banishing-poverty/#0001-01-01](https://learningwitchcraft.com/a-spell-for-banishing-poverty/#0001-01-01)

Use this spell to say farewell to poverty. The spell is popular with spell weavers living in the southern United States as well as the Caribbean.

**You will need to have the following:**

An open safety pin
Rice
Sugar
Salt
Small bowl

Fill up your bowl with equal amounts of rice, salt and sugar. Place the open safety pin in the center of the bowl. Use your own words as you are doing this to ask the deities or elements that you believe in to make sure you always have a roof over your head, money inside your pocket and food in your belly, for as long as you live.

If you happen to have a garden, place the bowl in an area that is sheltered. Or if you live in an apartment it can be placed on top of a sheltered window ledge. Once the contents inside of the bowl have gathered dust, you can replace them with suitable consecrated ones as needed.
