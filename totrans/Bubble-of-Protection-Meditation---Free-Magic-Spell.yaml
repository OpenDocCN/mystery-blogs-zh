    flow into the earth. Feel calm and peaceful. You are completely relaxed. Now visualize
    a beautiful white light all around you, like a bubble. It shimmers and sparkles.
    Now make it stronger, and then make it shine brighter. Make it grow until it fills
    the room you are in. Fill the bubble with love. Know that it will protect you
    where ever you go.
