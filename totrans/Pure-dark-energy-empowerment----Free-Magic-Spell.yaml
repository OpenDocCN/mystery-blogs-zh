- en: I would try explaining and expanding on the symbolic nature of how these elements
    used in the spell empower the caster. Also expand on what the incantations represents
    at least. If you do not understand the words you speak, your intentions will not
    come out as clear.

- en: I agree to this...Also, I recommend members of this website not to blindly trust
    just any spell they find and get their hands on, not all people can always be
    trusted. My grandmother for example, told me a story of how she tried what was
    was supposed to be a good luck spell....Her father and mother died, not much more
    than 3 days later, and of unknown cause.
