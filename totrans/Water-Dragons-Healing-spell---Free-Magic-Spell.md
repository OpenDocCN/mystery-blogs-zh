calling on a water Dragon for healing can work, but this chant seems a bit nervous? i would instead say ''oh Water Dragon hear my cry, lend me your healing chi. Let it flow and heal me. May I heal at your wish, so mote it be'' it has a bit more confidence to it, because if you are asking a Dragon for help, one would assume you already work with them, and therefore they know you don't intend to abuse their gifts.

''Slowly heal faster'' is a bit of an oxymoron, but a slight increase in the time it takes to heal is plausible with Magik. This spell walks a fine line for me. You cannot gain dragon powers. You also cannot gain elemental powers. But, calling on a spiritual entity in your craft is real. So, asking a water dragon to assist in a healing is plausible. I would edit the chant and charge the water with Magikal energy while imagining the outcome.

The premise behind this is simple, but can be effective. A couple thoughts;

Add a pinch or three of salt as you chant. Salt helps water remove infection, though to gain that benefit you would need to add a fairly large amount for the volume of water in a bathtub. However in this case adding salt can tie the body of water with the ocean and its depths.

As far as the chant itself goes, it has some flexibility, as Nekoshema already mentioned. As long as you present yourself to the dragons as a person asking for help, and recognizing their position. It could be something as simple as ''Great dragons of the depths, honor me with your healing waters.'' Approach with a sense of gratitude, and the chant that works for you should come naturally.
