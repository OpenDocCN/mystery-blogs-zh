    so many things! Ultimately, you’re very malleable based on what the people around
    you want and think, so it’s hard to pin down exactly how you appear.
  prefs: []

    also a tough placement because you struggle to live in reality.
  prefs: []

    (which can also be terrifying) through drugs, alcohol, or other addictions. With
    Neptune conjunct Ascendant, you’re more susceptible to these types of things than
    most because you want to get away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you *can* create them.
  prefs: []

    You are intuitive and empathetic, but this can be hard to handle when you are
    faced with a tragedy or violent act. Things that don’t directly affect you *do*
    influence your mental state and energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    spiritual entities.
  prefs: []

    others to see your intuition and dreamy vibe in your outer personality.
  prefs: []

    when you discover new things, regardless of your physical age. As a person, you’re

    Neptune trine Ascendant aspect like it may with the opposition or the square.
    Others feel pleasant feelings around you.
  prefs: []

    realm or mythology/fantasy.

    creative outlet is often helpful. This is one way that people *can* come to know
    who you are and see the true *you*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you have to push yourself to do.

    true to yourself.
  prefs: []

    of relationships.
  prefs: []

    in reality, so you’re dealing with a duality.
