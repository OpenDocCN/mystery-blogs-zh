    situations and even our personal thoughts. Negative energy is able to attach onto
    us, blocking our flow, this can cause us to become irritated, it can bring us
    down and drain our vitality. It is important to check ourselves and make sure
    that this is not affecting us too much. There are many ways in which we can remain
    balanced and restore our energy flow, for example exercising, eating well, spending
    time in nature and meditation, there are however times in which we need a bit
    more assistance.
