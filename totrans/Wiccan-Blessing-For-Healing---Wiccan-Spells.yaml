    as well as by working with elemental forces such as earth, air, fire, and water.
    By incorporating these elements into their healing blessings, Wiccans seek to
    harness the healing energy that flows through the natural world.

    amplify their intentions. These tools often include candles, crystals, herbs,
    and sacred oils, among others. Each of these tools is believed to have its own

    store, and emit energy, making them powerful allies in healing work. By incorporating
