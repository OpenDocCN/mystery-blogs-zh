    and vegetables. It can also be a place to store tools and supplies, or to perform
    rituals.

    rituals. It can provide healing plants to cure small problems naturally. The garden
    can also grow produce that can be used in kitchen spells. A witch’s garden is
    a great tool that can heal, protect, and provide for you magically and physically.

    a Wiccan garden. This can be confusing if you’ve never done it before.
  prefs: []

    the cheapest and most convenient because you can just order seed packets online.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you start from seed, I highly recommend sprouting them first. Planting a
    seed directly in the ground will work (it’s probably what the packet says to do).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this can take six weeks or more to see something come up. Then you should
    cull the plants. You’ll put in more seeds than you want since they won’t all germinate.
    And then they’ll crowd each other if you don’t pull out the excess ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you sprout the seeds first, they’ll come up within a few days, and you can
    space them properly the first time. This is because the sprouted seeds are the
    ones that germinated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is so much simpler than it sounds!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just space the seeds out about an inch apart on a moist paper towel. Carefully
    roll it up and put it in an unsealed plastic bag.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Check every day for mold. If they all seem to get moldy, your paper towel is
    too wet. It should be minimal dampness. Throw out moldy ones and make sure they
    stay damp.

    is correct.
