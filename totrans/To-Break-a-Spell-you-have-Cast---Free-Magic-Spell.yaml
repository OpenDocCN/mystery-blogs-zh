- en: There are times when we have cast a spell that we should not have done, either
    because we have not thought it through or because we have reacted in anger and
    later realize that it was inappropriate. Then we are honour bound to undo it.
    This spell is representational and the best time to do this is after midnight
    at the time of the Waning Moon.

    the first spell, what it has caused and why you wish it removed. Then say: "Great

    fear. It is done". You should find that you have got rid of any negativity you
    may have felt. Insofar as you have given up something which belongs to you, you
    have cleared yourself of the law of cause and effect and of any spiritual difficulty
    as a result of your initial action.'
