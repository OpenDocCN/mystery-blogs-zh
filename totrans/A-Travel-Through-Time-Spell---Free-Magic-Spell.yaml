    and experience, which spells here on this site actually work? Or which spells
    generally can we cast to actually change the physical realm?

- en: If you wish to narrow them down to categories, love, health, spiritual, wealth,
    luck and life would have the highest chance of containing working spells. Magik
    is an energy, it charges the energy around you to attract the desired change into
    your life. You will still need to work for your goal, but spells make them easier
    to obtain. If you are interested in time travel, consider past life regression.
    This would be a spiritual journey, not a physical one, and within the realm of
    possibility. If you are interested in shaping the physical to your will, that
    is rather difficult. The physical has ridged rules in place. Weather spells might
    be your best bet, though the energy required to do anything means you need to
    work your way up to weather magik. Some people are naturally talented in these
    spells. Regardless, I would avoid messing with weather as it is a delicate balance
    you should not overturn.
