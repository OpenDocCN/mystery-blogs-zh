# Djinn Summoning - Free Magic Spell

> 来源：[https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/conjuring_spells/8082/page.html#0001-01-01](https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/conjuring_spells/8082/page.html#0001-01-01)

 First, you need to set up the area you wish to perform the spell. You should be in a perfectly quiet room, where you can be alone during the duration of the spell, and stay relaxed. You need to have your mirror, lipstick, and personal item nearby, and the candles need to be set up in a straight line on the floor, about 6 inches from one another, in the order: white, red, black.

Now, to begin the spell, you must say the following words 3 times (I will include pronunciation in parenthesis).

Allah (ah-lah) shafim (sha-feem) barat (buh-rot) shiu (shoe) kamir (kuh-meer).

This incantation is used to open the gates to the world of the Djinn.

After you have said the incantation, light your candles, in the order, white, black, red (the white and black candles represent the free will of the Djinn, while the red candle, as well as the flame that rests upon it, represents the fire which gave birth to the Djinn).

Now, here is where you will choose the specific type of Djinn you wish to summon. Choose what you want, and, with the black lipstick, write the words as neatly as possible, towards the center of the mirror. Please note that you MUST, choose either male or female, and you must choose the type of Djinn. You cant leave it blank.
First, no matter what youre choosing, write:
Ali Allah hamal Jinni

Then, for the sex, after the word Jinni, write:
Muschna (for male), or vamir (for female).

Now, after the sex is written, write the following, no matter what type of Djinn you choose.
al aman.

Now, write the word for the type of Djinn you wish to choose after the period after aman.

*For a Marid Djinn (most powerful, friendly, water element), write-
Majirr Al-Amari

*For an Ifrit (Efrit) Djinn (malicious, second most powerful, fire element), write
Flamarr Al-Amari

*For a Guhl (shapeshifting), write
Sul Al-Amari

*And for a Sila (the weakest of the Djinn, however, recommended if you are a beginner), write
Shamal Al-Amari

Then, after the type of Djinn, write the following:
Closun ontei.

Now, you may feel the Djinns presence in the room with you. If you dont dont worry, as many people dont unless they are familiar with the energies a Djinn puts off.

Now, you must request that the Djinn be bound to your item (ring, pendant, etc.) in exchange for some of your psychic energy (Djinn feed off of psychic energies, but it must be offered to them, so the Djinn will gladly accept your offer.

To do this, say I wish you to be physically and spiritually bound to this ____ (name of item) presented to you here. You dont have to do anything special with the itemjust make sure its near your casting area, so the Djinn doesnt enter into the wrong item. Then say In exchange for your mortal services, I offer you a certain amount of my own energies.

Then, you must perform a short (1 or 2 minutes) meditation, during which, you will concentrate as hard as you can on transferring your energy from your body, and into the item you wish to bind the Djinn to. After youve finished your meditation, and transferred some of your energy into the item, the Djinn should be bound the item. Now, to close the spell, say the following 3 times:

En (in) tien (tea-in) Allah (ah-lah) cluman (clue-mon).

After you have said the recitation, blow out the red candle, then the black, and then the white.

Wipe off the lipstick from the mirror, as the spell is now completed.

Also, as a special bonus, I am going to include some tips on beginning communications with your Djinn. However, these tips are not originally mine, and I am passing them to you by permission of another Djinn conjurer, who wishes to remain anonymous. Here they are:

Since your Djinn is new to you, there is very little chance it will appear as a physical manifestation until it gains your trust. If you wish to ask it a question, however, there are ways that most Djinn prefer to answer you.

If you wish to ask it a question, before it gets used to you, and will answer you with audible sound, do this: Take a pencil in your weakest hand, and place it on the first line of an empty piece of paper. Ask the question outloud, in the presence of the Djinn, and command the Djinn to guide your hand and lead your to answers. Then, close your eyes, and begin moving the pencil slowly in random patterns, just doing whatever feels right, without thinking about what youre writing, until the paper is covered. Then, open your eyes, and examine the paper. Many times you will find that (if your Djinn isnt too stubborn), it will have guided your hand to write out the answer to your questions within the paper. Just look for words scattered among the random marks.

Another way, and a way the Djinn prefer to communicate with their masters, is through the dream world. To communicate this way, simply have the Djinn close to you, and, right before you go to bed, do a 10 or 15 minute meditation on the question you would like the Djinn to answer. Then, go to sleep immediately after. Youll find that the Djinn will appear in your dreams, in one form or another, and will help to advise and guide you. You will find these techniques very useful for asking the Djinn information about itself, such as its name, and if it is ready to start granting your wishes, etc.
