 Build a cairn, a small pyramid of stones. This summons hermes/mercury. Write a brief explanation of what functions you want the ring to serve. Place the paper on the top of the stones and the ring on top of the paper. Dedicate a green candle to mercury and request his blessings and assistance. Once the candle has burned down pay attention to the conversations around you when you’ve overheard a stranger or child utter something affirmative like "go ahead" or "the times right" you will know the ring has been activated.
