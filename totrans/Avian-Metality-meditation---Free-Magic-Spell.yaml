    or make you an avian. It gives you a good mindset to be an avian. You won't see
    your results because they are not phisical.

- en: To start rest for at least 5 minutes or until your mind is clear. You will need
    to be quiet and patient for this. Sit down in a quiet room with no distractions
    and get comfortable. Close your eyes. Picture yourself above the world playing
    with birds free. Picture yourself growing and using your wings. Be realistic about
    these wings. Don't think about anything unnatural like pink fairy wings but rather
    something realistic. As you picture yourself flying, think about how they feel.
    What kind of wings are they? Falcon? Hawk? Robin? The list goes on but what's
    important is that you know all about them. Once you do this, picture the wind
    in your face, making your eyes water. They in your mind, don't stop the wind but
    make yourself resistant to it. Again picture yourself flying and acting as if
    you were meant to have wings. Do and repeat this for a long time. Then you should
    let your mind go blank and think about nothing, open your eyes. There is your
    meditation. Remember this is still in testing and it won't give you wings but
    give you an avian mindset so don't comment about that. Peace out!

    what the point of this is. It says you are giving you the mindset to have wings,
    but you cannot grow physical wings, so is it a mental shift or an astral one?
    It appears harmless enough, so if someone wishes to try it themselves, go for
    it, but I do not think it will do much of anything.'
