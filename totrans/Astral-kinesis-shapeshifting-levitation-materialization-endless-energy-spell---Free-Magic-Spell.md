No form of kinesis has ever been shown to be actually possible...as the author says. On the astral plane you can do many things impossible on the physical. You don't require a spell or ingredients to perform things on the astral.

As the author said, any form of physical kinesis is not possible. As for astral, it is possible. You can use herbs, crystals, candles and other tools to aid you in astral projection and well as achieving your goals, such as growing wings on the astral or shapeshifting on the astral. However, they are not necessary as Lark mentioned. These items are used like training wheels on a bike to help you if you are struggling, but with practice, you can project and shape the astral without the aid of any physical items.
