    if it is right for your own practice or study.

- en: If you somehow aren’t aware, Lotus Tarot is one of the oldest tarot sites on
    the web. As far as I’m aware, they are the only site that offers [genuinely free
    readings](https://www.free-tarot-reading.net/ap/8201) with no strings attached.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Their commitment to this principle is admirable as many people can’t afford
    professional services at the prices they are sometimes set at.

    their deck.

- en: The Lotus Tarot Deck was designed with very specific intention by the graphic
    designer Angie (presumably in conjunction with other people at Lotus Tarot).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The intention is for ease of use and reading by taking the classic approach
    of the Rider Waite Smith tarot deck but drawing out the symbols.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of hidden information and abstract drawings, the Lotus deck uses photo-realistic
    art. Everything is shown in the foreground clearly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since many people going to their site are probably not well-versed in reading
    tarot themselves, this type of deck is ideal. As the person goes through their
    reading, they will easily see where it is coming from on the cards.

    look at the Ace of Cups, for instance.

- en: My goodness is it beautiful. My heart just sings looking at this card. And that’s
    what should happen! This card often has to do with love. The trail of lily pads
    into the distance reminds us we’re at the beginning of something.

    with the card.

    for you. With that in mind, consider the classic Rider Waite Smith version in
    comparison to the Lotus Tarot cards:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The symbols are all very much the same, but the Lotus Tarot version tweaks the
    clarity up a bit. Everything about the card points to the meaning. I love both
    versions.

- en: Now, if I’m being honest, the photo-realism doesn’t always sit as well with
    me as the Ace of Cups example did.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s hard to articulate exactly when and why this happens. I think it’s when
    there are too many elements on the card, like The Magician. A drawing blends all
    these elements with a consistent style.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you see something of a realistic style but the whole image is distinctly
    unreal, there is a clash of consistency for me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I used the cards, this initial reaction went away a bit. But it is something
    to know about the deck if you’re considering getting it. The fantastical or drawn
    elements can make for a strange meshing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to find the quality is barely better than a sheet of paper. There goes any hope
    of using it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, the team at Lotus Tarot has taken quality seriously. These are
    people in the business, and their primary concern is to make something for other
    actual tarot readers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I feel old for saying this, but this is the quality we used to get back when
    I started reading tarot twenty years ago (I had to go to an actual store, can
    you imagine?).

    yet sturdy and the finish is beautiful linen.

- en: Beginners will get clarity from this deck that is hard to find elsewhere. This
    will probably become my most recommended deck for the process of learning the
    meanings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    reading, and sturdy enough to last after dozens of readings a day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This deck is a rare gem that satisfies all of these conditions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most people looking for a tarot deck are probably not in either of these categories,
    though. They fall into what might be considered the “hobbyist.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are there. Try some of the free readings and see how much it speaks to you.

    has so many good options. The Lotus Tarot Deck fills that classical role in a
    way that pretty much no other competitor does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s easy to use and of high quality. No one who decides to switch over to Lotus
    tarot cards will be disappointed with them.
