# Tibetan Buddhist Gau Love

This is from a website I found and I have used this spell before with someone else and it's seemed to work thus far

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Beeswax candle with a love-drawing type anointing oil, such as Love Me

*   Love-drawing type incense powder

*   Lodestones (grit sized)

*   Magnetic sand

*   Add one hair from each lover

## Casting Instructions for 'Tibetan Buddhist Gau Love'

 Dress a beeswax candle with a love-drawing type anointing oil, such as Love Me (for greater passion and committment) or Come to Me (to attract new love). Light the candle and then also light a love-drawing type incense powder, such as Love Me or Come to Me. (You need a pure beeswax candle for this spell rather than a parafin offertory candle, votive candle, or glass-encased candle because you will use some of the wax in making the amulet, and beeswax is easily warmed, softened, and moulded by hand; in addition, bees and their honey are associated with the sweetness of love.)

Name two tiny lodestones (grit sized) in the names of each of the lovers. Feed them with a pinch of magnetic sand and then cover them with one pinch each of a love-drawing type sachet powder and a love herb. (For instance, you could use Love Me Powder and two dried Rose Petals or Follow Me Boy Powder and Damiana herb.)

To all of the above items add one hair from each lover (it can be a head, armpit, body, or pubic hair, but pubic hair is the most powerful) plus, if you can get them, some bodily concerns such as semen, menstrual blood, or vaginal fluid from each lover. If you are trying to attract a new lover and cannot yet obtain hairs or more intimate items from both parties, then make a substitute: On a small piece of paper inscribe both lovers' full names in a circle, in continuous form -- that is, without lifting your pen from the paper, joining the names end-to-end. Draw a small heart around the names-circle, enclosing it. Written names will not be nearly as powerful as hair and personal concerns, of course, so the latter should always be used instead, if available.

To keep the lodestones, magnetic sand, sachet powder, and other small items together and prevent their rattling around or sifting out of the Gau, embed them all in softened beeswax taken from the burning candle. Tightly pack the Gau case with the resultant beeswaxed mass, which you can keep soft and workable by warming it gently over the candle flame as you mould it to fill the interior space.

When the amulet is completed and sealed, smoke it in the fumes from the burning incense powder as you speak aloud your sincere desire or prayer in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the saint or deity of your choice. If your beloved is a woman, you can empower the spell further by reciting The Song of Solomon from the Bible as you smoke the Gau.

Interesting spell, and it might work for some, but there are a few questionable points. Why is a Buddhist casting a spell? Why would said Buddhist spell include Christian beliefs?
