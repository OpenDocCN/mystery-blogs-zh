- en: Dianic Wicca is a witchcraft tradition that celebrates feminine power and deity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dianic Wiccans focus on the Goddess, the divine feminine, and see the God as
    her consort or son. Some people who identify as Dianic also honor male gods, but
    these are generally seen as aspects of the Goddess rather than separate deities.

- en: Dianic Wiccans see the cycle of the moon as a metaphor for the cycle of life,
    death, and rebirth. They often gather in circles (both physical and virtual) to
    celebrate the moon’s phases and to work magic together.

    States in the 1970s by Zsuzsanna Budapest. Other traditions draw from traditional
    British Wicca, folk magic, Roman goddesses, and more.

    in the world and that she represents compassion, growth, and change.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key tenets of Dianic Wicca is that we pledge to do no harm. This
    means that we always act with the utmost respect for all life, and never take
    actions that could hurt others – either physically or emotionally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to this, we also believe in the Threefold Law, which states that
    whatever we do comes back to us threefold. This means that we should always think
    about the consequences of our actions before taking them and be sure that we’re
    doing what’s best for everyone involved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are rumors that some Dianic traditions do away with these laws and allow
    curses and hexes, but I would personally steer clear of these. Whether you think
    these are ethical or not, the Threefold Law doesn’t cease to exist just because
    you want it to. You will eventually pay the price.
