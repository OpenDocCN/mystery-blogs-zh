 **Introduction**

**First of all, the ward needs to be created in steps, not together. The foundation for the wards come from the ward stones (I'll be teaching you how to make them of course) and will be recharged using the celestial light. The steps are to ensure that in case during the process a fault occurs, it can be quickly corrected instead of knowing about it once it's set in stone (Don't mind the pun)**

**Step one- Crafting**

**Buy some tourmaline stones, selenite stones, etching tools and a crystal bowl (preferred is crystal glass works too), they are easy to acquire and serve as good material for etching, provided you don't break them accidentally of course. Now if its crystal, take the etching tool and use it to carve the rune "Sowilo*from elder futhark*"  inside the bowl, at the bottom of the bowl. Now once that is done, etch four runes along the rim of the bowl. Towards the east etch "Dagaz", towards the west etch "Laguz", towards the North etch "Eihwaz" and to the south etch "jera". Sowilo portrays cleansing and power, Dagaz signifies breakthrough, the light of the sun, laguz signifies the power of renewal and the underworld, Eihwaz signifies Strength, reliability and protection, jera signifies overcoming stagnation and success.**

**Once the bowl has been etched, leave it to bathe under the light of a full moon, the light of dusk and the light of dawn. leave the bowl in the evening so that the last rays of the sun shine over it, then the light of the full moon, the stars and then the light of dawn, completing an entire cycle.**

**You need to do it for three months, during the time in-between, cover the bowl in silk and keep it stored. Don't let dust to accumulate or else the process will need to be repeated. Preferred time is that of May, June and July and november, december and january. Before placing the bowl and picking it up, channel some of your energy into the bowl until you feel the bowl is "filled" with your energy.**

**During the cleansing cycle, the energy will be absorbed into the runes and any negative energy produced will be gently washed away by the light of the sun, the stars and the moon. The etching tools should also be cleansed in the same manner, although on each tool the rune the runes "Othala, Kenaz and Uruz" should be carved in the same exact order.**

**Step two- Cleansing the stones and mirror:**

**The process is split into three tiers, they are as follows.**

**Part 1:**

**On the fourth month, preferably August or February, during the day (on the day of the full moon), pour water into the crystal bowl. The level of the water should touch the runes until it touches the middle of the runes. Half of the carved runes should be submerged in water, the other half above it. Wash the tourmaline gently in the water, this is to wash of any dirt and any spiritual impurities. As you wash each piece, channel your energy into the crystal and spiritually cleanse any impurities it has. Once the pieces are cleaned, with each piece being cleaned carve the given runes in the exact same order**

**Piece 1 = Othala, Berkano, Algiz**

**Piece 2 = Othala, Eihwaz, Algiz**

**Piece 3 = Othala, Kenaz, Algiz**

**Piece 4 = Othala, Uruz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 5 = Othala, Ingwaz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 6 = Othala, sowilo, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 7 = Othala, Dagaz, Algiz**

**Once this is done, drain the water out of the bowl and pour it into another bowl. this signifies the cleansing being done and the water becoming pure again.**

**Part 2:**

**The step two is the cleansing of the selenite crystals. To do that once the sun goes down, wait till midnight on a full moon night.**

**Pour water into the crystal bowl. The level of the water should touch the runes until it touches the middle of the runes. Half of the carved runes should be submerged in water, the other half above it. Wash the Selenite gently in the water, this is to wash of any dirt and any spiritual impurities. As you wash each piece, channel your energy into the crystal and spiritually cleanse any impurities it has. Once the pieces are cleaned, with each piece being cleaned carve the given runes in the exact same order**

**Piece 1 and 8  = Othala, Berkano, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 2 and 9 = Othala, Eihwaz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 3 and 10  = Othala, Kenaz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 4 and 11  = Othala, Uruz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 5 and 12 = Othala, Ingwaz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 6 and 13 = Othala, sowilo, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 7 and 14 = Othala, Dagaz, Algiz**

**Once this is done, drain the water out of the bowl and pour it into another bowl. this signifies the cleansing being done and the water becoming pure again.**

**Part 3:**

**The mirrors are the most complex yet the most easy part of the scheme. Most of you would be wondering? "this guy is insane" or "the duck we need these for?" well we have reached here. The mirrors are acting as focus for the light itself. Sunlight, moonlight, starlight, all of these will be reflected in the mirrors and reflected towards the crystals themselves. the mirrors are to be created in two parts, the set of day and the set of night.**

**Set of day:**

**On the fourth month, preferably August or February, during the day (on the day of the full moon), pour water into the crystal bowl. The level of the water should touch the runes until it touches the middle of the runes. Half of the carved runes should be submerged in water, the other half above it. Wash three of the mirrors gently in the water, this is to wash of any dirt and any spiritual impurities. As you wash each piece, channel your energy into the mirror and spiritually cleanse any impurities it has. Once the pieces are cleaned, with each piece being cleaned carve the given runes on the back of the mirror in the same order:**

**Mirror 1: Berkano**

**Mirror 2: Eihwaz**

**Mirror 3: Kenaz**

**Set of night:**

**To do the cleansing, once the sun goes down, wait till midnight on a full moon night of the same day you cleansed the tourmaline.**

**Pour water into the crystal bowl. The level of the water should touch the runes until it touches the middle of the runes. Half of the carved runes should be submerged in water, the other half above it. Wash the remaining three mirrors, gently in the water, this is to wash of any dirt and any spiritual impurities. As you wash each piece, channel your energy into the mirror and spiritually cleanse any impurities it has. Once the pieces are cleaned, with each piece being cleaned carve the given runes in the exact same order on their back:**

**Mirror 5: Uruz**

**Mirror 6: Ingwaz**

**Mirror 7: Sowilo**

**The holders:**

**I would advise candlestick or gem holders or wood crafted ones for this purpose. There should be around 21 of these gem holds/candlesticks, although wood crafted ones are the best. At the base of each carve these runes:
Piece 1, 8 and 15 = Othala, Berkano, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 2, 9 and 16 = Othala, Eihwaz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 3, 10 and 17  = Othala, Kenaz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 4, 11 and 18 = Othala, Uruz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 5, 12 and 19 = Othala, Ingwaz, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 6, 13 and 20 = Othala, sowilo, Algiz**

**​​​​​​​Piece 7, 14 and 21 = Othala, Dagaz, Algiz**

**Each of them should be crafted in a way that the middle runes are on the middle of the gem holds/candlesticks/wooden holds and the other two runes should be around it. Othala on the right and algiz on the left.**

**The ward key:**

**Now some of you must be thinking, what of the mirror 4? The mirror 4 needs to be cleansed way before even the tourmaline is cleansed, at the dawn of that day. Pour water into the crystal bowl. The level of the water should touch the runes until it touches the middle of the runes. Half of the carved runes should be submerged in water, the other half above it. Wash the fourth mirror, gently in the water, this is to wash of any dirt and any spiritual impurities. Channel your energy into the mirror and spiritually cleanse any impurities it has, Ensure the mirror is cleansed as the raws of dawn first touch the water inside the bowl. Once the piece is cleaned,**

**Carve this rune on its back:**

**Mirror 4: Dagaz**

**Note:**

**After the mirrors have been cleansed, it’s advised to store them inside silk cloth by wrapping the cloth around the mirror. You can also cleanse the cloth in the same way as the mirrors were done with each piece having the runes painted in the same order (or sewn into it) but it's unneeded although advised.**

**Step 3: Creating the ward**

**It’s strongly advised that the ward be placed during the winter or summer solstice. The amount of energy in the area is enough to make this stronger initially, instead of making it grow stronger as it ages. The ward will become stronger as time passes, as it absorbs more and more light from the heavens, the ward will also grow in intensity. Some of these wards can be enough to burn higher level daemons and demons after a decade or so, so patience is the key.**

**If the ward is created during the summer solstice it’ll need to be recharged with the light of the sun. if the ward is created during the winter solstice it’ll need to be recharged with the light of the moon and stars.**

**We’ll first go over how to form the ward during the winter solstice:**

**Ward of the moon and stars:**

**Current name = Ordinem lunae et stellarum**

**Original names  = جناح القمر والنجوم, Ayın ve yıldızların koğuşu, 月と星のワード, 月亮和星星的守衛**

**Translated = Ward of the moon and stars**

**Now that the mirrors have been cleansed and the stones have been cleansed, it’s time to now create the wards. If you are creating this during the winter solstice it’s advised to start an hour before the solstice occurs so that its finished by the time the first hour of the solstice is up.**

**The tourmaline will be put inside the house but near the windows. Its advised to put three per floor and one in between (halfway between the floors). Its advised to put them near the windows that get the most light from outside (ie sunlight, moonlight (which is also accompanied by starlight)). Place each tourmaline into each of the corresponding hold (berkano in the berkano hold and so on). Behind each of these pieces, put the mirror which corresponds with this (Berkano mirror with the berkano tourmaline and berkano hold). The dagaz stone, mirror and hold should be put in between the floors as it also signifies the transition, here it’ll be from the earth to the skies. Tourmaline stones should be placed in a triangular manner.**

**This should be the formation of the stones and mirrors:**

**This should be the formation of the stones and mirrors:**

**        Ground floor**

**                                               Berkano (Stone, mirror, hold)**

**Eihwaz (Stone, mirror, hold)                                    (stone, Mirror, hold) Kenaz**

** The area between floors**

**   Dagaz(Stone, mirror, hold)**

**    The Upper floor**

**                                   Uruz(Stone, mirror, hold)**

**(Stone, mirror, hold)Ingwaz                                   Sowilo(Stone, mirror, hold)**

**Note that the Berkano should be placed in the North direction and the Sowilo should be placed in the south direction.**

**Once the Inner stones have been placed, it's now time to place the outer stones. These are the selenite stones. Just like the tourmaline these stones will be placed although unlike them, there are two tiers, the formation of the stones should be in such a place that light directly hits them and is unhindered.**

**The earthly tier:**

**The formation of the Earth stones is as follows:**

**Ground floor**

**                                             Berkano (Stone, mirror, hold)**

**Eihwaz (Stone, mirror, hold)                                    (stone, Mirror, hold) Kenaz**

** The area between floors**

**   Dagaz(Stone, mirror, hold)**

**    The ground floor**

**                                   Uruz(Stone, mirror, hold)**

**(Stone, mirror, hold)Ingwaz                                   Sowilo(Stone, mirror, hold)**

**Note that the Berkano should be placed in the North direction and the Sowilo should be placed in the south direction.**

**The celestial Tier:**

**The placement of the celestial Tier should correspond with the earthly tier, otherwise it’ll cause an influx of energies and might even do opposite of what is being done.**

**        The upper floor**

**            Berkano (Stone, mirror, hold)**

**Eihwaz (Stone, mirror, hold)                                    (stone, Mirror, hold) Kenaz**

** The area between floors**

**   Dagaz(Stone, mirror, hold)**

**    The upper floor**

**                                   Uruz(Stone, mirror, hold) **

** Ingwaz(Stone, mirror, hold)                                     Sowilo(Stone, mirror, hold)**

**Note that the Berkano should be placed in the North direction and the Sowilo should be placed in the south direction.**

**Note: Due to how the dagaz is in between the floors, its advised that the tourmaline dagaz be put in the east, the selenite dagaz should be placed in between south-east and north-east. None of them should face towards the west but still be able to catch the light of a setting sun or moon.**

**Crux:**

**Once the stones have been placed, let them charge for the duration of the winter solstice. Once that is done by next year the ward will be strong enough to block almost all human curses and hexes. It’ll also ward off the evil eye and other magic that can cause harm. Its advised to take good care of the stones and not let them degrade or collect dust so good care is needed**

**Also as each stone is placed, channel your energy into each stone so that it corresponds to your energy and yours alone. Same for the mirror and holds**

**Ward of the Sun:**

**Current name: Warda sole**

**Original names: 太陽的守衛, 太陽の区, Güneşin koğuşu, وارد الشمس.**

**Now that the mirrors have been cleansed and the stones have been cleansed, it’s time to now create the wards. If you are creating this during the summer  solstice it’s advised to start an hour before the dawn occurs so that its finished by the time the first hour of the dawn is up.**
