- en: This spell is not exactly mind control, but a spell to convince someone's mind
    to do something. It will put the idea in their head, and if it is already there,
    enhance it. No matter their opinions/preferences, this spell will change their
    mind. It can even change someone's emotions, hates, loves, sexuality, mind-set,
    etc. It cannot change something the person was born with/they have completely
    no choice with, such as a mental disease/disorder. This will start working straight
    away and may take up to a week for any specified action to be taken. This spell
    is probably dark magic.

- en: Personally, I don't believe in telepathy, so I would say no, but there are ways
    to influence people with magick [I've used it a few times] it isn't as if you
    say something and they repeat it in a monotone way. It's more you send your intention
    out, say ''notice me,'' and they may go about their day and their mind goes ''oh,
    there's Webvix, I should say hi'' this doesn't guarantee they will act on the
    influence, but over time they might.
