- en: There is a whole art in knot tying which-actually arose among the Celtic people
    and-later became an illustrative art. If you are able-to do it the reef-knot -
    beloved of scouts and-woodcrafters - is the ideal knot for this spell,-since it
    will not come undone. Tying a knot can-also be used as healing for someone else.

    which will-return to the earth and rot away you must also think of the pain or
    difficulty as dissolving.

- en: In this spell you tie your knot with the idea of binding the pain and then getting
    rid of it. This maybe a slow process if the condition is a long standing-one and
    sometimes we have to remember that there are spiritual lessons to be learned through
    sickness. Obviously the person concerned should also have medical help, so part
    of your responsibility is to ensure that this happens. Do not feel that the spell
    has failed if changes are not seen; they may be taking place at a much deeper
    level. Follow this with the witches ladder
