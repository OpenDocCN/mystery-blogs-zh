**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Parchment paper

*   1 red candle

*   Love oil

*   A drawing of a heart dripping blood

 On one of the nights of Venus, take a piece of parchment and draw a heart dripping blood onto it.  On the reverse side of the paper, write your name and the name of your lover. You can then anoint a red candle with love oil and place it directly onto the heart that you've drawn on the parchment paper. As you light the candle, chant the following three times:

> "Burn, flame, and light this love
> Bright and shiny as stars above.
> Cause love's heart to beat for me,
> Light our passion for all to see".

Let the candle burn to ten minutes before you extinguish it. Repeat the spell daily until the candle is consumed.
