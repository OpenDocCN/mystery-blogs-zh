    items for this spell:** Close your eyes. Concentrate your energy on them... you
    should be able to feel something blocking your energy from reaching your eyes.
    That is called (or what I like to call it) an optical energy block. These occur
    normally; your eyes are not originally intended for the purpose of spell casting.'

    not feel right, withdraw your energy from your eyes and try again after resting.
    When you feel the resistance coming from the energy block, will it to undo...
    you should feel less and less resistance coming from it. When you feel no resistance
    at all, concentrate with all your might on your energy going into your eyes. If
    you don't do this right away, the block will form again and all your work will
    be lost.

    never give you trouble again. If you successfully made it to this point: congratulations!
    You now have the ability to cast enhanced spells with your eyes. But be warned:
    If you use this ability for evil/to hurt someone or for selfish needs (such as
    gambling or betting or cheating), a permanent optical energy block will form,
    cutting off all controlled energy to your eyes forever, making them revert to
    their normal abilities.'

    physicals eyes. Coupled with the warning at the bottom, I am lead to believe this
    is fake, but try it and see if it helps you.
