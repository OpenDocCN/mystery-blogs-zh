- en: There are different methods of balancing the chakras. Some people use coloured
    crystals, as the energy vibrations of colours aids balancing. Essential oils can
    be used for their healing vibrations. Visualisation is powerful, as thought is
    energy. Affirmations made while chakra balancing create positive feelings. Whichever
    methods are used or combined, chakra balancing offers very positive results -
    improving your health and making you feel good about yourself.

    morning is a wonderful way to start the day, making you feel full of life, positivity
    and hope. Balancing your chakras before you go to sleep at night will calm you
    down, ease your mind and promote a wonderful night's sleep. If you want to do
    it during the day, then you must find a quiet space and time for yourself.

- en: 'Located at the base of the spine, the first energy center, sometimes called
    the root chakra, relates to our most basic survival needs and our sense of belonging,
    whether to our family or a larger group. When this chakra is clear and energy
    flows through it freely, we feel secure and confident that we can easily fulfill
    our needs. On the other hand, blockage in this area can cause us to feel anxious
    and worried. This chakra, which connects us to the earth, gives us vital information
    about whether actions we''re considering will nourish us or pose a threat. When
    we have a decision to make, we can listen to the signals of the root chakra: Uncomfortable
    sensations are a message to be alert and reconsider, while pleasant feelings indicate
    that a given course of action is likely to meet our needs for safety and nourishment.'

    birthboth literally to a new baby but also metaphorically to new aspects of ourselves,
    projects and ideas. When this chakra is healthy, we're tapped into the source
    of higher energy that helps us write beautiful music, develop an innovative business,
    or create a loving family life. When this chakra becomes congested, we may experience
    a block in our creative powers and a sense of dryness or emptiness.

- en: The third chakra, which governs our will, self-esteem and sense of personal
    power, is located in the solar plexus. When energy flows freely through this center,
    we're confident about our ability to manifest our intentions and desires. When
    the third chakra is blocked, however, we feel powerless and frustrated.

- en: This energy center is sometimes referred to as the "heart chakra because it
    resonates in the heart and relates to compassion and love. When the fourth chakra
    is flowing and open, we feel deeply connected to everyone in our life. But when
    it's obstructed, we experience loneliness and a sense of alienation.

- en: This energy center is localized in the throat area and relates to communication
    and self-expression . . . the ability to voice our dreams. When our center of
    communication is clear, we're able to express our truth without worrying about
    what others may think. In contrast, with a congested fifth chakra, we feel anxious
    about how other people will react to our views and are likely to censor ourselves.

- en: The sixth chakra, also known as the 'brow chakra' or the 'third eye' is located
    between the eyes. It's the center of insight, where we integrate all the information
    and intuition in our life. When energy isn't flowing easily through this chakra,
    we have a sense of self-doubt and distrust. When it's open and clear, we feel
    deeply connected to our inner wisdom and trust that it guides us in our choices.

    balance chakras. It states there are many methods, then gives a brief overview
    of each chakra, but does not provide the specific activities and items associated
    with balancing each chakra. Decent information, but needs an edit to deliver what
    the title promises.
