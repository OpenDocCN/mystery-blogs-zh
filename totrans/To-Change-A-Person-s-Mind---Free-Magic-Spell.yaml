    items for this spell:** Look at the person''s head. See it become clear and transparent.
    See the dust inside of it; the dust of their bad habits or ideas, the ones that
    are destructive or you want to change. Dust it out with an astral feather (a red
    one, made of flame). It singes all bad thoughts from their head. Once done, the
    head should return to being opaque. It is done, but because it is manipulation
    it should be done with care.'
