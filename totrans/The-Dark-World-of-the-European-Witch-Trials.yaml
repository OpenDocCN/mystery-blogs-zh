    The witch hunts resulted in a wide variety of executions, ranging from “hanging,
    burning at the stake, boiling in oil or water,” and being “stoned to death.”

    also met their fate when they burned at stake along with Eva for killing innocent

    that led to crop destruction, causing famine and disease outbreaks as well. Others
    have pointed to social upheaval following political changes like the Protestant
    Reformation or wars such as The Thirty Years War (which lasted from 1618-1648)
    as a cause for the hunts.

    people began to convert. With a new strategy in place that would seemingly work

    under church law.'

    so they turned to begging out on the streets and took on the profession of a healer
    to make money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During this time period women were expected to be pious housewives that stayed
    at home taking care of their children instead of working outside the home. So
    when these widows turned to begging or becoming healers they faced criticism from
    both men and women in society who considered these women to be immoral, and as
    a result they were accused of witchcraft.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This “attack” on the traditional view of what it meant to be a woman in society
    led to accusations against these widows for being witches by people who feared
    they would lose their place in the hierarchy if gender roles began changing. This
    lead many scholars to believe that the European Witch Hunts were not simply a
    religious movement but also an effort to maintain class and gender hierarchies
    in society.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    against these women for two reasons: they had become independent and taken on
    professions traditionally believed to be only male occupations; and they were
    challenging the gender roles of what it meant to be a woman in society.'

    trials, but it wasn’t necessarily the cause. It’s impossible to say how much religion
    contributed to this gender equality, however it was ultimately the social climate

    were many superstitions and beliefs that people had about witches, including but

    could be any woman, man or child. The truth was that a witch hunt often starts
    with an accusation from someone out of anger, jealousy or vengeance- not because
    there had been any evidence for their guilt.
