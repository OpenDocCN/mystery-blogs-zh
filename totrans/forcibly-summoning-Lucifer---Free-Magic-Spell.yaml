  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I highly doubt it's real. While you can call on Lucifer and work with him, you
    can't force a deity to do anything, and forcing Lucifer is just asking for trouble.
    If you wish to work with him I suggest setting up an altar, leaving and offering,
    asking to work with him, and meditating before the altar. It might take longer
    but it's more respectful and more likely to get positive results.
