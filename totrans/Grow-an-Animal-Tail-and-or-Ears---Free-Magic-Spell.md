nice spell and well written

Lunatus is correct, it is fake.

It says believe so you dont know if it is real or not

You can believe as much as you want, but belief cannot break natural laws. We cannot grow tails magickally, or develop animal ears, etc, as this breaks natural laws and alters our genetics, something that magick cannot do. Belief can only get you so far, and this spell is beyond what we can achieve.

You guys believe what you want to believe dont let others destroy your path. I believe in Magic and if you dont thats fine but dont break others spirit

nobody's ''destroying'' anyone's path. we are stating facts about magick and how it works on the physical plane. should you accept or ignore our words of wisdom is your choice. we're not chasing people down and demanding they conform, we are replying to comments, explaining how magick works, and giving alternatives to achieving your goal [regarding animal features, you cannot physically, but it's possible astrally]

Alright I mean Im connected with spiritual things and I do have spiritual claws but alright I believe u Nekoshema

You cannot grow physical ears and tail with Real Magic.

I have a question What if i want to put the spell in a shampoo? What should i do?

It still won't work, but you can enchant shampoo by charging energy while holding the bottle, letting the energy pool in the shampoo bottle while visualizing/imagining your desired outcome and/or chanting [I enchant my salt body scrubs to double as a cleansing scrub, as well as say a cleansing chant while in the shower. It's called mixing the magickal with the mundane]
