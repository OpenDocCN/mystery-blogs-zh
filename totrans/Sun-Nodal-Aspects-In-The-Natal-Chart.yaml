    that you’re evolving away from, while the North Node is the point that shows how
    the soul *wants* to grow. The North Node tends to feel more uncomfortable because
    the work is new, but the qualities of the North Node will ultimately bring you
    fulfillment.

    have Sun opposition South Node, because the Nodes always sit exactly opposite
    each other.

    one in the same. This means that your ego or your sense of willpower automatically
    supports your life’s purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the path can be hard, the goal is to truly *know* who you are by the end of your
    life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also important with Sun conjunct North Node that you learn to *express*
    your truest self fully, regardless of what others think. This is the highest manifestation
    of the ego, but it’s actually quite hard to be authentic at all times.
  prefs: []

    lifetime, so while this can be a difficult path, you’ll find that every obstacle
    in your life pushes you closer to this goal. Ultimately, you want to know yourself
    on *every* level.
  prefs: []

    age. You tend to know what you think about everything, but this is usually how
    you’re working to discover your truest inner self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Node. For example, it might be very important that you feel *seen*, and you may
    go out of your way to exert your will or achieve something.

    such as boasting, exaggeration, or acting like royalty.

    However, when you find yourself boasting or acting overconfident/selfish, this
    is a sign that you have not discovered your true sense of self *within*. Often,
    these mannerisms are a way for someone with Sun conjunct North Node to make up
    for the *lack* of self within.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    others to the point where you forgot who you truly were. With Sun conjunct North
    Node, you denied your own needs for so long that you don’t know what they are
    anymore.

    motion during a past life, you may have experienced some of these feelings in
    your childhood, too.

    others don’t like this. You need to learn that if something is *actually* true
    for you and not a manifestation of ego, then it can’t be wrong.

    father figure as a child. Maybe you didn’t have a proper father figure and felt
    that a part of you was missing, or perhaps you had a fraught relationship with
    your father that left you feeling less-than.

    other people’s opinions, but you need to push in order to break out, even if it
    feels uncomfortable. We tend to feel most uncomfortable moving towards our North
    Node because it’s unfamiliar, so Sun conjunct North Node can be a difficult placement
    because your very Sun sign feels uncomfortable!

    ego take over.

    Your Earth sign sits opposite your Sun (in every birth chart) and represents that
    qualities that the Sun is trying to push away from. Your Earth sign shows how
    you felt as a child, but these are usually negative feelings, so you want to move

    side of Pisces without the fear.
