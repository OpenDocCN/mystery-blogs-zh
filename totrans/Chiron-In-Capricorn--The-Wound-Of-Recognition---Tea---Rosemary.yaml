    recognition, but it can bleed into many areas of your life and is not just job-related.
  prefs: []

    see your wound. Every so often, you are reminded that your wound exists; this
    feels painful but is actually beneficial because this will force you to heal the
    wound.

    and being *around* other people.

    super socially conscious of what you say and how you say it, do a lot for the
    general public, work really hard in your career to try and get noticed, etc. A
    lot of this will of course depend on the house that your Chiron sits in.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many individuals develop this wound in childhood because they are never recognized
    or noticed by the adults around them. They aren’t given a voice, and their opinions
    don’t matter. They just can’t seem to catch up to everyone else.

    might have *needed* to be noticed; it was a matter of life and death. For example,
    one might have worked for a King and been put to death or shunned if the individual
    wasn’t well-liked.
