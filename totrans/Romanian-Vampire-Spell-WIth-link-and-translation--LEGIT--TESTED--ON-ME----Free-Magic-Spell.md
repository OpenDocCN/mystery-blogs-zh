I am Romanian, and the ''original'' Romanian version doesn't sound quite right. Sounds... translated?

probably is, the majority of spells with a title that's all capitols and the persons going ''totally real you guys'' is made up with little effort put in so the user sounds cool for doing the spell. if you could fix the translation that would be helpful, but this spell is fake, you cannot physically transform into a vampire, and even if you could, simply saying you're a vampire would be far too easy, so i would hate for you to waste your time fixing the translation for a broken spell.

This is fake and does not work. You cannot become a Dracula type vampire, they are astral, not physical. You are physical. Magik on the physical does not defy natural law. Ergo, all of this nonsense is fake and will not work.
