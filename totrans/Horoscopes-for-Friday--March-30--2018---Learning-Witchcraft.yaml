    in family affairs, in your career and, most of all, in issues that matter on a
    higher level. The world needs your passion and power. Give as much as you can.'

    moment you veer from the truth, even slightly, is the moment when you lose the
    debate. You don’t need to make things up – you’re on the winning side already.

    that could cost you a lot of money if they go wrong. Remember that it is not just
    your investment that is at stake but other people’s too – so err on the side of
    caution.

    of the current full moon begins to wane you may wonder why you allowed yourself
    to get so emotional. Give others the benefit of the doubt if they annoy you.

    up about it. It probably isn’t of much significance in the greater scheme of things,
    so let it pass and focus instead on what makes you happy – your friends and your
    family.

    and so long as you know which is which you won’t have any problems today. If,
    however, you get them mixed up you could end up doing everything twice.

    chart the next few days will be crucial for both your home life and your work.
    Whatever happens you must not let the pressure get to you. Stay calm and you will
    survive!

    it. Get out into the world and get involved in what’s going on in your environment.
    The more active you are the less time you will have to dwell on so-called “problems”.

    approaching full moon will bring lots of temptation. If you splash out now you
    will most likely regret it later on when you are in need of cash but don’t have
    any left.

    will say or do something that puts you at odds with other people. If it happens,
    it happens. Don’t hate yourself for it – you’ll find ways to make amends later
    on.

    do all the things you promised to do, but don’t sweat it. Do the most important
    thing first and do it well. After that, everything else should fit nicely into
    place.

    days, but don’t make an issue of it. And don’t wind them up for the fun of it
    either. There is a time and place for your offbeat brand of humor – and this isn’t
    it!

    likely it isn’t true but even if it is you will catch up with them again later
    on. Stick to the course you have chosen and give it time to bear fruit.
