    outcome with magick, a lot of times people might not know how to approach it in
    the most effective way. They might have an idea of different spells they can use,
    along with different techniques, but, quite often, it''s the right kind of preparation
    that will help someone to be successful when it comes to magickal workings.*'

- en: Now, what might some of those preparations be? Let's look at some of them more
    closely.
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, you want to have an idea about what you want to manifest. It doesn't
    necessarily need
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to be totally 100% clear, because you'll never run out of things that could
    potentially go right or wrong. Things that you might forget to think about when
    putting your working together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That being said, sometimes it can be good to not necessarily be too specific,
    because this opens you up for more possibilities when it comes to the thing you
    want to come into your life.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it has to meet incredibly specific requirements, it may take longer or may
    be more difficult to manifest when it might be possible to obtain it through simpler,
    more relaxed means.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's good to at least have a general idea of the things that make up what
    you want and to be open minded rather than **setting rigid expectations**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take as much time as you'd like for this. Write your ideas down that collectively
    make up what you want.
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And, secondly, it's good to have an openness to receive beyond what you think
    you want for yourself. To be open to allow the universe to help give you what
    you desire on a subconscious level, and deeper than what you think you desire
    on a conscious level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's possible that you have a conscious idea of what you want, but, in your
    subconscious, you already have a full and complete understanding of what would
    be best for you.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which brings us to the third preparation — **studying your dreams**. Your dreams
    will tell you everything about yourself. And your dreams will help you to solve
    problems in life that are uniquely yours. If you can understand your dreams, you
    can understand yourself on the deepest levels and this can lead to an even deeper
    and more meaningful manifestation if you're working to fulfill something on your
    deepest level of fulfillment, as opposed to something more surface level that
    seems good in theory, but may not be what you truly want at the core of who you
    are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have difficulty when it comes to analyzing dreams, a similar result can
    be achieved through introspection, such as journaling and writing about your thoughts,
    feelings, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're able to enter into a deep state of relaxation while doing this, it
    can help you access a deeper level of awareness that can help you find even more
    things about yourself, somewhere between conscious introspection and subconscious
    dreams.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This last point may seem arbitrary, but it can be very useful because you may
    try to manifest something that might come to you from the perspective of your
    blockages or a misunderstanding of what having something feels like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Allow yourself to be open to things happening naturally, and to receive what
    the universe is willing to bring you if it aligns with what you're looking for.
    Sometimes, it may not seem exactly like what you want, but it may end up aligning
    more closely with what you need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes it's best to just let the universe bring what you're ready for and
    to enjoy it.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Practice will help you understand how to manifest better, as you'll see things
    come into your life that energetically match up with your spell work. And, when
    you see these things come up, you will continue to get better at taking initiative
    in order to follow them through to their completion.

    that can be done to help manifest things. For example:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Meditation** to help clear the mind of distracting thoughts so you can fully
    focus on your desires.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Concentration**, especially on your desire to help focus the energy of your
    thoughts onto its completion.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than wanting your desire, imagine that you're experiencing already **having
    it**.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, take action to **carry it out**.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's important to follow spells with doing the physical work or taking action
    in the world or in situations related to the spell is very important because it
    increases your chances for something related to it to manifest into your life.

- en: '*Keep yourself open. Allow things to come into your life rather than forcing
    them. Use your intuition to weigh out your best options.*'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When done, thank yourself and the universe for making your manifestations come
    true, or, if they were yet to be fully realized, it's still good to show gratitude
    when there is at least some partial success because, on a subconscious level,
    it reminds you that you're moving in the right direction, and it's also a great
    way to send some positive energy back to the universe for working with you to
    help bring you what you desire into your life. Even if what you want may not be
    the best thing for you, that's how much the universe respects your desires and
    free will.
