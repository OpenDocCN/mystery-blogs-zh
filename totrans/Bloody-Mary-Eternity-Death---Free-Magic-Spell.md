Place the two gray candles and the two white candles to the right, and light them. Scatter the roses or petals around the mirror. While you do this say a chant:

"Mary, Mary, you have been buried, down down deep in the ground, for what you did, never let that stop you, never let that."

Then place the rosemary, dragon's blood, and the myriad in the front of the mirror. Place the picture of your victim(s) on top of the mirror, slowly drip the blood onto the picture. While doing so, say this spell:

"Mary, Mary, here my bloody scream, come and take this life away, you can play with it at any cost, just take this poor soul away, now Mary."

You may hear a blood curling scream, that means it's working. Just be aware, she will get what she want. Let the candles burn, leave them where you have them.
