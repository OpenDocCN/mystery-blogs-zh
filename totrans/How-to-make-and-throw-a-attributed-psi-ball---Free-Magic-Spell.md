Different visualizations can produce different types of psi balls and different effects the psi balls have on other objects. One of my favorite things to do is to make a psi ball, visualizing it as a ball of fire While that might result in a hot psi ball, visualizing a flame colored blue or a tornado of snow might produce a cold one. Have fun with this - these are just a few examples! Combine ideas as well.

Another fun thing to mess with is throwing your psi balls. I learned how to do this by, you guessed it, visualization! I would pretend to see my invisible psi ball and watch it with my eyes as it flew through the air. I was really just tracing a simple curved path in the air with my eyes, but after some practice, it did start to work. I would make a hot ball and throw it at a thermometer from across the room then watch the degrees rise. Or I would boomerang one around the room, and catch it. You'd be surprised how fun it is
