- en: The term *hedge witch* is incredibly popular right now. The hedge witch is pictured
    as the solitary shaman working alone at the edge of the forest. However, hedge
    witchcraft is an eclectic practice with so many elements.

    keep in mind that this is all based on my own practice and research.

    definitions.

    who is a Seer, Shaman, and witch all in one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically, the term hedge witch was used for anyone who lived along the fringes
    of a village, behind the hedgerows. The village was on one side of the hedges
    and the unknown, “wild” beyond was on the other side.

    life, such as in the home and hearth, but who also offered divination or healing
    services to those in need.

    crossing, hedge riding, or hedge jumping all refer to the hedge witch venturing
    into another realm while keeping one foot in the mundane world.

    the veil” is really important for most hedge witches. This can refer to astral
    travel, the Otherworld, or various other realms depending on the tradition and
    belief set the witch is working with.

    fundamental properties of the hedge witch can apply to virtually anyone from any
    culture. The hedge witch is quite eclectic in his/her practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    The magic that they practice is results-based. If something works, a hedge witch
    will repeat the process, and scrap rituals that have no practical effect.

    their practice on *practicality* rather than on ritual alone.

    is often incorporated on a daily basis in small ways.

    and the earth. There is a connection for for these witches between the earth and
    the spirit world that is fluid; they are one in the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Animism is typically popular in hedge witchcraft. The hedge witch will speak with
    the spirits of the trees, engage with critters outside, and generally form bonds
    with the earth around them. The seasons and cycles of nature are very important
    in hedge witchcraft.

    trance or by altering their consciousness in some way.

    Astral travel is very common as is experimentation with different types of hedge
    jumping, such as entering the dreams of others or various spirit realms.
  prefs: []

    interested in working as a hedge witch, ancestor communication is a great place
    to start. Ancestors are very safe spirits.

    and more. Although they’re typically solitary witches, they do tend to partner
    with many types of spirit beings.

    on the border between the city and the country, at the edge of the water between
    the ocean and the land, at a crossroads, or using the energy of both the earth
    and the sky/air. The cemetery is another border (between life and death) that
    some hedge witches utilize.

    you don’t have any plants, this may be the time to pick out an easy plant to care

    would like to be placed, how much care it wants, etc.

    the shadow self and perform rituals.
