    works, a good way to get used to this technique is to put your hand under the
    faucet of a running bath and turn the heat up and once the heat gets to be hot
    enough for you to pull away normally, leave it in and recite the chant and you
    should be able to tolerate it much easier and longer... wait by hot I mean where
    you''d flick your hand and go oww thats hot not boiling water... please have common
    sence when testing spells)'
