    are best conducted around this time of the months. But sometimes there is* ***no
    time nor the mood for an elaborate ritual*** *that includes a circle, robe, candles,
    herbs and all sorts of other tools.* In this article, we will look at **4 simple
    and non-complicated ways in which you can take advantage** of the time during
    the Full Moon to help you get the most out of it, so you’re not left wondering,
    “what should I do?” and left scrambling, trying to figure it out what to do on
    the night of the Full Moon.'

    of manifestation and completion.

- en: First of all, the energy of the Full Moon is considered most active somewhere
    between the **3 days leading up to the Full Moon**, during the time of the Full
    Moon itself, and the **3 days after the Full Moon**. This means that there is
    roughly around a week in which the energy is very powerful during this time.
  prefs: []

- en: Lunar energy itself is often considered very reflective.
  prefs:

- en: The Moon reflects the Sun’s rays like a mirror and projects it back out for
    all to be influenced by it. Therefore, it's a good time to take for **introspection
    and** [**journaling**](https://www.magickandwitchcraft.com/post/shadow-work-prompts)and
    to observe how the world acts around you during this time. You can get a journal
    and start writing down all the things you notice differently about this time during
    these days leading up to the Full Moon, during, and after, and how it makes you
    feel. *This will give you an idea of how things manifest in your life using Full
    Moon energy.*

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that you have an idea of how the energy is influencing things around you
    and within you, you can use this energy to help you finish projects. Having trouble
    finishing something? **Use the incredible energy of the Waxing Moon to help get
    you through to the end.** Transfer this extra energy into your projects, allowing
    the Full Moon to help manifest things for you by using its building energy to
    your advantage. The Full Moon is, again, a **time of completion and manifestation**,
    so you may find yourself naturally bringing things to completion even without
    realizing that it’s during the time of the Full Moon coming to completion. It
    can be a very motivating time, so take advantage of it and use that extra energy
    to help get you over the hill and overcome your obstacles like the sacred scarab.

    this energy to charge crystals during this time.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Full Moon every night leading up to the Full Moon, or, if you want, during the
    last few days before the Full Moon when the energy is most powerful.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that you've charged your crystals during this phase of the Moon getting
    full, you can **use them on the night of the Full Moon** as a symbol of completion.
    Mainly, I recommend using them on areas where you feel you may have blockages.
    You can use the introspection recommended earlier to help assess where these blockages
    may be and place the charged crystals on those areas to help allow the darkness
    to come to light and use the night of the Full Moon to serve as a **symbol of
    completion** by finally letting go of the past and filling these areas up with
    **radiating Lunar light**.
