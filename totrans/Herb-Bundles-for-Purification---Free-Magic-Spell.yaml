- en: Cut the stems of the plants so that they are all equal in length. Take the base
    of the stems and carefully tie them together with twine. Hold the stalks of the
    herbs upside down and slowly tie them together, spacing the tied portions about
    an inch apart in length. Continue wrapping the string around the length of the
    leaves until the entire bundle is wrapped in the string. Wrap the string around
    the bundle in a criss-crossing pattern. Don’t tie it too tightly, you don’t want
    to cut off portions of the leaves or stalks. You want it just tight enough that
    the plants stay snug in the bundle you’ve made.

    or two, depending on the moisture of the plant. Make sure they are stored in a
    cool, dry place with proper airflow or the bundles will mold, and you don’t want
    that.

    cleansing space for ritual and spell work.
