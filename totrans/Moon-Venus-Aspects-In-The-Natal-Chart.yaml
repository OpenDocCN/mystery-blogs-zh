    tend to use roundabout methods of getting what you want since you don’t want conflict.
  prefs: []

    you’ll be overly sympathetic or empathetic to someone in order for them to like
    and approve of you.

    After all, who *doesn’t* like someone who listens to them and adapts to their
    needs?

    a softer touch.
  prefs: []

    is in. With an air sign conjunction, you may be verbally or socially charming,
    while a water sign conjunction gives you a deeper sense of emotional empathy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Appearances may be very important for you, though the way that this manifests
    is again dependent on the sign. You may desire a beautiful or balanced home, enjoy
    artwork, or dress yourself a certain way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Venus. When something doesn’t look right, it can set your emotions off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    emotionally content.

    better when you’re emotionally distraught. Be careful that you don’t use pleasure
    as a substitute for love.

- en: Many of your Moon conjunct Venus qualities probably stem from your mother. You
    may have *seen* your mother use charm to get what she wanted or avoid problems
    and focus only on the beautiful elements of life. In this way, you would have
    learned how to behave from your mother.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    way that you desired. In this scenario, indirect tactics tended to work best,
    so you learned these Moon conjunct Venus qualities from your interactions with
    your mother.

    use your charm or persuasion to get what you want. You know how to recognize and
    respond to other people’s emotions, but with Moon conjunct Venus, you have an
    opportunity to use your qualities for good.
  prefs: []

    run, these types of relationships won’t help you.

    blocked around others. You have trouble reading the social or emotional cues of
    the people around you and may respond in ways that don’t endear you to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    You felt unloved by your parents, or simply believed that they could not fully
    understand you. This may have been especially prevalent with the mother.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, you unconsciously remember these childhood lessons and they cause social
    problems for you. The main source of your inability to socialize is most likely
    your own insecurity. Others feel this insecurity (that you desperately try to
    hide) and feel like you’re concealing something important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon opposition Venus, you come off as insincere or disgenuine. You try
    to play a part with other people and put on the face that you *think* they would
    like, so that you aren’t rejected, but this actually makes other people want to
    distance themselves from you. After all, most people can innately sense sincerity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Others may perceive you as cold, unfriendly, distant, or superficial. You tend
    to lack warmth when you’re socializing, and if you do try to show affection, it
    may seem as though you have an ulterior motive, generally due to your unbalanced
    emotions.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may even try to obtain or keep a partner through questionable means like
    manipulation, blackmail, and other tactics that have very little to do with love.
    You could experience a variety of unfulfilling relationships, repeating the same
    steps over and over, until you work on the problem within yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are out of balance. Looking to external sources will never truly fix the disharmony
    within you.
  prefs: []

    absorbed about yourself in childhood.

    affection. You struggle to be affectionate in a way that feels authentic, but
    you also have trouble *getting* affection and love from others that is emotionally
    satisfying.
  prefs: []

    success, based mainly on what the relationship *appears* to be.

    them with Moon square Venus. You might really believe that once you reach your
    Venusian goals you will feel happy. However, this never happens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are ignorant of your own emotional needs as well as those of others. When
    you’re in a group setting, you may only care about talking to the most important
    people. This won’t satisfy you emotionally, but you additionally have no qualms
    about stepping on others to get where you want to go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Moon square Venus, you may feel a chemical euphoric release in your brain
    when you achieve something Venusian. Unfortunately, this does not help you work
    through your emotions or satisfy you over the long haul.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re chasing emotional fulfillment in all of the wrong ways. Over time, you
    must learn to let go of the Venusian things and focus *inside*, on your own emotions.

    and compassion for others in a way you didn’t before.
  prefs: []

    step back and do the tough, painful work to confront your own demons and deal
    with the feelings you have repressed.
