# Exorcism: The Power of Three

The Power of Three is a natural magick force, but does not belong to any of the four cardinal elements. This force is one which makes positive energy grow, but conversely repels or destroys evil. This is the force which is responsible for the three-fold law in Wicca!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Exorcism: The Power of Three'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** The best way to invoke the Power of Three is to combine the talents of three witches with different, yet complementary powers: the first must have gifts to fight and protect, the second must have gifts to heal and soothe, and the third must be gifted with wisdom and divination powers.

Witches representing these three gifts now only need to recite an incantation, for example:

"By the Power of Three,
We put an end to this possession,
(Name of the possessed)
Is released from the demon".

This force is powerful enough to exorcise most evil spirits and demons. However, finding three witches with the above talents can be a long and complicated process.
