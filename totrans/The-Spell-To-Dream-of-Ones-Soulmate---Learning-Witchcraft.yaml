    prior to performing this spell, you may want to practice dream recall. To do this,
    a journal must be kept next to your bed. The moment you wake up, lay very still
    and try to remember your dreams, as soon as you remember them all, write them
    down. As you practice, it will become easier to recall more and more of them.'
