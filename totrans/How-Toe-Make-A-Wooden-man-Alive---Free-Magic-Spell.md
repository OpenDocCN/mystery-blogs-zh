Haha...no. That would be crazy if a being like Jesus would do something like that but not do the thousands of other things asked of him that would be a lot more simple for a basic human to do alone. Pretty sure you're not bringing a ''Wooden Man'' to life this way. Also kinda odd to want to do, don't think Jesus is gunna bring something to life just for it to be your slave or ''Toy'' or whatever.

You cannot give an inanimate object life with Real Magic.
