- en: Learning to trust your gut, especially with Libra in the 7th house, can be a
    game-changer for your decision-making process. You’re naturally inclined to consider
    everyone else’s opinions and desires, often at the expense of your own. While

- en: Trusting your gut is about tuning in to your own instincts and feelings. It’s
    that initial reaction you have to a situation, person, or choice. Sometimes this
    gut feeling is subtle, a mere whisper among the loud voices of logical reasoning
    and other people’s opinions. Other times, it’s a strong pull in a particular direction.
    Either way, it’s your subconscious giving you clues about what’s right for you,
    based on your past experiences and innate sense of self.

- en: When you consistently prioritize what other people want, you can lose touch
    with this inner compass. It’s like you’re silencing it by letting the noise from
    the outside world drown it out. To re-tune into your gut, you might need to spend
    some time alone and engage in some self-reflection. Activities like journaling,
    meditation, or even long walks can help you connect with your inner self.

- en: The next step is to practice acting on these instincts in small ways. Start
    with low-stakes decisions. How do you feel when you listen to your gut, and what’s
    the outcome? Slowly, you’ll build confidence in your own judgment and be more
    willing to trust it in higher-stakes situations.
