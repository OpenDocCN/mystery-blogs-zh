- en: Sit by the stream and cup a large sycamore leaf in both of your hands. look
    directly at the leaf and ask it a yes or no question. afterwards, keep your hands
    cupped and slowly lower the leaf into the stream and allow the water to gently
    release it from your hands. (Be sure to place the leaf "straight" into the water,
    not sideways)....if the leaf spins clockwise, the answer to your question is yes.
    If counterclockwise, the answer is no.

    clockwise, your wish will come true. If counterclockwise, your wish will not come
    true.
