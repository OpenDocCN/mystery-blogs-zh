- en: The lunar ''dragon'' is actually many beings. We refer to them as one. They
    are of the universe, they have guided us with or without this ritual. This may
    not work for anyone else, but it should give you prophetic dreams and allow you
    to lucidly contact the beings that influence us (Golden Diamond*, Tiamat, Kiazor,
    The universe herself, ect.)

- en: Set up a space in a moon-lit room. Outside can work but can be dangerous in
    most neighborhoods. Make sure when you lay that the moon will hit your entire
    body. Take the moon water and anoint a clear crystal (Tourmaline works, Ametrine
    is great, amethyst, ect.). You'll want to drink a little bit (No more than five
    drops) of the vanilla extract, burn the incense, and take the Dragon's blood oil
    and draw two Dragon-like eyes on the back of your hands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Set the crystal on your third eye and astral project. When you astral project,
    you should hear a loud roar. The moon should feel like it's drawing you in. Let
    it do so, and you should see one of the beings that make up the Lunar dragon in
    front of you. If you see one soul deity, then you are talking to all of them.
    You can ask them anything you need guidance with.

- en: The last line is odd [it sounds like a Steven Universe warning] While I've never
    heard of a ''lunar Dragon'' this could work since you're summoning an astral Dragon
    then projecting to meet with them. [it's just the last bit that makes me think
    it's fake] Try it and see if it works.

- en: Since lunar dragons are not real, and the bottom paragraph sounds ridiculous,
    I am fairly certain this is fake.

- en: I would consider the overall process to be useful as a way to call for, and
    meet with, an entity associated with the moon. Vanilla extracts can have a very
    strong, bittered-sweet taste, especially if using an artificial extract. I would
    suggest an alternative of getting an actual vanilla bean, scraping the middle,
    and placing that on the tongue. Same effect, but with a less... severe taste.

- en: It would also be helpful to have in mind what form of a dragon/draconic energy
    you want to connect with; A dragon of the moon and what it represents? (Feminine,
    protection, 'motherly', observer, wisdom, etc) Or as an archetype representing
    the primordial energy of the moon and tides. Basically, ask yourself if you are
    focusing on meeting with an active entity, or on connecting with a quality of
    energy and vibration. Both are viable, but will lead to differing results.

- en: Other stones that would be very effective; Moonstone (it's in the name), White
    opal, natural pearl, blue jade (a dream stone), celestite, or clear quartz.
