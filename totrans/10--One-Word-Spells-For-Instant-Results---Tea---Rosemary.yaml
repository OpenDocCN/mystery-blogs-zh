- en: Practicing witchcraft can feel like a lot of work. Most witchcraft spells are
    long and drawn out, and they require a decent amount of ingredients, time, and
    power.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As much as I love spending a few hours getting *really* involved in a spell,
    there’s something ultra-powerful about a spell that’s simple and quick. If you
    can focus your energy and direct enough intention during that short period of
    time, there’s a lot of potential for a fast spell to succeed.

- en: Today I’m compiling a list of my favorite **one word spells.** These spells
    are mostly derived from Latin, Gaelic, and Greek, and they have all been tried
    and tested by myself as well as other witches. They’re great when you’re in a
    pinch and need to cast a spell quickly without attracting notice!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, you could just say the single word and assume that your spell is done,
    but any of these one word spells will be more powerful if you either raise a bit
    of energy (between your hands, with a pendulum, in your mind’s eye, etc.) or perform
    a simple ritual as you say the word.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you could light a candle (I like to use colored tea light candles
    and choose my color based on the purpose of the spell) and raise energy that way,
    or burn a bay leaf with your intention written on it. Another easy way to activate
    these words is through noise, such as a gong or a bell, or by knotting a string
    as you repeat the word.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whatever your method is, you need to focus on your intention and *desired* outcome
    as if it has already come to pass. If I’m doing a spell for my dog’s safety, I’ll
    picture him safe and happy in his travels as if this is happening in the current
    moment, even if he’s sitting right next to me sleeping.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I recommend memorizing at least a few of these words (or writing them down in
    your phone) to use when you’re in a pinch!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you perform these spells, at the very least, raise a bit of energy between
    your palms and say the word 3 times, either in your mind or out loud, while you
    picture your desired outcome. These are all super simple spells that can be done
    around others without them even noticing!

    Cast the circle with your hand (by moving it in a circular motion) and/or using
    visualization to enhance the effects.

- en: This spell is used to strike up a conversation or to continue a conversation.
    It’s definitely a fire spell; the translation means that you’re literally asking
    for the conversation to catch fire. This would be extra effective if used with
    candle magic.

    energy to someone (you’re asking for the positive energy to flow to them), so
    you can send whatever kind of energy you’d like, whether it’s spiritual, mental,
    emotional, or physical. It helps to have a tool to direct the energy, although
    you can use your hands or finger as well.

    aura will fuzz and you will fade into the background so that you aren’t noticeable.
    Try to visualize fuzzing your aura as your chant this spell.

    especially effective (in my experience) when you’re on the subway, but it’s even
    great when you’re driving. It will essentially ask the universe to clear the path
    so that you get through every traffic light or stop as quickly as possible.
