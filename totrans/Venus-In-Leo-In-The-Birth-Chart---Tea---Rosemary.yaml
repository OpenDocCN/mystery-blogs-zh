- en: Generally, in a woman (or someone with feminine energy), Venus will show how
    the person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person
    is flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Venus in Leo. These Leo
    qualities will show up directly in the personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a man (or someone with masculine energy), Venus will show what kind of qualities
    they are *attracted to*. How this person will *act* depends on their Mars sign,

    partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we evolve and change and the gender lines blur, these distinctions become
    less absolute. For example, I find that *most* women will show a lot of the qualities
    of their Venus when they’re flirting, but a few of their Mars qualities will bleed
    through also.
  prefs: []

    combination of both qualities, although this combination may be swayed slightly
    depending on the person’s gender.

    more of his Venus qualities, while a man who struggles with his sexuality probably
    won’t “own” these Venusian qualities, so he will instead look for them in a female
    partner.
