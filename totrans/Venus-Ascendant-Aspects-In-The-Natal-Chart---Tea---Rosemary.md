Venus-Ascendant aspects are all about how beautiful, refined, charming, and loving you appear.

With these aspects, Venusian qualities will show up in your outer personality. Venus rules beauty, grace, style, and all things aesthetically pleasing.

The positive aspects mean that you embody these traits, while the more difficult aspects create issues with self-image and self-love.

## Venus Conjunct Ascendant:

With Venus conjunct Ascendant, you have style, grace, and natural beauty. In fact, you appear a bit like a Libra rising.

Other people find you attractive as soon as they meet you. Venus conjunct Ascendant creates a *lot* of refined and graceful physical beauty, but you also have an inner beauty that is evident.

You’re friendly and affectionate with other people. These are all natural qualities for you!

With Venus conjunct Ascendant, you also have a lot of instinctive charm. You know what people want to hear, plus you’re good looking enough to get away with a *lot*.

This aspect brings out the best qualities of Venus in your outer personality. People can see Venusian qualities in you as soon as they meet you.

Typically with the Venus conjunct Ascendant aspect, you also have a good sense of style and fashion.

You’re very graceful socially and may be quite popular, even if you don’t really try. You definitely have the “pretty boy” or “pretty girl” privilege.

Venus conjunct Ascendant gives you an almost angelic halo! You’re aesthetically pleasing and naturally sensual.

When people meet you, they tend to fall in love very quickly. In fact, romantic affairs might become an essential part of your self-image. It’s difficult for you to have relationships that don’t turn romantic.

You love beauty and harmony with Venus conjunct Ascendant. You want everything around you to be elegant and pleasing.

Be careful that you don’t become too self serving with the Venus conjunct Ascendant aspect. It’s easy to become very selfish with this aspect, because these qualities come naturally to you.

When you want beautiful things, they simply fall into your lap. Others are always enamored by you. This makes it hard for you to put yourself in other people’s shoes.

If Venus is in your 1st house, you will be especially aware of the effects that your Venus conjunct Ascendant aspect has on your outer personality. Venus in the 12th means that you will be unaware of these qualities, so you might be confused when other people react to you as though you’re an angel.

Ultimately with Venus conjunct Ascendant, you need to learn that you are more than your beauty and charm. Figure out who you are inside and learn how to reveal your inner self to other people.

Be careful that you don’t use your Venus conjunct Ascendant to harm others. You can easily charm or trick other people, but this won’t help you in the long run.

You need to learn how to value deeper love and hard work. Thing come naturally to you, at least at first, but the best things in your life will take time and work.

With Venus conjunct Ascendant, you have a need to love and be loved, but this can feel superficial. You want deeper love, yet you don’t know how to get it.

In fact, you may even swing back and forth between wanting love and expecting it to fall into your lap. Again, true love will take work.

You must learn how to find a true, deep love that isn’t just based on how things appear. Ultimately, you want people to love you for more than your beauty and charm, but you must reveal your deeper self for this to happen.

## Venus Trine Ascendant:

With Venus trine Ascendant, you are naturally supportive of others. Your personality is charming and non-threatening, so you are easy to be around.

In fact, you tend to compliment others naturally, whether this is through words or actions. You’re aesthetically pleasing without even trying!

Your vibe is calm and happy. Although your personality is Venusian, you also have the physically beautiful elements, too.

You may have a unique sense of fashion that fits your personality, or you might spend a lot of time on how you look. You might simply be physically beautiful or have an attractive energy that shines through.

With Venus trine Ascendant, you have a strong sense of artistry. You just *know *when something is refined and beautiful.

Venus trine Ascendant makes these talents natural for you. These traits are incorporated into your personality without effort; they are very consistent parts of your outer self.

However, you may be very particular about your style, appearance, or aesthetic. How this manifests will depend on the signs that your Venus trine Ascendant is in.

You may have a love for music, art, clothing, or other beautiful things. 

Although Venus trine Ascendant has a lot to do with physical beauty, you’re also very charming, generous, and helpful. Your outer personality is very pleasing!

Venus trine Ascendant can make you *very* giving. You might go too far and turn into a people pleaser, but this is only because you always want things to be nice and charming. You may go to great lengths to avoid unpleasant fights.

These qualities simply flow and are quite natural to you. They may even be subconscious, but your Venusian qualities will be very evident to *others*.

Be careful that, with Venus trine Ascendant, you don’t take these positive traits for granted. Remember that people want to know who you truly are beneath your mask.

Sometimes, the Venus trine Ascendant aspect makes it harder for you to develop a deeper sense of self. When everyone likes your mask, there’s no reason to do the inner work.

People naturally like you, but it’s very important with Venus trine Ascendant that you work to figure out who you are beneath your charm.

## Venus Sextile Ascendant:

With the Venus sextile Ascendant aspect, you feel a sense of ease and self-acceptance around other people. You may be charming and graceful in some way.

Typically, people see a sense of inner beauty in you. This might not be as obvious as the trine or conjunction, but you do have Venusian qualities that you can call upon in social situations.

Venus sextile Ascendant means you have a great sense of color and style that is uniquely yours. You may enjoy fashion, the arts, or other creative endeavors.

You can appear “Venusian” to other people when you try, but this is something you need to actively do. These qualities aren’t 100% integrated into your personality.

With Venus sextile Ascendant, you need to learn how to show your charm and social graces around other people. You already have the talents that you need, but you can learn how to switch this side of you on and off.

These qualities *can* be part of your mask, but they aren’t totally natural. You must work to become more Venusian.

Ultimately, you will find your Venusian qualities with this Venus sextile Ascendant aspect when you take time to develop your confidence.

However, always remember that there is more than just charm to a personality. You must simultaneously learn how to represent yourself authentically, rather than trying to show other people what you think they *want* to see.

## Venus Opposition Ascendant:

The Venus opposition Ascendant aspect is also called Venus conjunct Descendent or Venus setting. This aspect means that you *want* to feel beautiful, but you don’t know how to create harmony within yourself.

You have a lot of drive to gain acceptance and social status. You truly want to be liked, but you automatically assume that others won’t enjoy your company.

Venus opposition Ascendant means that you’re concerned with taste and aesthetics. You’re hyper-judgmental of your own appearance and design skills.

On a deeper level, you’re energetically sensitive as to what actions are appropriate, so you tend to be very careful around other people.

You’re afraid of reading situations improperly. Although you sometimes misread the signals, you tend to rectify your mistakes very quickly.

With Venus opposition Ascendant, you tend to see yourself on the surface level only. You may think that others can’t love you for anything but your appearance or outer aspects.

Even though Venus opposition Ascendant is a difficult aspect, you probably have an *easier* time socially. The issues come from within, but they aren’t necessarily apparent to others, so people might not realize you have these insecurities.

You truly desire a harmonious and peaceful life. In fact, aggressive people or conflict really upsets you, so you may become a peacekeeper within your family or friend group.

Venus opposition Ascendant means that you also desire tranquil, amicable relationships. You’re good at settling things in a peaceful way, so you tend to excel as a diplomat or in any field where negotiating is required.

Many of your Venusian qualities show themselves in one-on-one scenarios. You can deal much more easily with a singular person than you can with a group.

Although your artistic skills aren’t super obvious to others, you can be very creative or expressive in private. It’s important that, with Venus opposition Ascendant, you find an outlet for your creative side.

Venus opposition Ascendant can mean that your self-worth is tied to your partner or friend in one-on-one relationships. You may feel more self-confident or accepted when you have a partner in crime.

Sometimes, you can seek out approval a bit too much. Be careful that you develop a sense of self-love and don’t rely solely on someone else.

People with Venus opposition Ascendant usually marry for love and have long-lasting, peaceful relationships. You desire someone truly charming and harmonious.

Venus opposition Ascendant means that you may have a hard time seeing your own beauty. You’re only able to recognize the Venusian qualities in yourself when you’re not wearing your outer mask, so you can develop self-love when you spend time in private.

The goal is to learn how to integrate your own version of beauty into your outer personality. This happens when you actively learn to be less concerned about what others think.

Work to develop your morals about what *you* think is beautiful. Judge things using your own mind instead of looking at what *others* think.

## Venus Square Ascendant:

With Venus square Ascendant, you underestimate your true worth. You may feel that your appearance or outer self is all that matters, and you don’t see beauty in the deeper parts of your soul.

You’re probably never completely satisfied with the way that you look. You always feel as though something is missing or wrong, but you don’t know what it is.

Your looks aren’t what you consider beautiful. No matter how hard you try, you can never truly be as good looking as you want to be. 

Venus square Ascendant creates a strong need within you to fit into society. You want to be just as pleasant, charming, and aesthetically pleasing as everyone else, but you always find yourself lacking.

Although you project a lot of confidence, most of it isn’t real. Your self-esteem can disappear at any second because it doesn’t come from within.

Many of these traits with Venus square Ascendant come from a deep sense of inadequacy or shame. You feel that you aren’t lovable, so you *try* to create the look or outer personality of someone who is.

You feel like you’re never graceful or charming enough because you put *so much* value on how others see you. It’s impossible for you to see the truth about yourself.

You may come across as superficial with Venus square Ascendant. Your personality makes it seem like you’re only attracted to surface level things/people, or you may be drawn to sensual pleasures without a deeper sense of intimacy.

Venus square Ascendant also means that you *attract* superficial people. This is typically because you believe that superficiality is important *and* that it’s all you deserve.

People don’t try to get to know you on a deeper level. The type of individuals you attract won’t change until you rearrange your own values.

Ultimately, you still feel a sense of emptiness with Venus square Ascendant, because the problem comes from within. 

Venus square Ascendant is a sign that you need to learn how to love yourself. This includes the deepest parts of you *and *your outer mask.

Others’ approval will never give you the love that you seek with Venus square Ascendant.

Sexually, your preferences aren’t totally integrated with your inner personality. You will either be *too* sexual, or you will avoid physical intimacies altogether.

People with Venus square Ascendant may be the ones dressed in leather at a regular restaurant, or they’re the lifelong virgins. Sex is something that you want but are also afraid of.

Venus square Ascendant makes you magnetic, yet you also scare other people. They’re drawn to you but have negative feelings around you at the same time.

This aspect truly creates an imbalance within you in many ways. You can be very extreme about certain pleasures, but then you can also be too passive or act like a people pleaser.

Sometimes, people with Venus square Ascendant get taken advantage of because they don’t know how to say no to others.

To heal Venus square Ascendant, you will need to push against society. You are trying to live by the values of society surrounding beauty and charm, but they aren’t working for you.

The path is to go *within* and heal the shadow self. Others won’t find you beautiful on a deeper level until you truly love *yourself*.

To some people, ugliness is more beautiful than charm when it’s *real*. The goal is to look at what is true, rather than focusing on how things appear. After all, you have everything you need inside, but these values simply need to be accessed.

Venus square Ascendant is all about healing the inner self and learning to love oneself without the acceptance of others. You must heal your self esteem and discover what love truly means to you.
