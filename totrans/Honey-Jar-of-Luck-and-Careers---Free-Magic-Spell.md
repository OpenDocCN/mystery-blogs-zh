Why should we draw a pentagram? How about Hexagram and Flower of life maybe? This is about harmony, isn't it? Could you please explain why? (in a Simple way, so We can remember it more easily)

This is my new account, a pentagram is considered stronger for magick, well in my experience however if you would like to do a hexagram and flower of life you can :). This was also when I first started writing spells,so even a pinnacle would work.
