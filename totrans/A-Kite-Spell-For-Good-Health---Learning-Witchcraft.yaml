- en: Kites have been used for thousands of years by people in the Far East to carry
    messages to the gods. You might as well follow their example. You can make a kite
    easily if you don’t want to have to buy one. It is best to cast this spell on
    a day that is breezy.

    onto the string,and feel it continue to get tighter until it finally snaps and
    your kite is free to fly away in the wind, as it takes your wishes along with
