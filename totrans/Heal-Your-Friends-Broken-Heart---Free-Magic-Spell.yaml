- en: That's really nice; most people only ever request spells for themselves and
    that can be problematic. Doing a loving heart healing spell for another person
    is a wonderful gift. You can use this spell for any friend who could do with more
    love in their lives, or a relative, or a lover, or a child. Beautiful spell, only
    two ingredients - your intention and your love.

    the heart and take your time to think about your friend, about how much you love
    them, and your real desire to help them. Breathe deeply and let the emotions rise
    up so you can really feel them; thats the energy which powers the spell.
