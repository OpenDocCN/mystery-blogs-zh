    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [moldavite.](https://wiccanow.com/moldavite-the-spiritual-synergist/)
    Today I thought we’d focus on another beautiful “crystal”, namely amber.

- en: '**Amber is not actually a crystal but rather the fossilized resin of ancient
    pine trees. Amber has fascinated humans since antiquity and stores of amber have
    been found in caves dating back to the stone age. Amber was often used throughout
    the ancient world and was regarded as the ‘gold of the north’. The Etruscans made
    ornaments and jewellery out of amber and wore these as talismans. The ancient
    Greeks believed that amber was formed from the tears of the daughters of the sun
    god Helios, who cried after the death of their brother Phaethon. Amber has a pleasing
    scent when burned and was favoured as an incense through ancient Asia. In medieval
    Europe, amber was believed to protect against sorcery and necklaces made from
    beads of amber were often placed on babies in order to offer them protection from
    harm.**'

    It can be translucent to opaque and has a vitreous lustre. Amber can actually
    become electrically charged (like tourmaline or topaz) and is therefore prone
    to attracting dust.

    and calming energy. Place a piece of amber next to your pillow or hold a piece
    in each hand as you meditate to and allow its golden energy to soothe and comfort
    you.

    that inhabit it. For those wanting to connect with nature on a deeper level, try
    walking with a piece of amber in your hand. Allow the frequency of the amber to
    guide you as you experience nature.

    a piece of amber in each hand. Picture the warm golden light of the amber severing
    ties with that which is no longer wanted. Allow it to bath you in a soothing glow
    of regenerative energy. Feel its frequency as it shines a light on all of your
    negative belief structures and helps to loosen these structures thereby allowing
    you to move forward unburdened.
