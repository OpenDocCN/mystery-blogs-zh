- en: The Midheaven (MC) and the Imum coeli (IC) are two opposite points in astrology
    that are calculated based on your place and time of birth. The IC shows the qualities
    that you learned in childhood and the environment that you wanted to escape.

  zh: 中天宫（MC）和天底宫（IC）是占星术中两个相反的点，根据你的出生地点和时间计算而来。天底宫显示了你在童年学到的特质和你想要逃避的环境。
- en: In order to get away from the values of the IC, you push towards the Midheaven.
    In fact, the Midheaven is how people tend to perceive you in the outer world,
    but more specifically in your career. Although you may embrace the qualities of
    the Midheaven, the IC always exists underneath.

- en: The IC in Libra placement is all about being the peacemaker in childhood, but
    because the Midheaven is the opposite point, your Midheaven in Aries means that
    you push through to shine as an individual in *adulthood*.

- en: IC in Libra tends to be focused mainly on image. It manifests differently in
    every family, but the common thread is usually that you had to make things *look*
    a certain way. This conflicted with your own inner values and left you with a
    broken sense of self.
