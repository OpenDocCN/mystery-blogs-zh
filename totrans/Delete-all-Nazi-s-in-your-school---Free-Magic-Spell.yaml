- en: This spell will automatically delete all Nazi's at your school or in the building
    you are in. Use if Nazi's begin spawning rapidly or are summoned in bulk. Do not
    attempt unless you are anti-fascist and willing to punch a Nazi, if you aren't
    and attempt this spell, spontaneous combustion may occur.

    he should be deleted as soon as your wig smack's his face and the rest should
    de-spawn soon after.

    and further tarnishes our credibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I suppose ''spellname, activate'' could be a trigger praise for a real spell
    if set up in advance (at least I think that's a thing), but yes, this is obviously
    not a real spell at all.

- en: Theoretically, yes. So mote it be or so shall it be are more common endings
    to spells. See also *amen* for Christians to end a prayer. Whatever you feel indicates
    the end of a spell, or as a way to release the energy, go with that. However,
    my issue is so many fake spells are claiming you just say *activate* and **boom**
    you cast a spell. No. When you say *so mote it be* it indicates you have concluded
    the spell. You should have built energy and have been directing it toward your
    goal before you reach that phrase. These spells claim you simple point and say
    *activate* and you have cast a spell. Infuriating. Spells require ***a lot***
    more effort than that. If you personally wish to use *activate* at the end of
    the spell, go for it. But the vast majority of The Pagan Community does not. With
    the influx of these nonsense posts, I worry it will become a new *hex the moon*
    situation. It is hard enough to be taken seriously without this absurdity.
