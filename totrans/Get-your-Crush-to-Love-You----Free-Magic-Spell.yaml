- en: Go into a quiet room. It really doesn't matter if someone else is there with
    you as long as they're quiet and aren't distracting you. Sit crossed legged on
    the floor and take your lipgloss ( or lipstick ) and apply it thoroughly to your
    lips.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take the piece of paper (rip it into a rectangle-type shape), and press your
    lips to the center of the paper; essentially kissing the paper.
  prefs: []

    crush''s full name above the lip print; example: Jamie (if you know his/her middle
    name then put it there but if you don''t it really doesn''t matter) Quinn Maslow.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Put the paper in front of you, as you sit cross legged, and hold your hands
    about a foot above. Close your eyes and really concentrate on it *think of your
    crush AND the spell*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Say ''*Crush's full name* needs to love me. Have him/her see the true qualities
    that consist in my soul, and I shall do the same. Spread our love eternally and
    forever until we both die. He is funny, smart, and witty, along like me and I
    promise to do nothing but saint-work for eternity.'' JUST ONCE!

- en: As outlined, this does not work. You cannot get someone to love you in such
    a short period of time, especially with such little Magik. You need to repeat
    a chant to build energy. Saying it once does nothing. The items listed do connect
    your energy to your crushes, nor do they contain love energy. The chant is also
    flawed. It sounds deranged, possessive, demanding, and unrealistic. Not to mention
    it does not flow correctly. On a personal level, you are forcing someone to be
    with you. This is not love, this is manipulation. If you have a crush, you can
    try a love spell to make them notice you, but love spells work to remove barrier
    and help you talk to them. They do not force them to obey you like some love zombie.
    They will still have free will. Unless you rework it, I do not see this working
    well if at all.

- en: I will also warn you to be specific, accurate with your wording, and do not
    over charge a love spell. Doing so can result in a stalker. I know teens are obsessed
    with Magik for two reasons; love and vengeance. Ever since middle school, I would
    have students approach me and say the same thing ''You're a witch, right? Can
    you cast a love spell/curse for me.'' I can only think of one instance where the
    request was justified. The vast majority were either a love spell because they
    were too afraid to talk to their crush, or a curse because they were jealous of
    someone. I also know my warning will fall on deaf ears because I would give this
    explanation to the request only to be told why ''my situation is different'' when
    it never was. Love spells come in a variety of types, but the *make your crush
    love you* spells are the absolute worst. Not only for the fact you are forcing
    someone to be with you, but those who cast them seldom remove emotions and truly
    contemplate what they are doing. *Yeah, I thought about it, and I determined it's
    the right thing to do.* You did not. You went *it is morally wrong to force someone,
    but this situation is different because I'm in love.* That is not thinking about
    it subjectively. You barely know this person and you are forcing them to be with
    you forever. A spell makes them go out with you, and then it fades away. You need
    to build that love, the spell will not make it for you. The spell fades, the person
    leaves you. This leaves you with two options, either do the work required for
    a serious relationship, or cast love spells every month forever. The second option
    will definitely backfire.

- en: I found a similar spell back in high school. [only difference was the chant]
    Didn't work. I cast it a couple of times, never worked. While I'm not a fan of
    ''Get your crush to love you'' spells, don't waste your time on this one and find
    a spell that actually works.
