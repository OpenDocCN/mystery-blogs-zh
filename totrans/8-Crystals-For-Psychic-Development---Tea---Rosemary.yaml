- en: Crystals are hugely popular in the occult world, for good reason! Whether you’re
    a beginner divination student or an advanced witch, you’ll find that specific
    crystals for psychic development enhance your energy and unlock certain abilities
    that you might not know you have.

- en: Of course, we don’t *need* crystals to practice divination or to become psychic.
    We all have that inner knowing already inside of us. I find that crystals help
    us tap into that inner knowing and enhance our energy.

- en: The great thing about crystals is that you can choose your crystal based on
    your desired outcome. For example, you’ll choose a different crystal if you want
    to communicate with your angels than if you want to ground yourself.

- en: The first thing you should *always* do when you get a new crystal is to thoroughly
    cleanse it. Some crystals are self-cleansing, but most aren’t. Regardless, it
    never hurts to cleanse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like to leave my crystals on the windowsill overnight to cleanse. They get
    a bit of sunlight and a bit of moonlight (both of which are cleansing in different
    ways) and this resets the energy completely. You can also clean your crystals
    using incense (if you want quicker results) or by placing the crystal in sea salt
    for a bit.
  prefs: []

- en: Next, you need to connect with the energy of the crystal. Every crystal has
    its own energy and personality. You need to develop a relationship with your crystal
    that is specifically for the purpose of working on your psychic abilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I recommend sitting with your crystal in your hands and spending a few moments
    connecting with its energy. Feel the vibrations coming from your crystal. You
    can ask it if it would like to work with you to develop your psychic abilities.
    If the crystal doesn’t want to, then you won’t be able to use this specific crystal
    for the purpose of psychic development; keep going until you find one that is
    agreeable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the first few weeks, try to spend consistent time with your crystal. You
    can wear it, carry the stone around in your pocket, or meditate holding the crystal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have connected, you can continue doing all of these things while also
    using your crystal during divination practice. For example, you can place the
    crystal on your third eye or crown chakra when meditating, surround yourself with
    many crystals while working on divination, hold the crystal in your hand to access
    its energetic power, or sleep with your crystal under your bed or pillow to enhance
    psychic dreams.

    It can be anywhere from light purple to dark purple, although sometimes it is
    even clear or translucent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amethyst is a great crystal for psychic development. It works to open the Third
    Eye and Crown Chakras, so Amethyst is perfect for both beginner and advanced students.
    Amethyst is one of my favorite crystals for psychic clairvoyance and psychic protection,
    although the energy is really strong, so you need to be sure that you’re ready.
    If you’re just dabbling, a weaker crystal may be better.

    crystal. Make sure to test the energy of the crystal to see how it wants to be

    will protect you from anything negative while you work.
  prefs: []

    dreams and show the shadow self.
  prefs: []
