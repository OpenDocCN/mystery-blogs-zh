    that, in reality, it either is or isn''t. This can be confusing for the one who
    is trying to understand how to develop this faculty when they might not be able
    to exactly pinpoint what it is that they''re trying to develop.*'

- en: Clairvoyance has been a part of many spiritual and religious practices throughout
    history. The term “clairvoyance” can be broken down into two parts. “Clair” is
    a French word meaning “clear” or “clear sight” and “voyance” is derived from the
    Latin word “visio” meaning “vision.” Together, these two words can be translated
    to mean “clear sight” or “clear seeing.”

    be able to use one''s inner senses to receive "images" or observe an inner pictorial
    language, in one''s own mind, related to questions or various in-sights.*'

- en: Sometimes people assume that Clairvoyance means they have to see things in front
    of themselves physically, in such detail and realism that they shouldn't even
    be able to tell the difference between their reality and their vision. The truth
    is, this is not the case for a majority of psychic clairvoyants. **Most visions
    are seen through the "mind's eye,**" in a similar manner like you would day dream
    or envision a scene from a movie.

    and future of the universe - its beginning, middle, and end.

    to put together likely occurring events. It's not always about someone being able
    to know absolutely everything about a person and their previous incarnations,
    however, if one has clairvoyance well developed, they may become more aware of
    the subtleties in a person's life based on that person's character and how they
    present themselves.

- en: In addition, it is important to understand that clairvoyance is not a form of
    fortune-telling. People who are clairvoyant do not have the ability to predict
    the future. Instead, they are able to gain insight into the present and past,
    as well as to gain understanding about the energies, entities, and other phenomena
    that exist around them.

- en: Therefore, the clairvoyant is simply **perceiving the energy that is made available
    to them**, in whatever way. Sometimes it can be very telling, other times a certain
    energy can even seem so pure that it appears as if it was intentionally being
    well disguised. The more practiced and developed one is with this faculty, and
    also the more pure one's character is, the better they'll be able to read things
    with the use of clairvoyance, which is **a**  **completely natural ability**.

    according to their own inner sight, and can make more and **more informed judgements**
    of the future based on the previous success that they've had, which they can continue
    to draw from and build upon with the development of this faculty.

- en: Clairvoyance is a term that has been used for centuries to describe an ability
    to see things that are not visible to the naked eye. **It is not a magical ability
    or a form of fortune-telling, and it is not something that can be acquired overnight.**
    People who are clairvoyant are simply able to access information that is not available
    to the average person, and they are not able to control or manipulate others.
    Understanding the true nature of clairvoyance is essential to being able to use
    it responsibly.
