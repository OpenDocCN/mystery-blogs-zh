- en: Place the towel/flannel in the water, then squeeze most of it out and lie it
    down on the floor. Put the candle on it (has to be lit already). If the object
    is a drawing/printout, place it under the candle. If not, put it in front of the
    candle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pour a small amount of water (like a few drips, but it has to put the candle
    out and go over the item) over the candle and object. If it is a printout/drawing,
    take it out from under the candle. Make sure it doesn't rip. If it is an object,
    just hold it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After holding the item for about 2 seconds, place it down. Move your hand where
    you want it to move/go/follow/whatever and imagine it following your hand. Make
    sure to use the same hand every time; only one hand will be able to do the tele/psychokinesis
    until you train the other one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Practice imagining this for a few days (with the same item) until it moves.
    Even if it's a tiny bit, if it moves it's fine. Now start trying to move it, you
    don't have to imagine it. Only try moving it less than a metre for now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Practice. It will probably take up to a month to move this object. Once you
    can move it, try other objects of the same size, then slowly get bigger. In about
    2 months you could start being able to move living things, 3 months large objects
    like rocks, 4 possibly cars and even humans.

- en: Wrong. Scientists are so close to confirming the existence of telekinesis/psychoknesis...
    your views are your own, don't force them upon anyone! Free will and all that
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What scientific studies exactly? Also what's your point regarding ''free will''
    I stated a fact, your free will wasn't impacted in any way, you can still choose
    to ignore what I say [as you are right now] I'm not trying to effect your free
    will, you still have the choice to believe someone or not
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I personally disagree, because the way I see it magick is just finely tuned
    energy, and scientists have found a way to turn *light* into *matter*. I'm sure
    it's extremely difficult and much harder than this spell suggests, but I'm confident
    that it's not impossible. If you can kill with magick, shut down a living creature's
    functions only with energy, is it really that much harder to believe you can move
    objects, even if it's a little bit? I don't know I haven't been working with this
    type of magick for very long but from what I do know, theoretically, it should
    be probable

- en: SaraMae, I too believe that something like telekinesis can be done, but only
    through careful study and a lot of practice. But I'd like to say that death spells
    don't shut down a living creature's functions with energy alone. Usually, death
    spells result in the target dying by a normal cause, such as a car crash. They
    don't kill the person out of nowhere and depending on spell ingredients, personal
    magickal ability of the caster, and level of caution in the victim, these spells
    can take years to work.

- en: I'm not very good with my words but that's sorta what I meant in a very dramatic
    way. Thank you for wording it better than I could lmao I honestly appreciate it.
    when you die your body shuts down and you cast the spell to make them die somehow
    that's kinda what I was getting at thank you

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you believe in the ability to move objects with your mind, that's fine with
    me [personally, I don't] but if it's possible, it takes practice, not a spell.
    Spells require energy to influence energy. Telekinesis is your brainwaves moving
    physical objects, so it wouldn't be a spell you would need. You can strengthen
    your clairvoyance, psychic abilities, and be able to see/speak with spiritual
    beings [all things I've done] but when it comes to moving objects with your mind,
    no spell will work, only practice, and even then I'm skeptical.
