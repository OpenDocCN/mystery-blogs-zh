    down on the floor. Put the candle on it (has to be lit already). If the object

- en: Pour a small amount of water (like a few drips, but it has to put the candle
    out and go over the item) over the candle and object. If it is a printout/drawing,
    take it out from under the candle. Make sure it doesn't rip. If it is an object,
    just hold it.

- en: After holding the item for about 2 seconds, place it down. Move your hand where
    you want it to move/go/follow/whatever and imagine it following your hand. Make
    sure to use the same hand every time; only one hand will be able to do the tele/psychokinesis
    until you train the other one.

  zh: 拿起物品约2秒钟后，放下。移动你希望它移动/去/跟随/任何其他动作的手并想象它跟随你的手移动。确保每次只用同一只手；只有一只手能进行念/灵动术，直到你训练了另一只手。
- en: Practice imagining this for a few days (with the same item) until it moves.
    Even if it's a tiny bit, if it moves it's fine. Now start trying to move it, you
    don't have to imagine it. Only try moving it less than a metre for now.

  zh: 练习几天想象这个（用同一物品）直到它动起来。即使只是一点点，只要它动了就好。现在开始试着移动它，你不必再想象它。目前只试着移动不到一米。
- en: Practice. It will probably take up to a month to move this object. Once you
    can move it, try other objects of the same size, then slowly get bigger. In about
    2 months you could start being able to move living things, 3 months large objects
    like rocks, 4 possibly cars and even humans.

  zh: 练习。可能需要一个月才能移动这个物体。一旦你能移动它，尝试其他同样大小的物体，然后慢慢变大。大约2个月后，你可以开始移动生物，3个月大物体如石头，4个月甚至可能是汽车和人类。

    I stated a fact, your free will wasn't impacted in any way, you can still choose
    to ignore what I say [as you are right now] I'm not trying to effect your free
    will, you still have the choice to believe someone or not

- en: I personally disagree, because the way I see it magick is just finely tuned
    energy, and scientists have found a way to turn *light* into *matter*. I'm sure
    it's extremely difficult and much harder than this spell suggests, but I'm confident
    that it's not impossible. If you can kill with magick, shut down a living creature's
    functions only with energy, is it really that much harder to believe you can move
    objects, even if it's a little bit? I don't know I haven't been working with this
    type of magick for very long but from what I do know, theoretically, it should
    be probable

- en: SaraMae, I too believe that something like telekinesis can be done, but only
    through careful study and a lot of practice. But I'd like to say that death spells
    don't shut down a living creature's functions with energy alone. Usually, death
    spells result in the target dying by a normal cause, such as a car crash. They
    don't kill the person out of nowhere and depending on spell ingredients, personal
    magickal ability of the caster, and level of caution in the victim, these spells
    can take years to work.

    way. Thank you for wording it better than I could lmao I honestly appreciate it.
    when you die your body shuts down and you cast the spell to make them die somehow
    that's kinda what I was getting at thank you

- en: If you believe in the ability to move objects with your mind, that's fine with
    me [personally, I don't] but if it's possible, it takes practice, not a spell.
    Spells require energy to influence energy. Telekinesis is your brainwaves moving
    physical objects, so it wouldn't be a spell you would need. You can strengthen
    your clairvoyance, psychic abilities, and be able to see/speak with spiritual
    beings [all things I've done] but when it comes to moving objects with your mind,
    no spell will work, only practice, and even then I'm skeptical.
