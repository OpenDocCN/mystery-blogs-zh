- en: Lol alright, another person who apparently thinks being rude and hostile makes
    an argument come across well. Also, bottom of the page? You mean in the article
    where it says it will take a month and seven days? Seems irrelevant to my point,
    considering it's fake either way. The bottom of the page where it says that you
    should use common sense when following the spells? Because I'm just pointing out
    the common sense that should be used. Other than just coming across as a bit irritable,
    I'm not really sure what you were going for with your comment.

- en: But they said it would work in one month and seven days! Why would someone lie
    on the internet? Seriously, I do love how people who don't like us explaining
    why certain spells don't work go attack dog instead of having an informed rebuttal.
    Anyway, Challenger, Rhododendrons isn't being mean, they're explaining a fact.
    Magick doesn't contradict nature, therefore physical transformations like the
    one mentioned in this ''spell'' is completely fake. You can look into working
    with astral mermaids [as some do believe they exist] calling on water spirits
    in your spells, working with deities associated with water, or associating the
    element and mermaid imagery into your path. But you cannot become a physical mermaid
    because that's not how magick works.

    and so is Rhododendron. It's not that we don't believe, it is the fact that we
    know real and not real magick.

    clicked on my picture, it would take you to my profile and the answers you seek.
    Firstly, my current picture is of The Horned God and The Triple Goddess, my deities
    I worship. If you read my profile, you would discover I was raised Wiccan, I believe
    in Magic, and have zero tolerance for fake spells. Real Magic is a natural energy.
    On the physical plane, it is ruled by nature, and does not defy nature. You can
    work with astral mermaids, you can use their symbolism in your craft, you can
    put on a fake tail and pretend to be a mermaid. What you cannot do is physically
    transform into one as it defies nature.
