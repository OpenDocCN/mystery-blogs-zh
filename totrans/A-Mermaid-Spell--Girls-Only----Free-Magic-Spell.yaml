    place it on the right side of you, take the white candle and place it behind you,
    and take the green candle and place it on the left side of you. Next, light the
    candles. Take the perfume or body mist and spray some on you, it does not matter
    where you spray it, nor how much. Take the necklace and put it on. Make sure that
    there is ocean sound playing in the background. Chant this five times: Goddess
    of the Sea, oh, hear my plea! Send a Mermaid Tail to Me! Make all the boys fall
    for Me! Send Water, Fire, Air and Earth control to this body! Make me smell like
    the perfume I always wanted! Oh, Goddess of the Sea, will you hear my plea? After
    you chant the spell, blow out the candles in order (blow the blue out first, blow
    the red out second, blow the white out third, and blow the green out fourth) Do
    not touch water for the rest of the day. That morning, you should have your mermaid
    tail. Happy Swimming!'

    You can not physically shapeshift. No amount of belief will change facts.

    you can't become a mermaid. (Ignoring the fact that there are plenty of paths
    and individuals that use things other than belief to make their spells effective.)

- en: You can substitute candles. The spell outline claims each candle represents
    an element, so you could swap it with another representation. It could be coloured
    objects like beads or cloth [yellow=air red=fire blue=water green=earth] or you
    could use other representations [feather=air spicy food=fire water=water salt=earth]

    a mermaid.
