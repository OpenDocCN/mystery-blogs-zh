## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the Five of Cups card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

Here is a new interpretation of the Five of Cups tarot card:

The Five of Cups represents the emotional toll of social media and online communication.

 In today’s world, we are constantly exposed to the highlight reels of other people’s lives, which can lead to feelings of disappointment, loss, and grief when comparing our own lives to the curated versions of others.

The overturned cups could represent the unrealistic expectations and false sense of perfection that social media can create. The figure in the card could represent the person feeling a sense of melancholy and emptiness as they scroll through their feeds.

In this interpretation, the upright cups in the background could represent the possibility of disconnecting and finding balance in one’s digital life.

 The figure’s contemplative pose could suggest that the person is taking the time to reflect on their relationship with social media and learning to find self-acceptance, rather than constantly comparing themselves to others.

This card could be a reminder to focus on one’s own life and emotional well-being, rather than constantly comparing it to others’ curated versions of reality.
