    items for this spell:** First of all, all species are related, we have fish genes
    in our bodies and in our legs, with merfolk not being a found species yet, no,
    their not really astral or spirits. Yes we can turn it back into a tail, by turning
    back on though genes.  Now, the native americans can shape shift... don''t try
    to say they were astrally shifting, physical, you can''t just call them fake.
    Google or search "mermaid shifting". I hate when someone on here says that magic
    can''t change our appearance, and they say that on a page of shape shifting. Shape
    shift and magic(k) are 100% different. This is not to be rude, it''s to educate.
    Shape shifters don''t need a human telling us what and isn''t possible, again,
    no offence. Humans only use a small percentage of their brain, if one unlocks
    another part of their brain, they could unlock shape shifting, I''m using merfolk
    as an example, and it''s not like in h2o and thoughs shows where you touch water
    and get a tail, then you get to dry off and get legs again, it could take and
    hour... it could take a week, to get legs again.'

- en: Physical transformation is not real. There are otherkins and therians which
    are physically real, however, they do not physically transform. They are spirits
    in the wrong physical vessel. A wolf spirit in a human body, or a vampire in a
    physical body. They cannot physically transform into what their spirit is. Claiming
    Native Americans can shapeshift is a racist stereotype and not a fact. It is rooted
    in the mysticism of their culture by white society and the result of a sacred
    ceremony by one indigenous culture. Indigenous peoples are not a monolith, just
    because one tribe believes the final test of a shaman is to be taught shapeshifting,
    does not mean every native person can shapeshift. Twilight perpetuated this stereotype
    and the Quileute people have been trying to educate people against it ever since.

  zh: 物理转化并非真实。有其他信仰和灵兽者，他们在物理上确实存在，但他们并不进行物理转变。他们是活在错误物质容器中的精灵。一个狼精灵在人类身体里，或者吸血鬼在物理身体里。他们不能物理转变为他们的精神形态。声称美洲原住民可以变形是一种种族主义刻板印象，而非事实。这根植于白人社会对其文化神秘主义的看法，和一个土著文化中的神圣仪式的结果。土著民族不是一个整体，仅因为一个部落相信一个萨满的最终考验是被教导变形，不意味着每个土著人都能变形。《暮光之城》延续了这种刻板印象，而夸雷乌特人一直在努力教育人们反对它。
- en: I goggled ''mermaid shifting'' like you asked. The top three links is a youtube
    video, which I do not consider ''evidence.'' She did provide links in the description
    and warn against not believing everything you hear online which won her some brownie
    points. She was also describing how to reality shift, which is real and is possible.
    She spoke about a TikTok, which is a giant red flag for me. She did insinuate
    your physical vanishes when you mentally shift, which does not happen. However,
    she spoke about dressing like a mermaid and not physically transforming, lucid
    dreaming, and other transformations not on the physical plane, which are all ways
    to transform. You cannot will your legs to become a tail, but you can buy a mermaid
    tail to wear. The next link on Google was Wattpad, which is not credible, followed
    by an Etsy shop and finally Pinterest. None of these are credible evidence.

  zh: 我像您要求的那样搜索了 ''人鱼转移''。前三个链接是一个YouTube视频，我不认为这是''证据''。她在描述中提供了链接，并警告不要相信网络上的一切，这赢得了她一些好感。她也描述了如何进行现实转移，这是真实的，也是可能的。她谈到了一个TikTok，对我来说是一个巨大的警告信号。她暗示了你的身体在你精神转移时会消失，这是不会发生的。但是，她谈到了如何扮扮成人鱼，而不是进行身体上的变换，清醒梦以及在非物质平面上的其他转变，这都是转变的方式。你不能通过意志让你的腿变成尾巴，但你可以购买一个人鱼尾巴来穿戴。Google的下一个链接是Wattpad，这不可靠，然后是一个Etsy商店，最后是Pinterest。这些都不是可靠的证据。
- en: All things are Magik. Magik is a neutral energy that brings change. You could
    argue technology is Magik because the energy of change (Magik) influenced/inspired
    someone to invent something. They wanted to fly, they manifested flight into their
    reality by inventing a plane. Magik is everywhere and in every thing. Magik was
    science before we knew what science was. The video about mermaids spoke of wearing
    a mermaid tail to ''become'' a mermaid. That can count as Magik. You can create
    a ritual and wear the tail. You are still physically human, but you can achieve
    goals if you look at them another way.

  zh: 万物都是魔力。魔力是一种带来改变的中性能量。你可以说技术也是魔力，因为改变的能量（魔力）影响/激发了某人创造某事物。他们想要飞行，他们通过发明飞机将飞行变成了他们的现实。魔力无处不在，存在于一切事物之中。魔力之前是科学。关于人鱼的视频谈到穿上人鱼尾巴就能“变成”人鱼。那也可以算是魔力。你可以创造一个仪式，穿上尾巴。你仍然是物理上的人类，但如果你从另一个角度着眼，你可以实现目标。
- en: I love how you called me and people like me ''haters'' in the description, only
    to get to the spell where you say you hate people trying to educate, followed
    by claiming you do not mean to be rude, and concluding with insulting people who
    try to educate. But you ended that sentence with ''no offense'' so clearly you
    are off the hook. You can slander anyone with anything, but end your statement
    with ''no offense'' and be a-okay. For the record, I have a goal of commenting
    on all the sites spells to try and help new members sort through fact and fiction.
    Fake spells are quicker to get through so I began there. As for others, someone
    comments ''I'm a mermaid thanks to this spell'' and those who know the spell is
    fake want to stop the spread of misinformation. They are not haters, they are
    worried one persons lies will harm others. One bad apple spoils the bunch.

  zh: 我喜欢你在描述中称呼我和像我这样的人为“讨厌者”，然后在拼写到你讨厌那些试图教育的人时，以及声称你不是故意无礼时，最后又侮辱那些试图教育的人。但你又用“无意冒犯”结尾，所以显然你没有错。你可以用任何事物中伤任何人，只需在陈述结尾加上“无意冒犯”，一切都好。顺便说一句，我的目标是在所有网站的拼写中发表评论，以帮助新成员区分事实和虚构。假拼写更容易处理，所以我就从那里开始。至于其他人，有人评论说“多亏了这个咒语，我变成了人鱼”，那些知道这个咒语是假的人想阻止错误信息的传播。他们不是讨厌者，他们担心一个人的谎言会伤害其他人。一个腐臭的苹果会烂掉一整筐。

    then you physically transform into one. It is complete nonsense. It defies all
    natural laws. We have a plethora of evidence debunking all of your lies and yet,
    none of it will register because ''I believe'' and then I am handed a link to
    a YouTube video by WakeUpSheeple123 and am told I am the liar. There are astral
    mermaids. You can work with mermaid spirits. You can dress like a mermaid. You
    can call on their energy to help in your craft. You can mentally and astrally
    shift into mermaids. Physically is 100% fake and will never work. Period.

- en: uhhhh, no. Theres no such thing as ''unlocking'' the full potential of the brain.
    You dont show understanding of much science either (i mean like we are all just
    people on the internet so of course its not like required to have scientific knowledge
    and lots of research to theorize) You are basically saying that humans are stupider
    than us, and thats not true. Ive met a lot of stupid people who are shifters,
    and ive met many smart people who are human. I think you might be talking more
    of ignorance than anything. Many people choose to be ignorant to certain things,
    but that doesnt mean that they are incapable of preforming these sorts of things.
    Ive seen plenty of stories of people shifting into an animal at a very young age,
    or at least being very animal-like at a young age. You do have a point for some
    things (such as the H2O, or that magic and physical shifting is different.) but
    overall everything else is wrong. I mean like, nobody should expect for random
    internet people to have proficient understanding of their topic, because I do
    see that you had a point with this post.

    it was not doing any harm, I was going to gain a valuable lesson on my own, and
    they liked that I was finally doing *some* form of meditation. Sometimes you need
    to learn for yourself. We all make mistakes. You learn, you apply the lesson,
    you move on. It is when we dwell and refuse to admit fault we suffer.
