- en: This spell is one based on knot magic and is used to ensure that your energy
    is at the right level for your magical work. Buckles, belts or girdles were often
    associated with Isis or Venus and therefore aspects of femininity. They represent
    physical well-being and moral strength. It can be performed on a Wednesday.

- en: Decide before you begin the purpose of your girdle. To specifically use one
    for health issues you might choose the colour blue, or to work from-a spiritual
    perspective choose purple orwhite. Begin braiding the cord and as you do so bear
    in mind that you are fashioning three aspects-of self, body mind and spirit to
    become one-source of power in all that you do. In this way the braid becomes an
    extension of -you and also a protector of your being.

    it also prepares you to be-able to help others as they require it. Since Isis

    pain and distress.
