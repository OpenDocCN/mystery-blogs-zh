    on it. Light the candle as it is burning down toward that first line. Stay focused
    on the flame and watch it take on your refusal to get drawn into the original
    spellcaster. While you are doing this, say the words from the first spell repeatedly
    until your candle is burned all the way down to the first line. Then use a snuffer
    or your finger and thumb to extinguish it.
