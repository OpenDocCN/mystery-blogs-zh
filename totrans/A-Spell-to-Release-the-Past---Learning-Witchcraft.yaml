- en: Also known as the cord-cutting ritual, this spell helps release emotional, mental
    and spiritual ties that rob you of growth, peace and happiness. By using the power
    of your calm, clear mind and amplifying it, this spell helps end any unwanted
    relationships and ties in your life, leaving no harm behind if performed correctly.
    It doesn’t have to be directed towards another person – you can also release any
    part of your own energy that is ridden with doubt and darkness, such as harmful
    habits or negative beliefs.

- en: The most important part of this sacred ritual is staying true to yourself. While
    you perform it, allow yourself to feel any feelings that come up in your heart,
    and allow the resulting energy to become the foundation of your work. If you wish,
    you can also call for help from any friendly spirits or deceased relatives (preferably
    those you worked with before).
