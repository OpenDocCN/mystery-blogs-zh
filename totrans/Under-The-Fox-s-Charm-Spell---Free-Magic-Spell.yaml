- en: Place the bowl in the center of the altar, draw a magick circle around the space
    of the bowl for the working with you finger visualizing energy. Then Place salt
    and the white flower of your choice into the bowl. Draw a summoning, or drawing
    in a pentagram in the air above the bowl while visualizing a white Red Fox getting
    closer into view. Visualize that magick circle you just drew trapping the fox
    spirit inside the circle, stabilizing the being behind the bowl. Take the red
    pen and petition paper and draw an attracting pentagram, the write around it these
    words," To become wanted after by the ones I see, may they only see me, safe I
     be around thy." then place the talisman you know have into the bowl. Visualize
    while in a trance yourself compelling the white fox to enter the talisman and
    serve thy for six days. When the Fox agrees and enters the talisman promise the
    spirt the white flower as an offering as well as the salt and energy from the
    bowl. ( Therefore not that talisman). After things are done end the spell by dispersing
    the magick circle. Place the bowl of salt and the white flower on your altar as
    an offering to the fox. Take the talisman and keep it on your person for six days
    then you will know to return it to the bowl as well as the fox it's self. You
    may also allow the tsukimono to live in your home or banish the being after it
    has taken its prize.
