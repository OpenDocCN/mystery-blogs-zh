 Cast the Circle, Fill it with a loving atmosphere using this chant: Walk around the area 2 times chanting this verse each time you walk around your altar space "I consecrate this space with Isis's Loving Spirit and Hecate's Magick to Aid me In this Ritual"

While doing this picture a pink/red line of energy forming in the middle of the area, and picture it pulsing energy across the space with hearts flowing around it. the more concentration you put in the better the effect.

Light the White Tealights & the Lotus incense, Now Invoke The Goddess Isis using this Invocation:

"Isis of the moon
Thou who art all that ever was
All is this,
And all that shall be
come, veiled Queen of the night
Come as the scent of the sacred lotus,
Charging this circle With Love and Magick,
Do Thou descend upon our circle
On this most magick of nights!"

Now Invoke Hecate:

"O Night, Faithful preserver of mysteries,
and ye bright stars,
Whose golden beams with the moon succeed the fires of the day,
the three-fold Hecate
Who knowest our undertakings and comest to our aid when spells and arts we witches use,
I ask that you be present as I perform this work of retribution in your name,
Blessed Hecate, Be with me here"

Now, Chant the following:

"Forces of love, Hear me out,
Allow this spell to come true, without a doubt,
Let nothing and no one stand in my way,
As my mind is made, My heart is set,
This spell I shall say,
In no way shall this spell reverse,
Or place upon me any curse,
So mote it be"

Now you may start the spell.

The lotus incense should be burned out by now, if it is not, meditate on what you want this spell to do for you for the remainder of the stick of incense. The red candles, the chocolate candle, and the pink candle should already be anointed with the vanilla extract, if not, do so now. Light the rose stick incense. Also, take the envelope and set it where it is in range, you will be needing the envelope soon. Take the two red candles and the pin, inscribe your name and zodiac sign on one candle, and your lovers name and zodiac sign on the other candle, also inscribe runes of love on the candles. Also take the pictures and set them under the candles.

After doing this, chant the following, "To my lover, Dearest" take the candle with your lovers name and sign and put it on the far right side of your altar "Bound together I wish to be" then take the candle with your name and sign and put it on the far left side of your altar. "Eternal love and health I seek, our future bright and never bleak". Now take both candles and move them slowly to the middle of your altar as you chant the following:

"Open up be true to me,
love me deep and never flee,
Ill not hurt you ever or desert you,
we shall come together like the God and Goddess,
so let our love soar"

Now the candles should be touching and in the middle of your altar, take your charged wand and trace the infinity sign over the candles as you chant the following, passing the tip through the flames of the candles each time:

"Our feelings now intensify,
Never fear and never lie,
So we will stand the test of time,
for true love is not a crime,
and it to be truly told and done,
our loving wishes to be won"

Now, take the envelope, put the pictures in the envelope along with the first 5 herbs.
Take the parchment and write this love talisman on it with the Doves blood ink and feather

L A B A L E I N E

Now, light the rose cone incense and the chocolate candle. Place the talisman in the envelope and take the pictures out. Face the pictures so the faces are on each other, take the chocolate candle and using the wax, melt the pictures together, draw love runes on the back of the pictures. Place the pictures back in the envelope. take each of the remaining herbs, and hold them in your hand, one at a time, charging them with your intentions, then put the charged herbs in the envelope.

Take the rose quartz, and charge it with your power and intentions, rub it onto the outside of the envelope, Then take the quartz and put it aside. If the Rose incense cone isnt done burning, smother it out, then light the dragons blood cone. The two red candles should still be burning. As you now extinguish the two red candles chant the following:

"Though the candle doth go out,
This love shall never face doubt,
The couple candles that are us two,
burneth ever bright and true"

All of the herbs, and the pictures should be inside the envelope, now take a bit of your hair (not just a few strands, but not a big chunk, just a tiny lock) and put it inside of the envelope, now light the pink candle and close the envelope. The pink candle should be anointed with the Vanilla. Close the envelope. Now use the Pink candle and the chocolate candle to seal the envelope. After the envelope is sealed, hold it in your hands And charge it with your intentions. After this, burn The envelope while chanting the following:

"Almighty goddess hear my prayer!
Lord of fire, fulfill my desire, times three
it is meant to be
direct (name of lover)s love unto only me
this is my will, so mote it be"

Take the ashes, before blowing them into the wind, chant the following:

"Queen of the wind, I Beseech you again,
My spell, quite a feat, is now complete,
Please take these ashes of mine,
and carry them in no straight line,
Take these to venus, in her love,
Have her fulfill this desire which maketh me move,
I thank thee now, dearest friend,
My request is done, no more of thy time will I spend"

Now blow the ashes into the wind. Go back to your altar and dismiss the gods / goddesses you invoked using this chant:

"The kind fates have blessed my home,
The kind fates have blessed my heart,
The kind fates have blessed my loved ones,
I offer thanks with a humble heart,
I thank the goddess for my life,
I thank the goddess for my love,
I thank the goddess for continued blessings already on their way,
Merry meet,
Merry part,
and merry meet again,
So mote it be"

Extinguish and store all of the candles, store the herbs, dismiss your cast circle.
