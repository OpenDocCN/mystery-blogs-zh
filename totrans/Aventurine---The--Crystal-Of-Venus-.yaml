    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Witchy and Magickal. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/)
    or this article on how to make [crystal infused water](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-make-crystal-infused-water/).
    Today I thought we’d focus on a specific crystal, namely Aventurine.

- en: Aventurine is actually a type of quartz crystal but what sets it apart is that
    it’s covered in tiny inclusions which create a glittering surface called aventurescence.
    Its aventurescent sheen is caused by inclusions of mica, hematite, or goethite
    flecks that often give it a speckled appearance. Aventurine is actually named
    after the famous aventurine glass of Italy which mimics the glittering appearance
    of the naturally occurring mineral.

- en: Aventurine has been in use for millennia and the ancient Greeks described it
    as ‘having stars shining from within it’ and were prone to wear it as decorative
    jewellery. Archaeological finds have also discovered ancient axe heads made from
    aventurine.

    with a short mediation after which you should set the intention of what exactly
    you would like the spell to achieve.

- en: Step. 2\. Place the water into the saucepan and gently heat. Once the water
    is simmering add the sugar grains and the basil leaves. As the sugar dissolves
    in the water and the basil begins to release some of its etheric oils imagine
    your envy being released and sweetened.

    heat and allow the mixture to cool.

    Take your crystal into one hand and as you hold it drop a few droplets of the
    basil and sugar water into it. As the water droplets cover the surface of your
    aventurine crystal imagine a beautiful wave of cleansing green light washing over
    you and removing all of your feelings of envy or bitterness.

    of envy or bitterness has completely lifted from you. Thereafter cleanse your
    crystal, thank it for its guidance and store it in a safe place ready for use
    in your next spell
