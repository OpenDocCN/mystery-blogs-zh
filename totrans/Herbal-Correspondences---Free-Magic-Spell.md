Herb applies to a wide range of plants, including: grasses, trees, shrubs, weeds, roots, barks, and the flowers of any plant used for healing, magic spells and rituals, witchcraft, Wicca, or other purposes. Resins are concentrated, partially dehydrated derivatives of the liquid or sap of trees and plants and are commonly used in the same manner as herbs. Animal products like musk and ambergris are used similarly to resins and herbs, but primarily for their scents.

Herbs and their by-products have been used for thousands of years by humans and other animals for healing. Even lower life forms are familiar with the benefits gained through the ingestion or application of certain plants. Likewise with the magical aspects of herbs, only this use is limited to humans.
