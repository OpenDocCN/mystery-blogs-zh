You'll need at least one candle in the color you want to change your eyes to. You also need a pentacle. You can draw a pentacle if you don't have one.

One, two, three (color you have now) to (new color) I see.''

Take a deep cleansing breath while you envision yourself with the new eye color, then chant this three or more times:

''By the power of three, so mote it be.''

Again visualize your eyes changing from their original color to the new color, then check the mirror.
