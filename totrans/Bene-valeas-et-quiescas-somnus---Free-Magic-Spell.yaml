- en: 'At least, if you wanna practice spell, you must know the meaning. I just Translate:
    Bene=well/rightly/with good , valeas=be well, valetudo=health, quiescas=quiet,
    somnus=sleep (well good(health) & quiet sleep), venio=come, meum= my/mine (come
    to me/mine) mens=mind, agitare=move/shake/drive, molem/moles= Large mass, bulk,
    pile (the mind moves the mass). Please be understand, if you don''t know what
    is the meaning and you just do it, sometimes it could make graziness/insanity
    ,please give the translation english along with the spell, well if you make any
    spell again.'

- en: molem (last word) does not mean what is said? Or I am mistaken..

- en: I personally wouldn't use anything where the chanting is in Latin or another
    language not well understood by the caster. It is far too easy for the writer
    to misuse a written language they are not fluent in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again, if you do not speak a specific language, do not cast in that language,
    you will be too focused on the part you do not understand. That said, a soothing
    tea, relaxing/meditating before bed, then saying a chant similar to a lullaby
    does work. You just ground energy instead of charge it.
