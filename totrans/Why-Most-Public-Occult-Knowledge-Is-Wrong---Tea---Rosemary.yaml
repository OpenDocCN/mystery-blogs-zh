- en: Nowadays many occultists are throwing the word “occult” around. They generate
    a lot of clicks/views, but when you dig deeper into their teachings, there isn’t
    much there. But this doesn’t only happen with modern-day YouTube occultists. Many
    “old-school” occultists, even those part of secret societies like The Golden Dawn,
    purposefully wrote books that send you in the wrong direction, *away* from true
    initiation.

    itself. The word *occult* has many different definitions. **Some of the top definitions
    include:**

    a question that you don’t know the answer to? Google it. Want to know how to become

    come cheap**. Our world is filled with clickbait, and sure: there might be some
    tidbits of knowledge in the midst of it. But most of the deeper knowledge, the
    kind that has been around since Ancient Egypt, the knowledge at the basis of the
    ancient mysteries, can’t be found online.'

- en: Secret societies know this, which is why the initiation process into any secret
    society is so intense. And the people who *do* know don’t want it becoming public.
    You need to slowly initiate in order to integrate this knowledge. You might lose
    your mind if you tried to integrate it all at once. That’s why there’s a clear
    system for learning occult knowledge and why it’s so hidden. You have to *want*
    it and you have to *try*. You’ll be deceived in your journey over and over, and
    only the strongest will come out at the end.

    correct information and some information to throw you off the scent. They include
    rituals that work *and* inverted rituals that basically do the opposite of what
    you’re intending.

    Regardie, or others and felt like *some* of the information seemed off, then you
    know what I’m talking about.

- en: Nowadays, many pagans have developed the idea that learning about the occult
    is about being educated and following those who came before. About learning the
    occult techniques that are the most popular. Yet these techniques never worked
    for me. Eventually, I realized that true knowledge is hidden between the lines.
    Sure, it’s in plain sight, but it’s something you have to *search* for. You won’t
    find occult knowledge spelled out in a book, but you will find the real truth
    hidden between the lines of the book in symbols.

- en: You won’t be given anything for free during occult initiation. If something
    is easily accessible, consider that part of it may be false. This is simply the
    paradigm we live in; to truly initiate, you must push through all those barriers
    and find your truth. Nothing worthwhile comes easy.
