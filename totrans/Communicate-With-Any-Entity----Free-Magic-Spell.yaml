    number each page. When youve done that, stimulate your mind. Think of love or
    a favorite song if you want. When you think you are stimulated, from the bottom
    of your heart ask yourself, "How stimulated am i on a scale 1-10" You should feel
    an answer come to you, if you are an 8 or higher, thats perfect. Now in the book
    write "I'd like to communicate with an entity (whatever you want to know about.
    ) For example I want to communicate with an entity that has telekinesis." Now
    write, "are you there?" An answer comes to you, write it down. Now ask it's name.
    Again write it down. Continue asking it whatever questions you want. When you
    are done, write, you are dismissed.

- en: I would say... right idea, wrong process. What is being described here is commonly
    referred to as 'automatic writing'. This is a form of channelling/mediumship where
    the idea is to open one's unconscious/subconscious awareness and give it (and
    any entities who wish to operate through you) a means of expression.

- en: The magic isn't in the book, or how you prepare the book. It comes from yourself
    and your mental state. The goal should be to use meditation and relaxation to
    become calm and open to the idea of allowing your hand and arm to be controlled
    by outside ideas and efforts.

- en: Place a pen or pencil into your hand, rest your arm on the table, with your
    hand on the page. Imagine it floppy and soft like a cooked noodle. If you feel
    tension or an urge to move your hand, fingers, wrist, or arm allow it to move.
    Lightly scribble or draw small spirals or circles to create some movement if you
    want, then allow intuition and subconscious urging to take over.

- en: It is also generally helpful to not look at your hand or the page, or do so
    as little as possible (such as to landmark/ move to a different place on the page).
    Watching what is going on makes the conscious mind try to make sense of and/or
    control the motion, effectively letting the conscious mind get in the way.
