- en: Athena is the Greek goddess of wisdom, strategy and just war. She was considered
    a mentor of heroes and worshiped as patroness of Athens, where the Parthenon was
    built to worship her. She was associated by the Etruscans with its goddess Menrva,
    and later by the Romans with [Minerva](https://spells8.com/minerva-devotional/).
