# Replacement ritual of the overseer dragon

*THIS RITUAL IS AN ILLEGAL ACT IN ALL SECTIONS OF THE MILKEY WAY* This ritual allows you to draw power from the Overseer, who is the one who controls the universe. The spell is typically used if the previous overseer's heir can't, for any reason, be the overseer, so it's given to the second trusted member of the royalty under CAREFULLY WATCHED CIRCUMSTANCES. If you are not heir to the Overseer, the power may override your system

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your wit. This may actually kill you

*   -dragon blood

*   -hands

*   -a general knowledge of dragons

*   -a mirror (optional. Only for checking if you're doing things right)

*   -a wide space (theres an explosion that happens)

*   -a wide space (theres an explosion that happens)

Dip your middle finger and index finger on both hands into the dragon blood, which will officially start the ritual. Cross both pairs of fingers above your head, then circle them around you. Once 45 degrees to your standing legs, spread out your hands. If successful, a large golden ring with little spokes should pulse from behind you (the mirror would come in handy here).

The golden ring should maintain behind you. Bring your hands together into a clap, then rotate your arms in opposite directions until you have them completely spread out horizontally. Then, move your arms counterclockwise to a vertical stance, and then bring them together in front of you, clapping

Now here's the tricky part. If you gotten this far, you should now be taking in power. Keep your hands clasped together for as long as you can. After about thirty seconds, the ring should dissapear. If you can seperate your hands without literally blowing up, you did it!

Some side effects include:
Extreme nausea
Sight problems
And transformation into a multitude of things (if you are a human trying this out, you will almost cirtainly transform into a dragon)

Also, the drawing of the power may cause an overload to your system, which could cause you to turn into magical space dust in a fraction of a second. Be careful

thanks for the laugh, no spell is ''illegal'' just personally disapproved of. you cannot physically transform, even if you own Dragons blood and have a general knowledge of Dragons [heck, i should be able to transform come to think of it] above all, if this ''spell'' is so illegal, powerful, dangerous, and real, why would it be so easy to find? many groups hide advanced information from others for a reason, specifically the person isn't ready for whatever reason and its dangerous, so if this was real, and some powerful being doesn't want you using it, why post it openly on this website?

First line, you can tell this is fake after the first line. No spell is ''an illegal act in all sections of the milky way.'' Real Magic is not policed by anyone but yourself. Should you deem a spell ''morally wrong'' then do not cast. Otherwise, you can cast any working spell you desire. This is fake.
