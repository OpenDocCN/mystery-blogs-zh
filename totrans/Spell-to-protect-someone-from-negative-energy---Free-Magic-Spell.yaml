    Turn off the lights. Sit in a spot on the floor and prop a pillow up against your
    back. Rest your hands on your knees and meditate. (for 2 mins.) Then close your
    eyes while picturing the person you want/need to protect. Now picture yourself
    helping them up from the ground in which they''ve fallen. Picture you taking them
    back home. Open you''re eyes and say this spell 2x: In which is in desperate need
    ______ (their name) shall be protected by me. I cast this spell to make the things
    go away. Vanish. They no longer need to fear the other side of this road. Because
    it ends here. I am the one to protect thy, therefore SO MOTE IT BE! Soon enough
    it should work, have faith in the power within you. Believe you CAN do it because
    you really can.'
