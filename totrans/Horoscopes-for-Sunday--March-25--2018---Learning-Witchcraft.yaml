    to who need some assistance or for those who suffer all over the world. So what
    can you do of a practical nature? You can start getting more personally involved.

    at what you have to do with a clear head, free from bias and favoritism, they
    won’t be too challenging. Others will appreciate your fairness and honesty.

    so it’s important that you look clearly at the situations you are involved in
    and make an effort to act logically rather than emotionally. Be careful with money
    too.

    knowledge this week. There is no point trying to deny it is true, so you might
    as well own up and admit that, yes, you are responsible. It’s not such a big deal.

    the most sensitive area of your chart, but don’t put up the shutters completely
    because there could be a new love interest coming your way. Be open to new experiences.

    be much you can do about it. Take life as it comes and don’t take it personally
    if people mess you about and keep you waiting. It’s not as if you’ve never done
    it yourself.

    cheer up and don’t act as if the world is against you, because it isn’t. Your
    mind creates your reality – always – so think happy and feel happy and soon you
    will be happy too.

    it so why waste time and energy beating yourself up about what might have been?
    The rest of your life starts right here and now, so draw a line and start moving
    forward.

    is a danger that a rival will lure you into saying too much about a controversial
    issue in the hope that it will make you look bad. Keep your opinions to yourself
    for now.

    week to come as well. You have chopped and changed far too much in recent weeks
    and now need a period of certainty. Others need to know where you stand as well.

    fault you are feeling out of sorts. If you want to improve your mood try focussing
    on something you can do on your own that lightens your mood. Watched any good
    films lately?

    you will have to react to events in a way that makes those plans redundant. Adopt
    a mindset that allows you to change direction at a moment’s notice.

    follow the party line you could bring down a storm on your head. Don’t rock the
    boat.
