  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though many people aren’t aware of angel numbers when they appear, they
    can provide a great deal of guidance to those who are receptive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people believe angel numbers to be divine intervention, with messages sent
    to protect and guide you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that angel numbers *can* be sent by your angels, but they can also be
    sent by your guides, by Source, by higher dimensional levels of your soul, by
    past or future versions of yourself, and even by the energy in the Universe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**But how is this possible?** Every number has a specific *energetic* vibration,
    so the numerology meanings of numbers are more literal than you may realize. These
    meanings come from the specific frequency of the number. That’s why it’s easy
    for our guides, angels, or higher self to send messages via numbers: the frequency *already* matches
    the number. These aren’t just random descriptions but are actually the frequency
    of the number you’re seeing!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll be able to tell if you’re seeing an angel number when its recurrences
    go beyond coincidence. As you keep seeing the exact same number on license plates
    or clocks, the odds become increasingly unlikely that the number would appear
    again, yet there it is. This is a clear example of an angel number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angels, guides, and our souls often communicate in symbolic ways, which is one
    of the reasons why angel numbers are so popular. It’s hard to miss numbers that
    show up over and over, unlike more vague symbols and signs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, these moments offer some kind of guidance, as with any form of communication
    from spirit guides. Whether you realize it or not, you will see these signs during
    pivotal moments in your life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angel numbers are symbolic of more than just their numerical values. Angel numbers
    give us insight into our lives through divine intervention. There is a specific,
    scientific meaning to every number, so angel numbers, like Tarot cards, are another
    method of divination.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea is that each number has a vibrational energy or frequency that goes
    beyond its numerical value. When you see an angel number, you can know that the
    number appeared because of the *frequency* of the message, not just because someone
    arbitrarily decided on a meaning for that specific number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any specific angel number only shows up over and over because you have not yet
    understood the meaning. Once you understand the meaning and assimilate the lesson
    into your life, you most likely won’t see the number as often.

    this can be a sign that your angels are trying to reach out to you. However, it’s
    up to you to interpret the *meaning* of this sign and follow what your angels
    are telling you.
  prefs: []

    or signs of congratulations. In my experience, whether the Angel Number message
    is dire or positive, there is always some advice you can use to improve your situation.

    about change, flexibility, and curiosity. The vibration of the number definitely
    doesn’t like to sit still!
  prefs: []

    from the mundane (the human senses) to the spiritual. It also represents bringing
    what you’ve learned forward as you move into a new era, a new way of thinking.

    that there is a major transformation or shift occurring. It shows that someone
    is entering into a new phase of life or even a multi-dimensional way of thinking.
    These are massive energetic shifts!

    adventures and unexpected opportunities are just on the horizon, it *doesn’t* necessarily
    mean that these experiences will be easy.

    through pain. After all, change is always hard. However, the numerology of 555
    shows that these changes are necessary and for the best, even if they feel *very* extreme
    at the time.

    is often a warning, regardless of whether the change is good or bad.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that spirit guides like to let us know when something big will happen.
    They use symbols as a way to prepare our subconscious and unconscious minds so
    that we’re not caught *completely* off-guard. Angel number 555 is one of the most
    common indicators that something seriously big is about to change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you need further clarification (and this scenario for angel number 555 rings
    true), consider doing a tarot or astrology reading. You can do a simple past-present-future
    spread with the tarot to give you more insight into this upcoming change, or you
    can take a look at your solar return chart to determine precisely what kind of
    change is coming in your life.
  prefs: []

    through the lessons you learn.** Typically, angel number 555 indicates that this
    change is happening for a reason, to teach you something that you *need* to learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    within you. Focus on manifesting the change in a way that works for you. Don’t
    block the energy but work *with* it.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    This isn’t something that will just fall into your lap but is something you must
    consciously choose to alter in your life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this rings true, then you probably already know what area of your life needs
    a switch-up. Most likely, you’ll see angel number 555 if you’ve been feeling stuck
    or *done* with someone in your life, so this won’t be a huge surprise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In this scenario, angel number 555 is telling you to go for it. Don’t wait:
    things won’t get better on their own. It’s only by taking your own actions that
    you can enact positive change in your life.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might see angel number 555 if you’ve been on the fence about something.
    Maybe you *want* to leave your job but aren’t sure if you should, or perhaps you
    want to start or end a relationship. Maybe you’re considering a physical move.
    Or maybe you’re thinking about something even smaller, like getting a pet, switching
    something up in your home, changing your personal style, or starting a new hobby.
    Whatever the case, angel number 555 is telling you that you *need* to go for it,
    both to change your physical life for the better *and* for your soul’s growth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that 555 is the number that signifies “leveling up.” As the halfway
    point between 1 and 9, 5 is a pivotal number for soul growth. In this scenario,
    angel number 555 indicates that it’s time to make the jump in order to move forward
    in a *big* way, whether or not you realize this.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to other people or that you *have* to do certain things for others. This could
    be a physical debt of any kind or emotional debt. Or maybe you’re stuck in a different
    situation due to your own morals or beliefs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whatever the case, angel number 555 is a clear message that you need to *break
    free from the chains that bind you*. Your guides are telling you that now is the
    time to do this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, angel number 555 is a sign that you need to break free of physical
    addictions. Whether you’re addicted to alcohol, drugs, food, your phone, or even
    something else (something specific to you), your guides are telling you that you
    now have the strength to break free if you choose. You are waking up and forming
    a strong connection with your soul, but this process will be impossible to complete
    if you don’t first address your addictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that addictions or anything “binding” is all a low-level frequency.
    When you see angel number 555, you’re receiving a message that it’s time to ascend
    to a higher frequency, so you must leave behind anything that does not serve you
    in your journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'And yes: it’s *hard* to break away. But luckily, angel number 555 is also a
    sign that your angels or guides are here to help you. All you need to do is *ask*
    and they will send answers your way. Your **inner power** is what will help you
    break free, but your guides and angels are always around to help strengthen this
    inner power and to show you the way to break free.'

  prefs:

- en: Similar to “breaking away” from your chains, angel number 555 *also* indicates
    that now is the time to choose true freedom.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you feel trapped or enslaved in any way, then this is a sign that you need
    to look more closely at your life and find a way *out*. We all have the potential
    to gain freedom in our lifetimes but this is something we must manifest ourselves.
    Most of us are not *born* into ultimate freedom.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The number 5 represents freedom by itself, so 555’s number meaning is freedom
    x 3\. Often, this indicates *spiritual* freedom rather than physical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at spiritual leaders throughout the ages, from various religions,
    you’ll notice that many of them were harmed or enslaved physically, yet they maintained
    their sense of spiritual freedom. During a really intense time in our world right
    now when we need to be more aware than ever of spiritual freedom, it’s not surprising
    that you’re seeing angel number 555.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ask yourself if you feel spiritually free. Are you able to sense and channel
    your own power? Or do you feel like something is blocking you from accessing your
    true self?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We all have an innate right to spiritual freedom, but that doesn’t mean that
    it’s something we have naturally from birth. Because we are in human bodies and
    because there are people who *don’t* want us to access this unlimited power within
    ourselves, spiritual freedom is something we have to search for and consciously
    develop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that you were created to be free. It could be helpful to work on raising
    your frequency/vibration so that you’re able to discern what true freedom is,
    since angel number 555 is sometimes a sign that you’re looking for freedom in
    the wrong place.

    piece of wisdom. This is usually a message from your soul.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    way about a person or situation but ignored your gut instinct? Does something
    feel wrong or off but you can’t figure out why?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    This is not only important in this specific situation but will also help to raise
    your frequency and enable you to tap into your spiritual intuition on a more regular
    basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember: **your body *always* knows.** If you have been feeling anxious about
    something, don’t brush it off. There’s something there! Anxiety is a sign from
    our bodies (and our souls via physical indicators) that there’s something we need
    to look at, something to pay attention to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Trust yourself before anyone else. While you might not know exactly *why* you
    feel anxious, down, or wrong, it’s important that you don’t ignore the signals.
    Ask your spirit guides or your angels for answers. Ask to receive the knowledge
    you seek in life or in your dreams. Trust me: once you open yourself up, you’ll
    get the answers you need. But always start with the initial feeling and trust
    what your body is telling you.'

    to enter into a new spiritual “era.” This must be consciously done and is now
    necessary at this point in your soul’s evolution. You’re ready to raise your frequency
    in a massive way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right now, you’re hovering on the precipice. If you keep seeing angel number
    555, it’s a sign that you need to continue to work on your frequency so that you
    can enter a new dimension.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your divine power is *within* you, but you cannot access your full potential
    until you’re vibrating at a certain frequency. There could be very specific things
    in your life that are keeping you low such as food, addictions, certain relationships,
    or specific beliefs. I recommend that you delve deeper into the science of frequency
    and learn about ways to raise it (and I mean specific ways here, not just “love
    and light”).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s time to embrace a new way of spiritual thinking. Maybe you need to meditate
    more or connect with deities. Maybe it’s time to admit the truth about something
    to yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that your frequency isn’t something that changes just through “spiritual”
    work. True spirituality, or a high frequency, comes from those little day-to-day
    interactions. It isn’t a hobby but a way of life. Your spirituality is quite simply
    who you *are* inside. There aren’t certain prayers, meditations, or mantras that
    will do the trick. Focus on what works for *you* to raise your vibration in the
    most authentic way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right now, you’re entering into a time when you have the opportunity to “level
    up” your spiritual self, or your energy, in a massive way. Focus on what feels
    good to you and on what feels high-vibrational. Your angels and guides are reaching
    out to tell you that they’re ready to support your growth!

    discovering new things about your partner. Either way, now is the time to make
    the massive energetic shift needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    frequencies. Now, you need to work to transmute this energy and “graduate” to
    the higher frequencies as a couple.

    And don’t panic: this isn’t always the case! However, if this explanation does

    current relationship/way of life no longer serves your spiritual growth. You’re
    leveling up here.'

    people.
  prefs: []

    whatever you want. Because you’ve recently “leveled up” energetically, *you* can
    manifest the partner you desire. You certainly don’t have to sit around waiting
    for someone else to do it for you.
