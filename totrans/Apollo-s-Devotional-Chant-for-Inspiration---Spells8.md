# Apollo’s Devotional Chant for Inspiration – Spells8

> 来源：[https://spells8.com/apollo-devotional/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/apollo-devotional/#0001-01-01)

In Greek and Roman mythology, Apollo is a standout god, born to Zeus and Leto and twin to the huntress [Artemis](https://spells8.com/artemis-devotional/). Over time, Apollo and the sun god [Helios](https://spells8.com/helios-devotional/) started to blend in people’s minds, similar to how Artemis got linked with [Selene](https://spells8.com/selene-devotional/), the moon goddess. Despite this confusion in religious circles, myths and literature always kept Apollo and Helios, as well as Artemis and Selene, separate. The Etruscans also honored him as Aplu, showing Apollo’s wide-reaching influence in ancient cultures.

Come blessed healer,

Bearing a golden lyre, generative, agrarian, Oracular one,

Wild, radiant divinity, lovely one, glorious son,

Cultivator of joy, whose arrows achieve their aim, mighty archer.

You who achieve from afar, prophet, holy one,

all-seeing eye bringing the light which shines on mortals,

Golden-haired, making clear oracular utterances,

Hear me with gracious soul as I pray on behalf of mankind.

Upon the blessed earth you look from above through the dark of night.

In the restful shadow of a night filled with stars,

You clearly see the root below and you arrange and support the boundary of all:

For the origin and completion are both in your care,   

The cause of the blooming of all things,

with your resonant lyre you command the axis of the heavens,

Placing all in harmony, by which, indeed, you advance to the lowest pitch,

Elsewhere to the highest, at times playing in the Dorian mode,

Tempering all the poles you keep the tribes of living creatures distinct.

Let inspiration come to me.

Support my quest for creativity.

Make my imagination unlimited.

And my mind open to new ideas as I manifest my talents.

Let me surround myself with creative people.

So I can be in touch with my creative source.

Help me release any resistance to fully expressing my creativity.

Give me the time to think, to relax and focus.

Powerful spirit, express yourself in all possible ways.

Let inspiration flow so that I can easily express myself.

My creative work fills you with joy,

And anything can be my source of inspiration.

I promise to always look out for new experiences.

To recognize and overcome my limitations.

If you eliminate all mental blockages, remove barriers,

And any habits that oppress my inspiration.

Dear Apollo, come to me.

You have mingled harmony into the share of all mortal men,   

Giving each an equal measure of winter and summer,

The highest three strings in the winter, the lowest in the summer,

The Dorian mode produces the lovely and blooming spring.

Thereupon the mortals celebrate and call you lord and

Pan, the two-horned God who sends the whistling winds,   

Wherefore you form and bear the seal of the entire Cosmos.

Hear, happy one, the supplicating voices of the initiates and save them.
