    All you have to have is a candle, simply casting yourself a protective space or
    circle, bringing yourself into a meditative state while envisioning your desires
    coming true. Once you end up with a clear image in your mind, you light the candle.
    Once the candle begins burning, energy is released to call your desire towards
    you.
