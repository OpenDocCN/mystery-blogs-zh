    items for this spell:** First, you should find a place where you feel comfortable,
    safe, and at peace.  This can be anywhere, so long as you feel safe in this place. 
    It''s best to not have any distractions (ie. light, noise, movement, sounds, etc.),
    but you can work around the distractions.  You can also find your energy in a
    place where you''re uncomfortable, but it''s much easier to find inner energy
    in a place where you are comfortable.'

    If you're uncomfortable in this position, you may change your position to something
    you're more comfortable with.  Try your best to relax before attempting to find
    your energy.

    travel through your shoulders, your stomach, your legs, arms, hands, feet, until
    it reaches your toes and fingertips.  The energy will fizz here, and you''ll have
    to color it.  Coloring your energy is simple: The first color that comes to mind
    while you''re attempting this exercise is most likely the color of your energy. 
    If this color doesn''t feel right, think of a different color.  The color of your
    energy can be your favorite color or the color of your couch.  Remember to accept
    this color -- it is your energy, and the more you accept it, the more you can
    utilize it.'
