    altars, in fire spells, and in many other rituals.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An athame is often used in modern times to refer to any ceremonial/ritual dagger
    or knife. For us, it is a ceremonial blade used in Wicca religion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people take a harder line on the definition and require that the blade
    be double-edged and the handle black.

    take the looser view following the central philosophy of this site:'

    books on the revival of Wicca in modern days try to track these things down, but
    they often conflict due to the sparse amount of primary source material.

  prefs: []

    don’t think it’s all that important. Since you aren’t using an athame for cutting,
    things like “slipping” and “grip” don’t matter very much.

    choice for someone looking to use it in air, divination, and protection spells.

    this end of the spectrum if you’d like to use it in fire, love, or sex spells.
