Thank you it really worked

It did not, physical transformation isn't real. Magick doesn't contradict nature.

Damn dude you really love telling people what magick can and can't do and just forget about mythology and creatures jesussss

Magic cannot go against the laws of nature. Magic only brings natural change. These are well known facts, and anyone who knows anything about real Magic will tell you the exact same thing; physical transformation is not possible with real Magic. You can call on these spirits and work with them in your craft, but you will never become one. You were born human, you will live as a human, and die as a human. In your next lifetime you may become a mermaid, a cat, grass, or another human, but in this lifetime accept the reality you are human.
