    power from one primarily. This is the element of your soul. This spell will help
    you clarify which element your draw from.

    or index finger). Once your circle is cast, place the red candle to the south
    on the edge of the circle, the brown candle to the north, the blue candle to the
    west and lastly the white candle to the east. Light the candles in a clockwise
    motion, starting with the candle of your choice saying the names, either out loud
    or in your thoughts, of the elements they represent. Once all candles have been
    lit seat yourself(or stand if you prefer) in the middle. With your item of power/protection
    in hand, recite this incantation:'

- en: This is overkill. While, yes, we are all the elements, and we are naturally
    drawn to one more than another, you do not need all of this. Quickest way to figure
    it out, ask yourself what your favourite element is. If you have more than one,
    that is fine. Second thing you can do is Google your zodiac and see which element
    rules your sign. Third option, make a list of your qualities and interests, then
    Google what each element represents. No spell required.
