    This is NOT a spell of black magic, as you are only defending yourself. I created
    this spell and it has always worked for me.

- en: Focusing all of your anger and punching someone is not a spell. It would work,
    you would punch them really, really hard, but it is not a spell. Also, do not
    punch people. Even if it is a bully. I understand self defense, you are being
    attacked and need to stop the attacker. Punching someone for revenge is not self
    defense.
