    Many people merely believe the form created by children’s tales or television
    shows and these are rarely accurate depictions of the craft. In addition, individuals
    will often use these falsehoods as seemingly accurate information when sharing
    “knowledge” about witchcraft making witches seem evil or strange.

- en: First and foremost, not all witches are female and it is possible to find **male
    witches** across the globe. While many males who practice witchcraft, especially
    contemporary young adult males, prefer to refer to themselves as wizards they
    are still practicing the craft. In Old English the term ‘Wicca’ traditionally
    meant sorcerer or male wizard and ‘wicce’ meant sorceress or female witch; however,
    over the years witch become the collective term.

- en: '[fsbProduct asin=’0738713031′ size=’300′ align=’right’] It is important to
    note that Wicca and witchcraft are two separate entities. By saying they are the
    same thing and merely synonymous is like saying Buddhists and welders are the
    same. Witchcraft is a type of craft or skill, such as painting or cooking. It
    can be learned and practiced by any individual who is willing to follow the instructions.
    However, Wicca is a form of religion or belief. It was developed in the 1950s
    by a man named Gerald Gardner and has been followed by various people ever since.
    It is vital to note that not all individuals in the Wicca religion are witches,
    only some are while others are not.'

- en: Witches do not worship Satan. In fact, true or real witches do not even believe
    in the existence of Satan. This is due to the fact that Satan is a construction
    of the Christian religion and to believe in this construct you must be a Christian
    who believes in God. Both female and male witches do not follow a Christian faith.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As is mentioned above, witches do not believe in Christianity; thus, they do
    not believe in Satan. Pagan is derived from the work ‘paganus’ meaning rural peasant
    or villager. The term morphed from the meaning of ‘not believing in God or Christianity’.
    By not believing in Christianity, it is not possible for the pagans to believe
    in Satan as He is a construct of the Christian faith.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pentagram is a symbol dating back as far as 3000 BC and has an astrological
    meaning by representing the planets Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, and Venus.
    As it has appeared in various cultures and has been represented by many groups,
    it is not exclusively related to one element or construct. Yes, it is true that
    the Christian faith does have a special or sacred meaning for the pentagram symbol;
    however, it does not represent Satan but rather the five sense and the five wounds
    of Christ. In Witchcraft, it has been noted that the pentagram has retained the
    astrological representation pointing toward the heavens and representing the five
    elements of earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. True witches, however, do not
    recognize the pentagon at all.
