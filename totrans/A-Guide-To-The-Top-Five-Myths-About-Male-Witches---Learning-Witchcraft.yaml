    Many people merely believe the form created by children’s tales or television
    shows and these are rarely accurate depictions of the craft. In addition, individuals
    will often use these falsehoods as seemingly accurate information when sharing
    “knowledge” about witchcraft making witches seem evil or strange.

  zh: 1\. 所有的女巫都是女性
- en: First and foremost, not all witches are female and it is possible to find **male
    witches** across the globe. While many males who practice witchcraft, especially
    contemporary young adult males, prefer to refer to themselves as wizards they
    are still practicing the craft. In Old English the term ‘Wicca’ traditionally
    meant sorcerer or male wizard and ‘wicce’ meant sorceress or female witch; however,
    over the years witch become the collective term.

  zh: 首先，不是所有的女巫都是女性，全球范围内可以找到**男巫**。虽然许多从事巫术的男性，特别是现代年轻成年男性，更倾向于称自己为巫师，但他们仍在从事这门艺术。在古英语中，术语"Wicca"传统上指巫师或男巫，"wicce"指女巫或女巫；然而，多年来，女巫成为了集体术语。

  zh: 2\. 真正的女巫是女巫教徒
- en: '[fsbProduct asin=’0738713031′ size=’300′ align=’right’] It is important to
    note that Wicca and witchcraft are two separate entities. By saying they are the
    same thing and merely synonymous is like saying Buddhists and welders are the
    same. Witchcraft is a type of craft or skill, such as painting or cooking. It
    can be learned and practiced by any individual who is willing to follow the instructions.
    However, Wicca is a form of religion or belief. It was developed in the 1950s
    by a man named Gerald Gardner and has been followed by various people ever since.
    It is vital to note that not all individuals in the Wicca religion are witches,
    only some are while others are not.'

  zh: '[fsbProduct asin=’0738713031′ size=’300′ align=’right’] 需要注意的是，女巫教和巫术是两个不同的实体。说它们是同一回事，仅仅是同义词，就像说佛教徒和焊接工人是一样的。巫术是一种技艺或技能，如绘画或烹饪。任何愿意遵循指导的个人都可以学习和实践它。然而，女巫教是一种宗教或信仰形式。它在20世纪50年代由一个名叫杰拉尔德·加德纳的人发展起来，并自那时起被各种人群所追随。需要注意的是，并非所有女巫教信仰者都是女巫，只有一些人是，而其他人则不是。'

  zh: 3\. 真正的女巫崇拜撒旦
- en: Witches do not worship Satan. In fact, true or real witches do not even believe
    in the existence of Satan. This is due to the fact that Satan is a construction
    of the Christian religion and to believe in this construct you must be a Christian
    who believes in God. Both female and male witches do not follow a Christian faith.

  zh: 女巫并不崇拜撒旦。事实上，真正的女巫甚至不相信撒旦的存在。这是因为撒旦是基督教的一种构造，要相信这种构造，你必须是一个信仰上帝的基督徒。无论是女性还是男性的女巫，都不信奉基督教信仰。

  zh: 4\. 番薯女巫是撒旦教徒
- en: As is mentioned above, witches do not believe in Christianity; thus, they do
    not believe in Satan. Pagan is derived from the work ‘paganus’ meaning rural peasant
    or villager. The term morphed from the meaning of ‘not believing in God or Christianity’.
    By not believing in Christianity, it is not possible for the pagans to believe
    in Satan as He is a construct of the Christian faith.

  zh: 正如上文所提到的，女巫不信奉基督教；因此，她们也不信仰撒旦。 "Pagan"一词源于拉丁词"paganus"，意为乡村农民或村民。该术语的含义从"不信奉上帝或基督教"演变而来。不信奉基督教的人，自然也不可能信仰撒旦，因为撒旦是基督教信仰的构造物。

  zh: 5\. 五角星是撒旦的标志
- en: The pentagram is a symbol dating back as far as 3000 BC and has an astrological
    meaning by representing the planets Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, and Venus.
    As it has appeared in various cultures and has been represented by many groups,
    it is not exclusively related to one element or construct. Yes, it is true that
    the Christian faith does have a special or sacred meaning for the pentagram symbol;
    however, it does not represent Satan but rather the five sense and the five wounds
    of Christ. In Witchcraft, it has been noted that the pentagram has retained the
    astrological representation pointing toward the heavens and representing the five
    elements of earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. True witches, however, do not
    recognize the pentagon at all.

  zh: 五角星是一个可以追溯到公元前3000年的符号，具有星相学意义，代表着木星、水星、火星、土星和金星这些行星。它出现在多个文化中，并被许多团体所代表，不专属于某一个元素或构造。是的，基督教确实对五角星符号有特殊或神圣的意义；然而，它并不代表撒旦，而是代表基督的五官和五伤。在巫术中，已经注意到五角星保留了指向天空的星相象征，并代表地、空气、火、水和灵魂这五大元素。然而，真正的巫师完全不认同五边形。
