- en: Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of curse-breaking, it’s crucial to understand
    what curses are and how they work. Curses are negative intentions or energies
    directed at someone with the intent of causing harm, misfortune, or suffering.
    They are often fueled by strong emotions, jealousy, anger, or resentment.

    but you might be surprised to know that even a simple verbal “curse” can have
    negative effects depending on how strong the sender’s energy is. But still: magical
    curses are typically the hardest to break because they have the *most* directed
    energy and intention behind them.'

    essentially removing their hold over you or the target. Surprisingly, curses *aren’t*
    super hard to break. Nope: a curse-breaking ritual is just another spell.'

    or if you suspect someone might have cast a hex on you. Signs of curses can include
    unexplained accidents, persistent bad luck, health issues, or feeling unusually
    drained.

    the curse is (if possible) and who cursed you. You’ll know you’re right because
    you’ll have a gut feeling, especially since the curse is attached to *you*.

    can help remove the negative energy associated with the curse.

    a more complex curse, then you’ll need to perform a ritual. I still recommend
    starting with a cleansing before the ritual.

    spell, but you’ll need to know who cursed you.

    person who cursed you. You’ll put the photo into the box during a ritual and seal
    it with the intention that any magic they’ve cast rebounds upon them. This is
    a SUPER effective spell but again, you need to know for *sure* who cast the curse.
