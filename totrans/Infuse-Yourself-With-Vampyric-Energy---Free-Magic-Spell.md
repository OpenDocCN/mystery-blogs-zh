At precisely 11:30 at night:

Light the incense and let it burn halfway. Drop your blood on the incense (it's OK if it goes out but it probably won't).

Chant:
''My lot in life is killing me,
My will to change to what cannot be,
Is ever consuming my striving soul,
But now I think I can pay the toll.
My lot in death is changing me.
This is my will, so mote it be.

Chant this once and scatter the incense outside.
