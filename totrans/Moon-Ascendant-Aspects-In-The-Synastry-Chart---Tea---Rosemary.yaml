    and protective instincts. Clearly, the moon is an important planet in relationships
    and therefore in synastry charts.

    aspect. The ascendant changes sign so quickly that this is truly an important

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The moon conjunct ascendant synastry relationship is definitely emotional, especially
    for the moon individual. The ascendant person will naturally trigger a lot of
    deeply held emotions in the moon person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the ascendant person won’t even realize that they’re doing this – they
    are simply being themselves. It’s just their way of presenting themselves that
    will trigger the moon person and cause them to *react*. Most likely, this is because
    the ascendant person specifically triggers the moon person’s deeply held childhood
    insecurities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    feel inside. The moon might *feel* the way the ascendant person *acts* but they
    don’t show it.

    synastry aspect promotes emotional comfort in a relationship. Instead, this aspect
    usually triggers the moon.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there can be some pros to this moon conjunct ascendant synastry relationship.
    The moon completely understands *why* the ascendant wears that mask because they
    understand the emotions behind it. So when the ascendant person puts on their
    mask, when they feel uncomfortable, the moon person may be the only who truly
    understands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the moon individual is able to work through the triggers that are presented
    by the ascendant, then they can be uniquely suited to understand that ascendant’s
    inner emotions. However, if the moon person is consistently being triggered by
    their own emotional landscape (usually if they haven’t dealt with their childhood
    hurts), then they will not be able to see beyond their own pain.

- en: The moon trine ascendant synastry aspect is harmonious. Typically, the ascendant
    person feels comfortable around the moon person regardless of how well they know
    each other. There isn’t any awkwardness when they first meet because the moon
    person just *gets* the ascendant person’s mask.
  prefs: []

- en: Conversation will usually flow between these two, even if neither is especially
    outgoing. The moon trine ascendant synastry aspect is an easy one and is supportive
    in any relationship since the moon person especially understands the ascendant
    person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The impact of this moon trine ascendant synastry aspect will depend on how the
    ascendant person acts in conversation. If the ascendant person is quite outgoing,
    then this will feel less impactful. However, if the ascendant person has a “quieter”
    mask, then this easy flow between the two people will feel much more important.

    individual; instead, they’re able to sense the emotions of the ascendant person
    and put them at ease.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The moon sextile ascendant synastry aspect means that the moon person has the *opportunity*
    to understand the emotions behind the ascendant’s mask. They can learn why the
    ascendant person presents themselves in a certain way and can figure out what
    emotions are hiding under that mask.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be a great aspect in a relationship because, *if* the moon person is
    willing to dive in and truly understand the ascendant person, they can become
    a source of emotional support. This is especially helpful in large groups when
    the ascendant person feels the need to don their mask.
  prefs: []

    As the moon person learns more about the ascendant person’s emotional landscape
    and why they present themselves a certain way, the relationship will flow more
    easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a caretaker. They can *support* the ascendant’s emotions without trying to *fix*
    them.
  prefs: []

    an *opportunity*. If the moon person does not engage, then this aspect will not
    be activated.

- en: The moon opposition ascendant synastry aspect can actually be quite beneficial.
    The moon represents the shadow side of the ascendant person, meaning that the
    moon person intuitively understands the deeper, darker, hidden emotions of the
    ascendant person, the feelings that others don’t see. For that reason, this relationship
    can feel a bit like a soul connection, as though these two have known each other
    before.

    that the moon is able to see these deep emotions. Once they have integrated their
    shadow side, they have a *lot* to discuss and always feel supported by the

- en: This can go a few ways. If the ascendant person is evolved, then they will probably
    appreciate this about the moon. Once they have integrated their shadow side they
    will have a lot to discuss with the moon and will feel supported in showing this
    new side of themselves because the moon person just gets it. They will be able
    to slowly reveal their deepest emotions to the moon and feel understood and supported.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if the ascendant hasn’t done any work to integrate their shadow side
    and is actively running from those deeper emotions, then they might be annoyed
    or triggered every time they glimpse their shadow through the moon. They will
    either snap in anger or run (fight or flight).

- en: Typically, the moon opposition ascendant synastry aspect indicates that the
    ascendant person sees the moon as the ideal partner in some ways, or at least
    the *archetype* of their own personal ideal partner. This is because the descendant
    represents the ideal parter as well as the shadow self. The longevity of this
    relationship will depend on how comfortable the ascendant person is with their
    own shadow side that is reflected in the moon.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important in the moon opposite ascendant synastry relationship that the
    moon person doesn’t become too much of a caretaker for the shadow self of the
    descendant. They can certainly be a nurturing figure but they must ultimately
    let the ascendant person discover and work through their darker, shadow-self emotions
    on their own.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the moon square ascendant synastry aspect, the moon person simply *cannot*
    understand why the ascendant person dons their mask. They simply can’t grasp the
    emotions/triggers/reasons that push the ascendant person to become this public
    persona.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The moon person might also have trouble understanding what the ascendant person
    wants in a partner since this aspect is also moon square descendant synastry.
    The ascendant person’s ideal partner image just doesn’t make sense to the moon
    person on a deep, emotional level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The moon square ascendant synastry aspect can be difficult because the ascendant
    person might feel misunderstood or judged for how they act, especially how they
    act when they’re feeling insecure/in groups. And the moon person definitely doesn’t
    provide a soft place for the ascendant person to land as they’re working through
    their shadow side.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important that the moon person makes more of an effort to be gentle and
    soft, especially with their partner’s shadow side and deeper emotions. They must
    learn that they don’t have to *understand* these deep emotional hurts to be kind
    and soft. For this moon square ascendant synastry relationship to work, the moon
    person *must* learn to be sensitive, even when this doesn’t feel natural. Otherwise,
    the ascendant individual will feel perpetually unsafe in the relationship.
  prefs: []

    themselves, their mask, triggers something uncomfortable in the moon person. It
    brings up emotions that the moon person might struggle to deal with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you are the ascendant individual, try to understand that your public persona
    will rub your partner wrong. This isn’t personal – your outward personality and
    actions are just triggering something about the moon person’s insecurities in *themself*.
    It’s uncovering those feelings from childhood that the moon person would rather
    not look at.

    relationship, though it’s still difficult because they both experience hard emotions
    and don’t necessarily understand each other’s vulnerabilities. Worse, they might
    judge each other for those vulnerabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it is only by clear communication about their *own* insecurities that this
    relationship can work. Both people must try to step outside themselves and understand
    the other’s feelings, even if those emotions are not ones they have experienced
    themselves.
