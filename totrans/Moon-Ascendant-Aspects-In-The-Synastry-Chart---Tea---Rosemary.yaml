    for the moon individual. The ascendant person will naturally trigger a lot of
    deeply held emotions in the moon person.

  zh: 月亮和升星座的合相关系肯定是情感上的，尤其是对于月亮个体而言。升星座个体自然会触发月亮个体许多内心深处的情感。
- en: However, the ascendant person won’t even realize that they’re doing this – they
    are simply being themselves. It’s just their way of presenting themselves that
    will trigger the moon person and cause them to *react*. Most likely, this is because
    the ascendant person specifically triggers the moon person’s deeply held childhood
    insecurities.

  zh: 然而，升星座个体甚至不会意识到他们在做这些 - 他们只是做自己。这能触发月亮个体并导致他们*反应*。很可能，这是因为升星座个体特别触发了月亮个体根深蒂固的童年不安全感。
- en: Something about the ascendant person’s mask reminds the moon person of how they
    feel inside. The moon might *feel* the way the ascendant person *acts* but they
    don’t show it.

    synastry aspect promotes emotional comfort in a relationship. Instead, this aspect
    usually triggers the moon.

  zh: 与其他占星学家不同，我个人认为月亮和升星座的合相并不会在关系中带来情感上的舒适感。相反，这一影响通常会触发月亮个体。
- en: However, there can be some pros to this moon conjunct ascendant synastry relationship.
    The moon completely understands *why* the ascendant wears that mask because they
    understand the emotions behind it. So when the ascendant person puts on their
    mask, when they feel uncomfortable, the moon person may be the only who truly
    understands.

  zh: 然而，这种月亮和升星座的合相关系也有一些优点。月亮完全理解*为什么*升星座要戴上那个面具，因为他们理解背后的情感。所以，当升星座个体戴上他们的面具时，当他们感到不舒服时，月亮个体可能是唯一真正理解的人。
- en: If the moon individual is able to work through the triggers that are presented
    by the ascendant, then they can be uniquely suited to understand that ascendant’s
    inner emotions. However, if the moon person is consistently being triggered by
    their own emotional landscape (usually if they haven’t dealt with their childhood
    hurts), then they will not be able to see beyond their own pain.

  zh: 如果月亮个体能够处理升星座呈现的触发器，那么他们将独特地适合理解升星座内在的情感。然而，如果月亮个体一直受到自己情感中的触发（通常是因为他们没有处理好童年的伤痛），那么他们将无法看到自己痛苦之外的东西。

    ascendant person acts in conversation. If the ascendant person is quite outgoing,
    then this will feel less impactful. However, if the ascendant person has a “quieter”
    mask, then this easy flow between the two people will feel much more important.

    ascendant person presents themselves in a certain way and can figure out what
    emotions are hiding under that mask.

    willing to dive in and truly understand the ascendant person, they can become
    a source of emotional support. This is especially helpful in large groups when
    the ascendant person feels the need to don their mask.

    The moon represents the shadow side of the ascendant person, meaning that the
    moon person intuitively understands the deeper, darker, hidden emotions of the
    ascendant person, the feelings that others don’t see. For that reason, this relationship
    can feel a bit like a soul connection, as though these two have known each other
    before.

    that the moon is able to see these deep emotions. Once they have integrated their

- en: This can go a few ways. If the ascendant person is evolved, then they will probably
    appreciate this about the moon. Once they have integrated their shadow side they
    will have a lot to discuss with the moon and will feel supported in showing this
    new side of themselves because the moon person just gets it. They will be able
    to slowly reveal their deepest emotions to the moon and feel understood and supported.

    and is actively running from those deeper emotions, then they might be annoyed
    or triggered every time they glimpse their shadow through the moon. They will
    either snap in anger or run (fight or flight).

- en: Typically, the moon opposition ascendant synastry aspect indicates that the
    ascendant person sees the moon as the ideal partner in some ways, or at least
    the *archetype* of their own personal ideal partner. This is because the descendant
    represents the ideal parter as well as the shadow self. The longevity of this
    relationship will depend on how comfortable the ascendant person is with their
    own shadow side that is reflected in the moon.

    moon person doesn’t become too much of a caretaker for the shadow self of the
    descendant. They can certainly be a nurturing figure but they must ultimately
    let the ascendant person discover and work through their darker, shadow-self emotions
    on their own.

    The ascendant person’s ideal partner image just doesn’t make sense to the moon

- en: The moon square ascendant synastry aspect can be difficult because the ascendant
    person might feel misunderstood or judged for how they act, especially how they
    act when they’re feeling insecure/in groups. And the moon person definitely doesn’t
    provide a soft place for the ascendant person to land as they’re working through
    their shadow side.

- en: It’s important that the moon person makes more of an effort to be gentle and
    soft, especially with their partner’s shadow side and deeper emotions. They must
    learn that they don’t have to *understand* these deep emotional hurts to be kind
    and soft. For this moon square ascendant synastry relationship to work, the moon
    person *must* learn to be sensitive, even when this doesn’t feel natural. Otherwise,
    the ascendant individual will feel perpetually unsafe in the relationship.
