It works!

like...you can wish for anything?!

I doubt it actually works

From my knowledge, this doesn't really seem to work. There should be a limit to the potency of the spell and I think it probably scales on the strength of the caster. Drawing hearts and 8 doesn't seem effective and looks filmsy to me.

This sounds like a plausible wish spell. Be aware of a few things regarding wish spells however. The larger the wish, the longer the wait. Wishes still need to be realistic. Wish spells are like any other spell, only you are making it specific to your situation. You could cast a money spell, or you could wish for a thousand dollars. Both work the same. Only with wish spells, the spell is usually more simplistic than other spells. Wish spells are more on par with manifestation. Focus on your desire, tell the universe you want the thing, then release the energy. Reading over this spell, 8 could be considered infinity, the heart could be your hearts desire, even gold works in wish spells, its just the red I question. Unless you are wishing for love or passion, it does not seem to align with the spell. Lastly, the chant, ignore the ''say six times'' chant until you feel the energy is at its peak. This could be six, it could be sixty. Whenever you feel the energy ready to burst, that is enough times. No harm in trying it, just be sure to charge everything with energy and focus on your wish as you cast this.
