- en: Truth be an elusive spirit that chooses to whenever possible to remain hidden.
    Truth will not come readily when called nor remain long. The following incantation
    can be used to summon up Truth on a single subject but is only effective when
    Truth is summoned in honesty and good will. Truth cannot be tricked or cheated
    and will not heed the frivolous call.

- en: A single candle of beeswax should be lighted and placed on a table away from
    the draft and chill. Two pieces of natural paper need be torn to the length of
    three finger's breadth and the width of two finger's breadth. On each need be
    written the choices from which Truth shall choose. A bowl of clean water should
    be placed on the table at thy front and a circle drawn round the bowl. Once the
    circle be drawn, no more should thy hand pass in.

    "In the name of Vuall, I summon thee Truth that thee may choose of these and show
    that pure. By the virtue of the highest of thee, I command thee come forth lest
    thee suffer the pain of disobedience."'

- en: Fold each piece of paper singly and cast them together into the water, not allowing
    thy hand cross into the circle. That piece which doth unfold first be the answer
    of Truth and that which unfolds last be the lie. When Truth hath made its choice,
    dismiss the spirit, extinguish the candle and dispose of the water on freshly
    turned soil.
