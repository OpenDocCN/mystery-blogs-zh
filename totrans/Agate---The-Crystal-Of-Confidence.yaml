    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [beryl ‘the crystal of communication’.](https://wiccanow.com/beryl/)

    agate colours include black, blue, brown, grey, green, orange, pink, purple, red,
    white, and yellow. Most agates have multiple colours that are structured into

    to make beads and ceremonial axe heads. Ancient Egyptians fashioned agate into
    amulets and the Minoans of Crete and Mycenaeans of mainland Greece used these
    stones for jewellery, as did the Romans, who were especially fond of agate for
    signet rings. Throughout the middle ages, the crystal was highly valued as a good
    luck charm.

- en: Step 1 – Choose a crystal for the ritual. You can intuitively select a crystal
    by passing your hand over your collection and seeing which crystal you feel drawn
    to or you can choose a crystal that correspondences to your issue or question
    from a list of [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/).

    and [charged crystal](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-charge-your-crystals-15-fantastic-tips/)
    in your open cupped hands. Name whatever it is you want to lose, for example,
    a fear, pain, symptoms of a chronic condition or a migraine. As you hold the stone,
    imagine it getting heavier and heavier as it becomes filled with the pain, fear
    or condition you wish to lose.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Step 3 – When the stone begins to feel too heavy to hold, wash it under running
    water and visualise your negative feelings or pain being rinsed away. If the stone
    is too delicate to wash with water, pass an incense stick over it and imagine
    the smoke dispersing your negative emotions or pain.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Step 4 – Keep the crystal in a place where a light will shine on it. Repeat
    the ritual as many times as needed. You may need to repeat many times if the condition
    is ongoing. Stay patient and always use the same crystal.
