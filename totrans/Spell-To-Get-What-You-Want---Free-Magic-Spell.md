First, concentrate on what your trying to get, or want. Just for example, you want your parents to take you somewhere. Before you ask, imagine them saying yes to you, and only focus on the POSITIVE things. And when you ask, concentrate real hard on what you want them to say. Really, really hard! You should get the answer you want.

So, this can be used for anything and everything. It doesn't work all the time. So if you don't get it on your first try, don't worry. It may take practice. For a tip, use it on easier things first; think of it like levels on a game. You'll get experienced at it.
