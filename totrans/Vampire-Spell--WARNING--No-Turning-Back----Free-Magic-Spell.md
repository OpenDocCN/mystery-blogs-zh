# Vampire Spell (WARNING: No Turning Back)

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This is a classic Vampire spell with a twist to ensure that it works. Warning, it may be VERY hard to reverse.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Full Moon (Optional, but works best with)

*   Voice

*   Confidence

*   Nighttime (Optional, but works best)

## Casting Instructions for 'Vampire Spell (WARNING: No Turning Back)'

This is the well-known incantation:
''Red blood, pale skin, moonlight draw me in. Quench my blood-thirsty veins, let my body feel no pain!''

If you do this during the day, it will have a 15% chance of working, and if it DOES, you'll be more sensitive to pure sunlight than you would have been if you did it at night. You won't burn to death like in movies, you'll just get a terrible sunburn REALLY fast. And some people have said that they thought they were smoking, but who knows! If you do this spell at night, it'll have a 94% chance of working. If you do it at night with a full moon, 99%. Like it says in title, of this spell works, it's VERY HARD to go back.

Go into a fairly-sized room. Open the biggest center window, and shut off all the lights. Close the door, and stand in the middle of the room. If its Full Moon, let it shine you. Stand up straight. Close your eyes and meditate, filling it with blankness. Do this for exactly a minute. KEEP YOUR MIND BLANK. I KNOW IT'S HARD :0). Then, say the incantation clearly 10 times. Then meditate for 10 more seconds, and say quietly but clearly ''It is done.''.

Good Side Effects:
Speed (The more you use it, the faster it'll show)
Strength (The more you use it, the faster it'll show)
Vampiric Beauty (A Beauty Unique to vampires)
Hair Changes (Your hair will either get lighter or darker. Lighter is commoner for blondes, dirty blondes. Darker for brunette and black haired people. Redheads vary. Well, they all do but still. Hair will tend to kinda grow faster)
Claws? Nope. Forget it!!!!!! Your a vampire not a werewolf.
fangs (They will get sharper not longer)

Bad Side Effects
Feeling Mood Swings (Especially with love. Love is very dangerous and can be possessive of a vampire)
Occasionally, food will taste bland.
Pale Skin. This isn't bad but some people don't like it.
?Minor Garlic Allergy? (I don't know....haven't tried it but my friend said this was true but I don't know if I believe it)

Notes
Forget the whole ''Holy Water, Silver and stuff are deadly'' thing. That's just nonsense made my greedy movie people. But like I said I don't know about Garlic but I don't think it's fatal BECAUSE I LOVE GARLIC BREAD AND I DID THIS SPELL.
Food will taste bland occasionally because of your blood thing. Whatever you do DON'T TASTE BLOOD AFTER USING THIS SPELL. It'll make ALL food taste bland and you'll yearn for........................
I don't think you can turn back after using this.

Message me other side effects after you do the spell!

DemigodGirl, you said that you did this spell on yourself and your friend did it. Does it really work? Also, if you ''Don't'' drink nor taste blood, then you don't want it? Just curious...

The owner of this spell hasn't been on-line since 105\. This spell, like any other that claims to shape-shift, does not work. Please do be careful with drinking blood. There's many diseases that can be transmitted through it, also it can be toxic to your own body.

DemigodGirl has not been on this site in almost 4 years.

looks like the garlic gottem

Does this spell affect your sleeping cycle? (because vampires don't need sleep)

Only if you have a coffin, otherwise vampires simply can not sleep.

This spell will not work at all. You are human and cannot become a vampire they do not exist

Sorry, should of pointed out I was being sarcastic.

what if it donest work

Then it doesn't work. That being said, we can't become a different species with magick, so you can't become a vampire. This is a fake spell that has been floating around the internet for over a decade, you can't change your genetics or physical form with magick, and you also can't become a different species.
