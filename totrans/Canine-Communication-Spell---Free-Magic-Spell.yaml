    work if the dog is unconscious (asleep)?

- en: The spell doesn't work. You can't communicate with animals via language. Try
    observing the animal and learning how it ''speaks'' to you by its natural movement.
    My cat can't speak but I can tell most of the time what he wants by his actions.

- en: Lol, God of grass. This spell doesn't work because you can't talk with the animals.
    Try being more observant with your pet, you might be able to figure out what they
    want.

    my dogs social cues very well but its not really the same on his end and i know
    he cant really speak a language just understand sounds and cues and stuff so i
    just want a spell that can help amplify that so its almost as if he can understand
    me completely but really hes picking up my own social cues. idk if i can even
    find a spell like that or even make one im too inexperienced üòÖ
