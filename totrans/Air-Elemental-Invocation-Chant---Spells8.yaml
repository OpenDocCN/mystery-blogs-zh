- en: The element Air is the least dense of all, it is directly related to **thinking,
    intellectual skills and creativity**. Connecting with Air means reaching out to
    a world of ideas, imagination, reasoning, communication, language and fantasy.

- en: This element is directly related to creativity, it perfectly symbolizes the
    figure of the scientist, the genius, the idealist. Air wants to know, to experience,
    to understand. So much abstraction makes it seem to live sometimes in a parallel,
    unspecified reality, immersed in an ideal world.

- en: '**Air signs are Gemini, Libra and Aquarius**. Their deepest motivation is to
    make universal ideals a reality: good, beauty and knowledge. This can sometimes
    be unrealistic and impractical in a world full of rules and impositions, which
    can often leads to struggling and suffering.'

- en: The element of Air swirls around at all times. Our lungs fill deeply with its
    life giving force and it is an important component to healing. A gentle breeze
    or a hurricane of wind, air has the power to soothe or to raise your hair on end.
