 Lay out the gold cloth squarely on top of the lace. In the center sprinkle the witch hazel, cardamom, grains of paradise, basil, and caraway. Hold the sugar ginger in your hands and focus on your inner beauty; see it as ray of light making its way into your aura. Place the sugar ginger on top of the herbs. Add the cinnamon stick, the apple seeds, the rose quartz, and the garnet. Bring the corners of the cloth and the lace up to a bundle; wrap three times with the ribbon. Tie three knots. Put the ribbon rose stems directly over the ribbon and wrap the ribbon ends three more times, tying three more knots to secure the ribbon roses to the sachet. Trim any ragged ends. Raise energy and charge the sachet, saying: "Treasures without, Treasures within the glamour comes from my heart, Beauty without, Beauty within, Never from me to part. " It is done.

Charge with energy and imagine your desired outcome, but this sounds like a working charm. You could carry it with you but I suggest hanging it by your mirror where you typically preform your daily beauty routine such as washing face, brushing teeth, makeup and hair. That way, you are enchanting your space with your intended goal.
