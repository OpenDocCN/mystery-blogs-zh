- en: Whilst the sun is never a negative card but when it appears reversed it might
    indicate unforeseen adjustments or delays. You might not be feeling quite as confident
    as usual or perhaps you feel like you are not receiving the attention or success
    you deserve. The sun reversed also indicates overconfidence or impractical or
    unrealistic plans.

    should take your lifestyle down a notch. Consider whether overconfidence has caused

- en: Lovelies, I hope this gives you some basic understanding of the Sun. As with
    all things Tarot, your own interpretation of a card or reading can be highly personalized
    and wonderfully multifaceted. With this perspective in mind, it pays to understand
    any outside interpretations (like this one) as simply one perspective which you
    can adapt and change as you see fit.
