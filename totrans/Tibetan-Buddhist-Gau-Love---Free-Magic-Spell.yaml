- en: Dress a beeswax candle with a love-drawing type anointing oil, such as Love
    Me (for greater passion and committment) or Come to Me (to attract new love).
    Light the candle and then also light a love-drawing type incense powder, such
    as Love Me or Come to Me. (You need a pure beeswax candle for this spell rather
    than a parafin offertory candle, votive candle, or glass-encased candle because
    you will use some of the wax in making the amulet, and beeswax is easily warmed,
    softened, and moulded by hand; in addition, bees and their honey are associated
    with the sweetness of love.)

- en: Name two tiny lodestones (grit sized) in the names of each of the lovers. Feed
    them with a pinch of magnetic sand and then cover them with one pinch each of
    a love-drawing type sachet powder and a love herb. (For instance, you could use
    Love Me Powder and two dried Rose Petals or Follow Me Boy Powder and Damiana herb.)

- en: 'To all of the above items add one hair from each lover (it can be a head, armpit,
    body, or pubic hair, but pubic hair is the most powerful) plus, if you can get
    them, some bodily concerns such as semen, menstrual blood, or vaginal fluid from
    each lover. If you are trying to attract a new lover and cannot yet obtain hairs
    or more intimate items from both parties, then make a substitute: On a small piece
    of paper inscribe both lovers'' full names in a circle, in continuous form --
    that is, without lifting your pen from the paper, joining the names end-to-end.
    Draw a small heart around the names-circle, enclosing it. Written names will not
    be nearly as powerful as hair and personal concerns, of course, so the latter
    should always be used instead, if available.'

- en: To keep the lodestones, magnetic sand, sachet powder, and other small items
    together and prevent their rattling around or sifting out of the Gau, embed them
    all in softened beeswax taken from the burning candle. Tightly pack the Gau case
    with the resultant beeswaxed mass, which you can keep soft and workable by warming
    it gently over the candle flame as you mould it to fill the interior space.

- en: When the amulet is completed and sealed, smoke it in the fumes from the burning
    incense powder as you speak aloud your sincere desire or prayer in the name of
    the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the saint or deity of your choice. If your
    beloved is a woman, you can empower the spell further by reciting The Song of
    Solomon from the Bible as you smoke the Gau.

    points. Why is a Buddhist casting a spell? Why would said Buddhist spell include
    Christian beliefs?
