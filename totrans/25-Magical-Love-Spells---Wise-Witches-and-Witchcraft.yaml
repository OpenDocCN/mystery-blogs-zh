  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Magic can keep love alive and fresh, enhancing our inherent charms. We must
    be responsible, however, and not turn love spells and potions into a game. They
    are serious business and can act as an astral roadmap to guide the right person
    into your life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Several ingredients are necessary for creating reliable love magic. The first
    is faith in your magic and yourself. Without faith, magic becomes an exercise
    in futility. The second is intention. Without purpose and direction, magical energy
    disperses back to the source.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third part of the equation is detachment. Detach yourself from preconceived
    notions of Mr. or Ms. “Right.” Allow the universe to open its possibilities to
    you. Detach yourself from your physical ideal and concentrate on the emotional
    qualities you want in a mate. Love begins in the heart, not your eyes and sometimes
    what you see is not what you get.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, once you’ve completed a love spell, detach the magic itself. Without this
    release, like a tethered balloon, the energy will never fly. If you’re using love
    magic to draw a mate, you may still meet a few toads before finding that prince
    or princess. If you’re using it to improve an established relationship, use honesty
    as your tinder to get those sparks burning.

- en: Love seems to play hide-and-seek with those actively pursuing it. And the rules
    of the game constantly change according to social and personal attitudes. This
    makes the quest a challenge, but one which spellcraft can meet successfully. Just
    remember that you are responsible for any relationship that develops as a result
    of magical fostering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    break a potential or ongoing relationship. It simply provides a nudge or spark.
    The rest is up to you.

    can clear the way. Begin by bathing in carnation petals and bay leaves. This dispels
    negativity and makes you more open to receiving love. Then write your wish for
    love on a small piece of parchment, visualizing pink light saturating the paper.
    Take this outside at midnight, and concentrate on any single star, saying:'

    we are often our own worst critics. But to foster love, it has to start within.
    To help accomplish this, bless an apple, saying three times, *Fruit of wholeness,
    be filled with confidence and love.* Eat the apple and begin internalizing loving
    self-acceptance, then plant the seeds so this positive image can grow.
