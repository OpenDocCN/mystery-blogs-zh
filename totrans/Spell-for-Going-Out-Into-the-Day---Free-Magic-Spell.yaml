    items for this spell:**''''O Atum who went forth as the Great One of the waters,
    having power as the Double Lion, announce in your own words to those who are in
    the Presence that (name of deceased) comes as one who is in their midst, and give
    command on his behalf to the crew of Re in the evening. May (name of deceased)live
    after death like Re every day. Was Re born yesterday? Then will (name of deceased)
    be born. May every god be joyful when (name of deceased) lives just as they were
    joyful when Ptah lived, when he came forth from the great Mansion of the Prince
    which is in Heliopolis.'''''
