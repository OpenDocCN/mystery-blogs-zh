This isn't how magick works. One can believe in, work with, and/or worship Gaia, and while I've never heard of it I'm guessing there are people out there who works with satyrs as spiritual entities, but Percy Jackson is a fictional series and this isn't biologically possible.

I never read the Percy Jackson series but by reading the spell I know this not possible. Please dont waste your time on stuff like this.

You cant become a fictional character

You cannot physically transform.

You cannot become a satyr.
