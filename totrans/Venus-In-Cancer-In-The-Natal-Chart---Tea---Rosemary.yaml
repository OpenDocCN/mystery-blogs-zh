  prefs: []

    protecting yourself.

    attention is being returned then you can start to become resentful, although you
    probably won’t tell your partner what’s bothering you.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This part can get a little confusing, so bear with me as I explain it. Basically,
    Venus shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it
    does for someone with more feminine energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s up to you to choose with energy you identify with more. If you’re unsure,
    I recommend reading the description of each energy for Venus in Cancer below and
    choosing what resonates with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, in a woman or someone with feminine energy, Venus will show how the
    person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person is
    flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Venus in Cancer. These Leo
    qualities will show up directly in the personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a man or someone with masculine energy, Venus will show what kind of qualities
    they are *attracted to*. How this person will *act* depends on their Mars sign,
    but their Venus sign dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a
    partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we evolve and change and the gender lines blur, these distinctions become
    less absolute. For example, I find that *most* women will show a lot of the qualities
    of their Venus when they’re flirting, but a few of their Mars qualities will bleed
    through also.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to learn about both Venus and Mars. Each person has a unique
    combination of both qualities, although this combination may be swayed slightly
    depending on the person’s gender.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, a man who is ultra-comfortable with his sexuality will display many
    more of his Venus qualities, while a man who struggles with his sexuality probably
    won’t “own” these Venusian qualities, so he will instead look for them in a female
    partner.
