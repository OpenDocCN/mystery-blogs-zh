**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Squares of Fabric

*   Small stones or crystals

*   Dried herbs or flowers

*   Yarn or ribbon, cut into 36 - 42'' lengths.

1.Select the fabric, stones, herbs and yarn based upon the purpose of your Charm bag.

2.If have, blend your herbs and dried flowers together in a large bowl, or use your mortar and pestle.

3.Visualize the purpose of your Charm bag. If you like, offer an incantation as you blend them. For example, if you want to make one as a gift, you may say something like,

''These herbs I mix and happily blend
A gift to bestow upon a friend.
A blessing of love to you from me,
As I will, so it shall be.''

4.Place a stone in the center of the fabric, and then add about a half teaspoon of your herb mixture.

Now you can wear it as an amulet, or give them to people as gifts!
5.Gather up the corners of the fabric square, twist to form a pouch, and then tie shut with a length of yarn or ribbon. Knot the yarn securely, and then tie at the end so that people can wear it as an amulet.

6.Before distributing these to your family and friends, consecrate them to represent their sacred purpose  you can do this as part of a ritual, or by leaving them under the moonlight overnight. Treat them as you would any other magical tool.
