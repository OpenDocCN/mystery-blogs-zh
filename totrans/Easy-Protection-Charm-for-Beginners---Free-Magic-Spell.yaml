- en: I have found this spell quite useful as it can protect you from negative energies
    and harmful spells however it draws energy from the crystal so proper charging
    is important.

- en: The first step is to get a crystal or gem stone I use amethysts or quarts as
    they are good for protection spells.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the second step involves charging your crystal/gemstone I find it easier to
    use an outside source of energy to charge especially for those who have trouble
    manipulating energy I personally charge mine by burying it beneath a tree wrapped
    in a cloth marked with my personal sigil for drawing in energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However other methods can be used I prefer earth as it is the element I am drawn
    most to a simple way would be using moonlight to charge your crystal/gemstone.

- en: Thirdly one charged wrap your crystal in a cloth or put in a bag and mark the
    outside with a sigil of protection this sigil works best if it is a personal one
    but you can use another sigil as long as it is designed to protect you.

- en: tie the cloth/bag closed and keep it with you as a protective charm or store
    it in a room you wish to protect.
