- en: After completing the first two steps entailed in the Opening spell, raise the
    Black Mirror to thy face and call out, ''Dit Exodin ux dis Unon Fomeor, Recheé
    ezx Me!'' Now the guardian will come forth to you, and his face will appear in
    the mirror. If you have not placed the seal detailed in the Opening, he may attack
    you. Now, to bind him to you as a familiar spirit, chant this incantation twice,
    ''Dremon, Exodin ux dis Unon Fomeor, Y asr Sevan Tiu!'' Now the guardian is yours
    to command, and you may act in the first ring of the Abyss. The Guardian should
    be addressed as Dremon.
