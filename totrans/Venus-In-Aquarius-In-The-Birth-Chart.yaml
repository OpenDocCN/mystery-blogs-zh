- en: Venus is the sign of beauty, money, pleasure, attraction, and style, so Venus
    in Aquarius can feel like a bit of an anomaly. Aquarius is an eccentric yet scientific
    sign, whereas Venus is romance and poetry. How can these two fit together?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, I find that this placement is *neat yet unique*. It’s an odd combination
    that works really well. Some of my favorite artists and celebrities have this
    placement, probably because it always causes the individual to *stand out* in
    some way.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Venus in Aquarius, you *do* value money, but tend to see it as a means
    to an end. For you, the value of money is the experiences that it makes possible
    or the things you can do with it.
  prefs: []

    have money just for the sake of being rich.

    Venus in Aquarius dress extremely plain and simple, preferring function and quality
    over everything else, while other Venus in Aquarius individuals will dress flashy,
    edgy, and *different*.

    are *clean and neat*.

    Harry Styles, Kate Middleton, and Taylor Swift. While their actual styles of dress
    vary, they’re all extremely particular and are always immaculately dressed.
  prefs: []

    and appear simple in style, but there is always a feeling that something is *different*
    about the person. These folks carry a unique energy that makes them stand out.

    take pleasure in doing things differently or making an existing process better.
    You’re proud to follow a unique path.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, with Venus in Aquarius, you might enjoy “crusader mode,” especially
    when you’re fighting for a cause. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re involved
    with charities or philanthropy (although it could). You might just as easily care
    about children, animals, plants, or quite literally anything else. Often, this
    crusader mode is a natural instinct and isn’t necessarily something that involves
    your job or hobbies directly.
  prefs: []

    fickle. You want friends you can count on.

    group doesn’t matter much to you as long as the friendships are genuine and provide
    mental stimulation.

    specific ways you’re progressive, open, and radical, and people who want that
    variety are drawn to you.
  prefs: []

    those whose enjoy the chase, although this aloofness can later be difficult when
    you’re actually *in* a relationship and your partner wants more emotional intimacy.

    Many individuals with Venus in Aquarius are in committed, monogamous relationships
    (despite the stereotype), but they just handle feeling smothered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might enjoy relationships with different rules and will need to figure out
    how to communicate this to your partner. Most of the time, with Venus in Aquarius,
    you need to feel that you’re friends with your partner as well as lovers. Companionship
    and intellectual compatibility are extremely important to you.
  prefs: []

    or even prospective partner, you need a strong mental connection. You don’t like
    to feel bored and will quickly leave if a relationship turns stale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, I find that those with Venus in Aquarius feel an attraction to partners
    who don’t reciprocate. They might enjoy the detachment of the other person. This
    is by no means a rule, but it is something that tends to happen with the placement,
    especially during the early stages of a relationship.
  prefs: []

    will usually withdraw; they get claustrophobic in relationships easily. Neediness
    is this kiss of death for these folks.

    Venus shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it
    does for someone with more feminine energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s up to you to choose with energy you identify with more. If you’re unsure,
    I recommend reading the description of each energy for Venus in Aquarius (below)
    and choosing what resonates with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, in a woman (or someone with feminine energy), Venus will show how
    the person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person
    is flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Venus in Aquarius. These
    Aquarian qualities will show up directly in the personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a man (or someone with masculine energy), Venus will show what kind of qualities
    they are *attracted to*. How this person will *act* depends on their Mars sign,
    but their Venus sign dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a
    partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we evolve and change and the gender lines blur, these distinctions become
    less absolute. For example, I find that *most* women will show a lot of the qualities
    of their Venus when they’re flirting, but a few of their Mars qualities will bleed
    through also.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to learn about both Venus and Mars. Each person has a unique
    combination of both qualities, although this combination may be swayed slightly
    depending on the person’s gender.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, a man who is ultra-comfortable with his sexuality will display many
    more of his Venus qualities, while a man who struggles with his sexuality probably
    won’t “own” these Venusian qualities, so he will instead look for them in a female
    partner.

- en: The typical Venus in Aquarius man is attracted to partners who are a little
    different. Most people picture the stereotypical Aquarius hippie, but his attraction
    can lean towards people who are different in any specific area, especially depending
    on the house his Venus falls in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I personally know Venus in Aquarius men who are attracted to partners
    who parent their children differently, work in a job that’s a little divergent
    from what society expects, dress eccentrically, are into vintage music, etc. His
    ideal partner will be unique in a specific way that’s not the same for every Venus
    in Aquarius man. These differences might not even be obvious to others, but to
    him this is what sparks attraction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The regular Venus in Aquarius man tends to be relaxed and to go with the flow
    in social situations. He doesn’t like to be bored and needs a partner who is up
    for talking about intellectual topics and big ideas. Dullness and routine will
    kill any attraction immediately for the Venus in Aquarius man.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Independence is especially attractive to the Venus in Aquarius man. He wants
    his partner to have their own hobbies, talents, or dreams. He won’t be interested
    in anyone who becomes too needy or clingy; most Venus in Aquarius men do want
    to have a committed relationship with the right person, but they need it to be
    equal and intellectual, if not exciting and different. The Venus in Aquarius man
    is never totally conventional in a relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus in Aquarius man probably won’t mind if his partner is a bit erratic
    mentally. She might be messy, might start new projects constantly, or come up
    with new, exciting ideas. It probably doesn’t bother him to come home to his house
    redecorated or to a spouse who suddenly switches careers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When he’s first getting to know a new partner, coldness can actually be a turn-on
    for the Venus in Aquarius man. He doesn’t mind if his partner is a bit aloof,
    as long as they’re willing to discuss big ideas when they do spend time together.
    He can sometimes like the chase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Physically, the Venus in Aquarius man is just as different. He doesn’t typically
    go for the *most* attractive girl in the room, especially when choosing a long-term
    partner. These men are often attracted to someone considered plain by conventional
    standards because they see more than just beauty: the mind is most important to
    these folks.'

- en: The Venus in Aquarius woman is a free spirit who is strong-willed. In the areas
    where her Venus shines, she always follows her own path. For example, she might
    eat vegan, choose to school her kids differently, or work in a career that makes
    her a bit of an outcast. Sometimes, these differences are more subtle; for example,
    I know a Venus in Aquarius woman who is obsessed with collecting vintage items
    and only wears vintage clothing. Whatever this woman does, she does it without
    hesitation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus in Aquarius woman gets bored quickly and may jump from one project
    to another. Her dream man is also independent and solves his own problems easily.
    She doesn’t like to be needed too much. Sometimes, the Venus in Aquarius woman
    will put up with clinginess, but it’s a turn-off for her.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Her ideal partner is social and outgoing in groups. She also wants someone flexible
    who is up for anything, no matter how radical it may seem. Regardless of the stereotype
    of Aquarius (which is often free love), she does want someone trustworthy and
    loyal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a relationship, she can be a bit cold at times. She might not show a ton
    of affection, but that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t *feel *love; the Venus in
    Aquarius woman just has a hard time *showing* it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This woman can even be kind of cool or cold in bed. The idea of sex is usually
    more exciting than the actual act, and by the time she gets down to it, she might
    not be interested anymore. She can have a tough time letting loose in the romance
    and sex department.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though the Venus in Aquarius woman is “different” or unusual, I find that
    these women have pretty traditional relationships. They typically don’t mind being
    committed as long as they have their independence. They enjoy relationships where
    each partner has their own hobbies, talents, or work, and doesn’t need to be together
    24/7\. They simply need emotional space from time to time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus in Aquarius woman is good at being friends with the opposite sex and
    keeping it strictly platonic. These women often have a lot of guy friends (especially
    earlier on in life) who they just see as friends. There is a clear line for them
    between friendship and romance, although they need both in a relationship.

    and be themselves without apology, yet to also remember that other people have
    feelings. It’s easy for a Venus in Aquarius person to get so caught up in their
    own unique experiences that they forget to treat others nicely.
  prefs: []

    but they have a huge amount of warmth underneath, they just need to remember to
    access it and to treat others how they want to be treated.
