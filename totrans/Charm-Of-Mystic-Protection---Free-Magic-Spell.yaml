- en: git your mortar and pestle out and pout one large pinch of rosemary and whole
    cloves in the mortar. next break up the star anise up into small peaces and crush
    the star anise seeds and place all that in your mortar. next pout three drops
    of were wolf blood in the herbal mix after you thoroughly grounded the mix with
    all your dark energy in it. Next lite the black candle and pout a good bit of
    the melted wax into the herbal mix. finally stir the black wax thoroughly in the
    herbal mix and pout the mix in the small vile and find a cork of some kind to
    cap of the vile. finally pout a layer of the melted wax on top of the cork until
    it is completely covering the whole top of the vile. next lightly carve in to
    the wax the ancient alphabet that symbolizes protection and binding. Finely rap
    a black thread around the vales neck and form a loop in it so you can were it
    around your neck.

- en: See, this is a prime example of a flawed spell. Rosemary, cloves and black string;
    Fine choices for a cleansing or protection jar. Star anise, this could work if
    you are protecting your psychic ability since its primary energy is for psychic
    awareness. Werewolf blood, is not a thing. Yes, there are oils like bats blood,
    dragons blood, doves blood and flying oil which are not literal blood nor do they
    make you physically fly. However, there is no Magikal oil known as werewolves
    blood, at least as far as I am aware. This leads to my conclusion, this spell
    does not work as outlined. However, with a few minor changes, it has the potential
    to work. I would substitute werewolf blood for moon water, either omit the star
    anise or include another protection herb such as anise seeds which has more protection
    energy than star anise. Since this is to be worn, I would carve a protection symbol
    or sigil instead of spelling it out in an ancient alphabet. If you have never
    carved symbols into wax, it can be tricky. As for the *dark energy* part, I assume
    this is meant to be a type of witches bottle protection. If that is the case,
    you would need to add a few items. Witches bottles protect the witch from others
    casting on them. You will need items like thistle, burrs, broken glass, rusty
    nails, and other sharp/harmful objects. The idea is to work like a Magikal landmine
    and shoot shrapnel at your enemy should they attack you first. If this is the
    case, you need to know how to work the energy. Focus positive protective energy
    when you add the protection items, and baneful energy when adding the nails. You
    should also say a chant that explains what you are doing like ''Should anyone
    send ill to me, I send it back to them times three.''
