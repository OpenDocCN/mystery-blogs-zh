- en: Think hard of each person, saying as the Candles are lit, "This candle represents
    . As it burns, so burns his/her spirit." Write down the faults and problems that
    beset the home. Discuss them with the others.

- en: Then light the Votive Candle, visualizing the start of a new day and new turn
    for the better, e.g. visualize turning over an old brown leaf and finding it green
    and vibrant on the other side. Light the Yellow-Green Candle (for Anger, and Jealousy
    and Discord).Say, "Here burns away all negative emotions from and , leaving only
    love and happiness. It is in our house; it is all about us. There is tranquility
    in our home. Peace and love abound and are with us. For true happiness now is
    known. Understanding and love are there in abundance; discord and chaos are fled.
    For be it ever thus, that as patience and love do grow and prosper, so barren
    become the fields of doubt and distress. Happiness is the light that burns and
    darkness all away is sent. The home is peace; peace is the home."

    hold up the paper containing the problems, and burn it in the Votive Candle. Visualize
    all the problems vanishing. Move the Astral Candles closer to each other. Light
    the Black Candle (for Destruction of Negativity). Repeat the words, then meditate
    for 3-5 minutes on the problems having gone.

- en: Move the Astral Candles further closer to each other. Light the Light Blue Candle
    (for Peace and Understanding). Finally repeat the words once more, then meditate
    for another 3-5 minutes on the new peaceful condition of the home. Move the Astral
    candles even closer to each other. Hug and kiss each other and call out "Hurrah"
    or other such words expressing joy and relief and victory. Then extinguish the
    Votive Candle, and then the Astral and Day candles.

- en: 'Note: The spell is even more powerful if it is repeated on 3 consecutive days,
    with different day candles, and letting the Astral candles touch each other only
    at the third incantation on the third day. There is no need to write down the
    problems on the second or third day. However, the spell may be only performed
    once, in which case, the Astral candles should touch other at the third incantation.
    The ashes of the "problem paper" can be gleefully flushed down the toilet.'

    also cleanse the home to remove any lingering negative energy. A spring cleaning
    would also help.
