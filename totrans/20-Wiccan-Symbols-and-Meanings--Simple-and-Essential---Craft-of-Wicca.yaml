  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    grow afraid. They think it has something to do with devil worship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This couldn’t be further from the truth. The pentagram dates back to the Greeks.
    The reason we use it as the main symbol of our religion is that the five points
    represent the five elements: earth, air, fire, water, and spirit.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    rituals.

    principle.
  prefs: []

    distinctive Wiccan look.

    It is most commonly used to symbolize life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    get bogged down in one interpretation of the symbol. It has also been used to
    mean mortality, afterlife, and everlasting life.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thor’s hammer is a symbol of Norse mythology. It is also called Mjollnir. You’ll
    be able to find this symbol fleshed out in many different levels of detail. The
    one above is the simplest and easiest to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to legend, this hammer could call down lightning and always return
    to Thor after being thrown.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The symbol is classically used in landmark ceremonies like weddings and funerals.
    But it can also be used in storm magick due to the lightning associations, power
    magick due to the symbol of strength, and in seasonal rites due to the cyclic
    returning of the hammer.

    to represent love.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of a heart.

    love.

    a loving friendship.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the Goddess’s energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for strength, but I waited to put it here since it is so often used in magic surrounding
    strength.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The place I use symbols the most is in elemental magic. These are the ones I
    most often use for each of the elements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice how these basic symbols have an orientation that tells you how it relates
    to the other symbols. Water and fire are opposite elements and so the symbols
    are reversed from each other. Fire needs air to survive, and so the symbols are
    similar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These versions of the elemental symbols are sometimes called the **common alchemy
    symbols**.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

    used it in consecration rituals and in magick that requires all four elements.

    out a pen and paper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the purpose, you can enhance the power of a symbol by using items
    that relate to the symbol.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For earth symbols, you can draw with charcoal onto a stone. For luck, you can
    use a feather and green ink you made from bayberry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    learning to [make your own ink](https://craftofwicca.com/diy-wicca-make-ink-from-natural-sources/)
    to enhance the power.
