 On your altar, place everything.
Say over the salt:

> **"May wisdom abide in this salt, and may it preserve our mind and bodies from all corruption by Hockmael, and in the virtues of Ruach Hockmael! May the phantoms of Hyle depart herefrom; that it may become a heavenly salt, salt of the earth and earth of the salt, that it may feed the threshing ox and strengthen our hope in the horns of the Flying Bull. Amen."**

Say over the ash:

> **"May this ash return unto the fount of the living waters; may it become a furtile earth; may it bring forth the tree of life, which are the three names of Netzach, Hod, and Yesod in the beginning and in the end, by the Alpha and Omega, which are in the spirit of Azoth! Amen."**

Say over the water

> **"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters; the things which are above are like unto the things below, and the things below are like unto those things above, for the performance of the wonders of one thing, the Sun is its father, the Moon is its mother, the Wind hath carried it in its belly hereof. It ascendeth from earth to heaven and Descendeth from heaven to earth. I exorcise thee, creature of water, that thou mayest become unto man a mirror of the living God and His works, a fount of life and ablution of sins. Amen."**

Mix the ash, salt and water together and say:

> **"In the salt of eternal wisdom, in the waters of regeneration, and in the ash whence the new earth springeth, be all things accomplished by Elohim, Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, and Uriel through the Ages and Aeons. Amen."**

Go Front of the circle with the bowl and sprinkle outward. Do the same for all directions. Go back to the altar. And recite the prayer of the undines.

Dread King of the sea, who hast the keys of the floodgates of heaven, and dost confine the waters of the underworld in the caverns of earth; King of the Deluge and the Floods of the Springtime; Thou who dost unseal the sources of rivers and fountains; Thou who does ordain moisture, which is like the blood of earth, to become the sap of plants: Thee we adore and Thee we invoke! Speak to us, Thine inconstant and unstable creatures, in the great tumults of the sea, and we shall tremble before Thee; Speak unto us also in the murmur of limpid waters, and we shall yearn for Thy love! O Immensity into which flow all the rivers of life, to be continually reborn in Thee! O Ocean of Infinite Perfections! Height which reflects Thee in the depth,depth which exhalts Thee to the height, lead us unto the true life by Intelligence and Love! Lead us to immortality by sacrifice, that we may be found worthy one day to offer Thee water, blood and tears, for the remission of sins!?

Then, meditate on the mysteries of water. When you are ready, invoke the undines.
" O Spirits of the watery realms, Thy who brings forth life in abundance, O Undines, O Great Elemental Beings of the oceans, seas, rivers, ponds, lakes, streams, pools, fountains, and all other abysses of water, O Spirits of the blood of life, O unstable ones who constantly move, Whose grace flows upon all things, O Sustainers, O Spirits who speak in movements, flowing within the emotions of life, O Regenerating ones, who washes away all impurities, Who haste brought forth the floods of the Heavens, O Healing Suave, O Giver of the Gift of Life, Thy whose depths reflects thy heights, Thy whose sacrifice brings forth life, O Spirits of water, O Spirits of the west, we call Thee forth, Rain upon us, and come as the four rivers that flow forth from Eden, bringing unto us the seeds from the Tree of Life, come forth, come forth, we invoke Thee, come in Thy Gentle Guise, O come Magnificent ones. Amen."

You should feel the undines around you, if not, repeat the invocation. If you still don't feel anything, then perhaps you sent ready. If you do feel their presence, then invoke Nichsa by saying

> **"O King of the Divided waters, O Lord of the Four rivers of Eden, O Emperor of the four rivers of the Infernal Realms, O Regenerating King of Life, care holder of the Elixir of Immortality, Bestower of Gifts, Granter of Blessing, Lord of Beauty, O Lord of the Vengeful waters of the flood, O Great King of the Sea, come as the rain, and water our circle with the Heavenly Dew of Wisdom, Grace us with your presence, Bless us with Your Beauty, O Nichsa come forth from Thy depths and grace us with Thy conversation. Amen."**

If he comes, the converse with him. Ask him what you will. If not, then you probably aren't ready. When you are done with him, he will depart leaving you with all the undines around you to deal with. Ask the politely to leave. Usually, this doesn't do the trick. Elementals are playfull and try to mess around with you. If this is what happens, then say loudly and clearly.

Caput mortum, imperet tibi dominus per vivum et devotum serpentem!
Cherub, imperet tibi Dominus per Adam Yod-HaVah!
Aquila errans, imperet tibi Dominus per alas tauri!
Serpens, imperet tibi Dominus Tetragrammaton, per Angelum et Leonem!
Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Anael!
Fluat udor per Spiritum Elohim
Manet in terra per Adam Yod-HaVah!
Fiat firmamentum per Yod-HaVah-Sabaoth!
Fiat judicium per ignem in virtute Michael!

Angel of the blind eyes, obey, or pass away with this holy water!
Work Winged Bull, or revert to the earth, unless thou wilt that I should pierce thee with this sword!
Chained Eagle, obey my sign, or fly before this breathing!
Writhing serpent, crawl at my feet, or be tortured by the sacred fire and give way before the perfumes that I burn in it!
Water, Return to water!
Fire, burn!
Air, circulate!
Earth, revert to earth!?
By Virtue of the Pentagram, which is the Morning Star, and by the Name of the Tetragram, which is written in the centre of the Cross of Light!
Amen. Amen. Amen.

Finnaly, perform the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram.
