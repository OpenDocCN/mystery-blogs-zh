    You should start it after the full moon has completely risen. For the spell, you
    need a cup of stagnant water, a new and small glass bowl, 2 teaspoons of vinegar,
    lime juice, some ground angelica and a wooden spoon. When the moon starts waning,
    you should mix the ingredients in the bowl with a wooden spoon outside.

    to the bowl and repeat the following words. ‘I’m the man/girl, so and so (say
    the name of the other person) wants to love. We go together hand in glove and
    so I want to know the time has come for you to go and let it be done that it harm
    no one.’

    to be seen. You should pour the liquid on the front step as you repeat the same
    words as you did earlier in the spell. Repeat the same ritual for seven nights
    consecutively. The spell originates from voodoo tradition and reports reveal that
    in Hispaniola and other areas, where voodoo is respected, that it has been used
    many times.
