- en: Strangely enough, I get requests for a “spell to make someone call you” way
    more often than I do for general love spells.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think part of this is because most people want a specific *action* to happen.
    Just knowing that someone *might* love you doesn’t feel concrete enough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While these spells can be just as tricky and dangerous as love spells, they
    *are* possible. Today I’ll go over every aspect of the *most* effective spell
    to make someone call you.

- en: How Does This Spell Work?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much in the way that any other spell works, this spell to make someone call
    you will only work if your intention is strong enough *and* you use the right
    ingredients to release that energy into the Universe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'I’m not going to lie: this is a tough spell to cast. Your intention needs to
    be really strong to make it work effectively.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason that you need such powerful energy is because, most likely if someone
    *isn’t* already calling you, their intention is specifically to *not* call you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike other spells where there simply is no intention and you create one, you
    actually need to reverse someone’s intention with the spell to make someone call
    you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll need to make sure that you raise quite a bit of energy and direct it
    successfully. You will also need to control your mind during the spell to ensure
    that you cast it with just the right intention and thoughts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, a powerful emotion can make your intention stronger. If you feel
    grief, anger, etc., you can channel that emotion into the spell and raise much
    more energy than if you felt neutral.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, you will need to make sure that this emotion doesn’t influence
    your thoughts or intentions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you wouldn’t want to be thinking angry *thoughts *(although the
    emotion of anger can help you raise more energy) because this might make the person
    on the receiving end call you angrily.

- en: Can The Spell To Make Someone Call You Backfire?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Short answer: **yes.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of times when you casts a spell to make someone call you, the person who
    ends up calling won’t really *want* to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, the individual who you cast the spell on will feel like he/she *needs*
    to call you. They might even be a little angry or annoyed by this, so the phone
    call might not be super pleasant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you ever do something without knowing why you did it? That’s basically how
    this spell works. You’re creating a lot of unconscious energy that prods someone
    into picking up the phone without consciously *wanting* to call you.
  prefs: []

    [A love spell creates infatuation or the illusion of love](https://teaandrosemary.com/6-ways-a-love-spell-can-go-terribly-wrong/),
    but it doesn’t create the real thing.

    a honey jar spell instead](https://teaandrosemary.com/what-is-a-honey-jar-spell-and-how-is-it-different-from-a-sugar-jar-spell/).
    The person you cast the honey jar spell on will need to have some positive thoughts
    about you already, but it’s a much more effective spell if you want to create *true*
    positive feelings.
  prefs: []

- en: If you don’t care about any of this and just want to cast a spell to make someone
    call you, then go for it! Everyone has different motivations and I’m definitely
    not judging them as wrong or bad, I’m just giving you the facts.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some witches believe in the *rule of three*. This rule is based around the concept
    of karma and means that any spell you cast will come back on your threefold (three
    times worse than what you sent out).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, this means that any spell you cast with a good intention will come
    back on you just as much as the spells with bad intentions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some witches believe wholeheartedly in this rule, some believe in it to some
    extent, and some don’t believe in it at all.

    some spells I’ve cast, but I have been totally fine with other spells.
  prefs: []

    it feel okay to cast this spell? If it does, I personally think you’ll be fine.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a tough question to answer. A spell to make someone call you is really
    tricky and depends on *so many factors.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that if your intention is just right and you raise a huge amount of energy,
    this spell will theoretically work right away. To do this, you would need to not
    only be an incredibly strong witch, but you would also need to execute this spell
    *perfectly*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might take a bit of time for this spell to make someone call you to actually
    work. It all depends on the intention that you put out and the amount of energy
    you were able to raise.

- en: I do find that most of the time, with this spell to make someone call you, you’ll
    find that it won’t work either because your intention wasn’t strong enough, or
    because the other person’s intention was *too* strong.

    in the universe.

    You can keep trying until it works. However, I recommend that you figure out [*why*
    it didn’t work](https://teaandrosemary.com/3-easy-ways-to-know-if-a-spell-worked/)

    then feel free to change up this spell, however I really recommend using a candle
    at the minimum.
