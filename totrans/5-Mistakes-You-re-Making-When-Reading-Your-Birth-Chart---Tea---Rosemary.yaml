    chart: I was completely overwhelmed.'

    those down, you remember that there’s a secondary grid full of aspects.

- en: I made a lot of mistakes during my astrology journey and eventually figured
    out why my readings weren’t working, so I’m writing this post to help out others
    who are making similar mistakes, because it’s *really* frustrating when a reading
    just doesn’t work!

    I made all of these errors myself. And here’s the thing: I don’t really care about
    mistakes at all if the reading is accurate, but I’ve found that these 5 mistakes
    in particular cause readings to be *extremely inaccurate*, which is why I think
    they’re so important to correct.'

- en: 5\. You Only Study The Big Three
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most regular folks only know their sun sign, but when you dig a bit deeper,
    you first learn that your sun sign, moon sign, and ascendant (or rising sign)
    are the most important placements in your chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is great if you just want to dabble, but if you’re hoping to get deeper
    into astrology, then you need to realize that there is **way** more than just
    these big three signs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, my big three are mostly fire signs. Looking at that, anyone would
    say that I’m ambitious, outgoing, and aggressive. And yes, I am all of these things,
    but I also have 6 planets in Pisces, meaning I’m super sensitive, musically inclined,
    into the occult and divination, etc. I cry easily and don’t like to be around
    people for too long because I’m so energetically sensitive. If you only looked
    at my big three signs, you wouldn’t get an accurate reading on me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have only been studying your big three signs, I recommend taking the
    plunge and learning about other planets. A great way to begin is with the CoStar
    app, especially if reading full-on charts feels too daunting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CoStar app (this post isn’t sponsored, BTW, I just think this app is the
    best for beginners) tells you what sign and house each of your planets is in.
    It’s a clear layout of your chart (if you don’t know the symbols) that you can
    use to then do your own research.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re already doing this, consider taking the next step by beginning to
    work with your actual char. It’s key in astrology to eventually see the chart
    laid out before you; the natal chart helps you to put it all together instead
    of reading each placement completely separately.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2

- en: When you first begin, you might want to assign “good” or “bad” attributes to
    each planet, sign, house, or aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I remember the first time I looked at a synastry chart (which is a chart that
    shows the relationship between two people) for myself and my boyfriend at the
    time. I googled each placement and aspect, trying to determine if the relationship
    was good or bad.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I saw a lot of squares, which I didn’t like, and measured them against the trines.
    I decided that our relationship was mostly bad and felt discouraged.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The thing is, none of my assumptions were correct. Squares are difficult because
    they force change, which can be good in the long run; trines can be too easy leaving
    no attraction between the partners. We’re happily engaged now, by the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are *so* many ways that you could look at your chart in black and white.
    You might think that Saturn is bad because it means limitations or karma; the
    South Node is bad and the North Node is good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I encourage you to let go of these beliefs and to look at each placement and
    aspect as good *and* bad. Every single piece of your chart has both, and it is
    your own choices and actions that determine which qualities you express.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, with Mars in Libra, you can be extremely petty, manipulative, and
    can be a bit of a social climber, or you can peaceable and work to solve arguments
    through logic. This can be one of the most wonderful placements or the most difficult.

    to become prideful and *need* praise to survive emotionally.

    up to the individual.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your natal chart is a picture of the sky at the exact moment you were born,
    while a transit chart is a picture of the sky right now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many beginner astrologers get their hands on a transit chart and then try to
    figure out how the current patterns in the sky are impacting their own chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While transit astrology is useful, it’s very difficult. It really is an entire
    study all on its own. If you’re a beginner, this will be *super* overwhelming
    and might put you off astrology for good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my experience, it’s really difficult to figure out transit astrology if you
    don’t know regular natal astrology. I always recommend that students start with
    their own birth charts and the charts of those they know well before moving onto
    other types of astrological readings.

    that I had to include it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Repeat after me: *your Venus sign does not determine your love life.* Venus
    rules attraction and romance, so some elements of your Venus sign will be present,
    but Venus is *definitely* not all that matters.

    aspects of your love life. After all, we’re not one-dimensional.

- en: 1\. You Try To Make Clear Rules About Each Planet Or Sign
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’re almost all guilty of this one. When you first learn about astrology, the
    temptation is to try and define each planet and sign into one definition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This doesn’t work because every sign, as well as every planet, has many different
    sides to it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s take Scorpio, for example. Scorpio can be power, obsession, mysticism,
    the occult, depression, desire, passion, drive, emotion, suspicion, transformation,
    trauma, etc. I could go on and on with these keywords, but I think this clearly
    illustrates that one placement just can’t be *all *of these.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a placement in Scorpio, you might find yourself suspicious, jealous,
    and obsession. Or, you might find yourself suspicious and driven to overcome this
    jealous nature, creating transformation. This suspicion may come from trauma (another
    Scorpionic element) or it might just be a part of your personality. Then again,
    you might possess other Scorpio qualities but have no suspicion or jealousy at
    all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no one size fits all with any planet or sign. For this reason, I recommend
    studying your own chart and the charts of those you know *well* in order to figure
    out what side of each sign and planet fits the person. What qualities do you or
    they have that are from this sign?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Astrology can feel a bit like a science when you get into the technical side
    of it, but I really believe that it is, at its core, an art. There is a flow to
    reading a chart that requires an intuitive mind to decipher *how* a sign or placement
    fits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It might take you a while to figure out how each of your placements express
    themselves or how each sign shows up in your life, but I promise that it’s worth
    the effort! My point is: remember to *apply* your knowledge and work with the
    definitions to fit the situation and planet instead of reading a definition straight
    from the book or website.'
