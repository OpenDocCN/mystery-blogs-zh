You cannot become a vampire.

what about the people that do drink blood

In my older comments, I did not specify, but this spell is clearly for the type that drink blood, which are not physical beings, ergo this is fake. As for those who drink blood, they are not vampires. The human body cannot digest large quantities of blood. Blood sausage and blood pudding is one thing, a pint of blood with each meal is another. As for Girldeath, KitsRevenge, Witchslayer, or whatever new account you come up with when you inevitably get gagged, yes, there are psychic vampires, though I doubt they are proven by science. Most psi vampires are born, and those who ''become'' psi vampires do so by practicing energy manipulation, not a spell. On an unrelated note, why did you pick the username ''Uglyfreak'' exactly? Negative self talk can poison mentally and spiritually. I am sure you dislike me quite ferociously, otherwise I fail to see why you keep harassing me, but I hope you do not think so negatively of yourself. Even if it is simply a username, words have power, and I do not want you to bring yourself down as a result.

@alphanumerc5, The people that do drink blood have a mental condition (I think). And they aren't vampires. They do not have fangs. They do not drink from necks or directly from any living creature.

And they only drink teaspoons. Far below the usual whole cup or two.

I believe that you can do anything you set your mind to, the only barrier between someone and being a ''vampire'' is their own imagination, but i do believe that in order to become a vampire, one must also understand that the mythological definition of a vampire doesn't exist, and one cannot just become one of them, the term ''vampire'' was first used in the 1700s, and was created because back then and even now (but rarely) there was a skin condition known as PCT that cause painful blisters and lesions on the skin due to exposure to sunlight, and it was believed back then that drinking small quantities of blood could stop the pain for a short period of time, this led to those people being called vampires, which then became a myth of the undead, i am a member of a vampire cult, i have Heliophobia, not to mention i am well educated on a series of subjects, and even i will tell you that they modern day interpretation of a ''vampire'' cannot exist on the mortal plane

Vampirism (and other 'revenant' adjacent beings) also came from a lack of understanding of bodily decomposition. For example bodies going from rigor to being soft and flexible, red blood at the mouth/lips, lengthened fingernails and hair that was mistaken for growth when it was actually from skin shrinkage, decompositional gasses filling the belly and making it swell/fill. That sort of thing.
