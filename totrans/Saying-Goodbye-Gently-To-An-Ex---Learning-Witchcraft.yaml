    conclude your relationship without unnecessarily hurting any feelings.

- en: Put the name of your significant other, the one that you want to break up with,
    on the paper. Once the ink will not smear any more, light the candle. Put the
    paper in the flame, allowing it to blacken and curl. As it crinkles, hold the
    paper where you can see it. Visualize the person moving away from you. Make sure
    you picture the separation. Once the paper becomes too difficult to hold, put
    it in the dish. As you watch the smoke, think about the person continuing on their
    life journey without you.
