What does this mean accordance with inputs 47 and 36,

It doesn't matter. It's fake.

You can not grow physical wings, humans do not have wings naturally, Magic works with nature, not against it, so any spell claiming you can do something unnatural like grow wings is fake and will never work.

what about 45? 45 is the crystal manifestador
