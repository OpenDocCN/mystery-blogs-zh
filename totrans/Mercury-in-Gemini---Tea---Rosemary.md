Mercury is the planet that rules the mind, thought processes, and communication style in Astrology.  It tells us not what we think about, but how we think. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, and moves the fastest. It may be difficult to differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is the persona, and Mercury is the mind. 

## Mercury in Gemini: Mercury and the Mind

People with Mercury in Gemini are constantly thinking. Their mind thrives off of external stimulation, and they can get bored very easily when their surroundings are not exciting enough. 

Mercury in Gemini people crave stimulation, but they can also become very easily overwhelmed. This is a very difficult balancing act for them. They can become easily bored, but also very easily overstimulated.

The Mercury in Gemini mind is constantly looking for something new and *exciting*. When there is nothing exciting going on, Mercury in Gemini people will create something exciting. This makes them fairly dramatic individuals, always trying to stir something up to keep themselves stimulated. 

These are the people who create drama just to become overstimulated by it, stressed out by it, and then later regret having created it. Mercury in Gemini is very smart and usually knows how to get themselves out of these kinds of situations. 

Mercury in Gemini comes across as being very impulsive. However, this is not the case. Unlike other Mercury signs like Mercury in Capricorn, this Mercurial mind works very fast. They do not make impulsive decisions; instead, they just take much less time to think things through. 

People with Mercury in Gemini are always learning something new. They often get in research rabbit holes, and want to learn a bit about every subject. Mercury in Gemini people can get bored after too long researching one subject, and they move on to the next. 

They have information about lots of different things, but they never *fully master* anything. They would have a large array of information that they can pull out at different times. This makes them a chameleon in crowds, because they can always talk about *anything*. 

### Dissociative

The Mercury in Gemini mind is incredibly dissociative compared to other minds. These people rarely use their intuition when making decisions, and often struggle when trying to mentally process their emotions. Their emotional body and mental body are incredibly disconnected, and they struggle blending the two. 

When things happen that upset them, they may end up dissociating from reality because they do not know how to handle it. Mercury in Gemini may logically come up with a solution, but this solution usually does not involve feeling and working through the emotions that caused the dissociation. 

People around Mercury in Gemini may feel like they have two different sides. One is their upbeat, stimulated, happy side, and the other is their dissociated side. Mercury in Gemini people may not even realize that it is their emotional body that is causing them to dissociate, but they do know that they need time to recharge. 

One of the best things a Mercury in Gemini person can do is *feel their emotions.* Even if they cannot mentally process them, focusing on where the physical pain actually exists in the heart chakra will help them not to dissociate so often. This will allow them to give attention to their emotional body without trying to connect their mental and emotional bodies, which are naturally disconnected with this placement. Only after the emotions are felt can Mercury in Gemini’s logical solutions begin to work. 

Feeling your emotions is actually simple. Think about the thing that is hurting you/upsetting you in your head, and then focus on the feeling it creates in your chest. It may be a tightness, or a sharp pain. Shift your attention to that point of pain, and just allow your body to feel it completely until it dissipates on its own. 

## Mercury in Gemini: The Master Communicator

If Mercury in Gemini is positively afflicted or conjunct Sun, these people come across as very outgoing and social. They are naturally communicative, and have the unique ability to chameleonize and fit in with any group. People are naturally drawn to their charisma and upbeat energy. Like Mercury in Libra, these people are natural mirrors and mirror back to us the things we like most about ourselves. 

Mercury is very strong in its home of Gemini, making Mercury in Gemini people a little intimidating to others. When they are being fun, social, and outgoing, people feel incredibly lucky to be in their good graces. Mercury in Gemini makes people feel important just by talking to them and engaging with them. It may not be something they actually *do, *but just an energy that they give to people. 

On the other hand, people who are very close to someone with Mercury in Gemini in their chart may feel like they have to walk on eggshells a lot. When Mercury in Gemini people are dissociating, or are feeling overstimulated, they can be very nasty with their words. They pick up on everything from their surroundings, and know exactly the thing to say to hurt you. 

The positive side of this is that they rarely ever mean it. Mercury in Gemini uses words to connect with people, but also to disconnect from people when they need to. Unlike Mercury in Capricorn people who rarely give an opinion but when they do, it is meaningful, Mercury in Gemini is much more flighty with their words. 

The things Mercury in Gemini people say may hurt in the moment, but they don’t stick to you the same way that other signs do. There is less energy behind the words, and most people can see that they are just a defense mechanism and protection for the Mercury in Gemini person when they cannot deal with their emotions, or even feel them. 

### Social Butterfly

One of the most positive aspects of Mercury in Gemini is their adaptability. They are social butterflies in all kinds of situations, and can make anyone like them. Mercury in Gemini know how to turn on the charm when they want to. They are not so overtly charming like Mercury in Libra, instead they are more intellectually charming. 

Mercury in Gemini minds work so fast that they pick up on what is important to the people they are talking to, and reflect it back to them. This makes them incredibly malleable and likable. In addition to their ability to reflect their strengths, Mercury in Gemini’s knack for being a jack of all trades (master of none) makes them able to participate in almost any conversation. 

Mercury in Gemini people know exactly what story to tell when, and when the audience is captivated. This makes them very good in groups of people, and people tend to naturally gravitate towards them. 

These people should be careful not to make enemies and become too cliquey. Because they do usually have the upper hand in social situations, Mercury in Gemini can easily make people feel like outsiders if they want.

## Mercury in Gemini Woman

The Mercury in Gemini Woman has a lot of air energy to her thoughts. She is intellectual and social, and often may be seen as a prize to be won. Men put her on a very high pedestal, since these women’s minds tend to be very attractive. 

The Mercury in Gemini Woman is very charming and attractive. She uses words to get people on her side, and may have a very large net of people who hold her in high esteem. She is strong in her convictions, but changes her mind often depending on any new research she does. Her thought processes appear to almost blow with the wind.

She is social and outgoing, and always wants to be doing something different and fun. If the Mercury in Gemini woman feels like she is in too much of a rut, she will try to do something to break out of it. This may be going new places, or seeing new people. Her mind thrives off of new experiences, so it may be difficult to get this Mercury in Gemini woman to commit. 

## Mercury in Gemini Man

The Mercury in Gemini man is equally as much of a catch as his female counterpart. People wanting to approach this man may feel nervous or even reluctant, as his mental energy is very strong. People hold the Mercury in Gemini Man in high esteem, and listen to his opinions (no matter how rapidly changing they may be). 

The Mercury in Gemini man is very social and likes to interact with others. When they are under-stimulated, they may become passive aggressive or angry. They require a lot of stimulation in life, but not too much. 

Idle hands are the devils work and may make the Mercury in Gemini Man act out. He is more dramatic than his female counterpart, seeking out drama and danger rather than just attempting to expand his horizons. This is the kind of man who will start a fight just for the sake of fighting. 

It is very important that the Mercury in Gemini man get the rest he requires after a long day. When he becomes overstimulated, the same thing may happen as when he is under-stimulated– he may act out. The only cure for this is a good nights sleep and some time to rest and relax.
