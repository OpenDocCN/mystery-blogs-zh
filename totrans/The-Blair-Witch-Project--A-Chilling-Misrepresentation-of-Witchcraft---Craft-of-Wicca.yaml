- en: '*The Blair Witch Project* is one of the most popular witch-themed movies of
    all time. But the thing is, it’s not really a movie about witches. It’s about
    three student filmmakers who get lost in the woods and start seeing things that
    aren’t really there.'

    and they use their powers to hurt people. This is a really harmful stereotype
    that only serves to further the misconception that witches are evil and dangerous.

    powers to help yourself and others, and it’s a practice that can be incredibly
    healing.

    portrayal of witchcraft. There are plenty of other movies out there that do a
    better job of that.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You went to see The Blair Witch Project, expecting an accurate portrayal of
    witchcraft, and instead, you got a bunch of theatrics and some shaky camera work.
    Unfortunately, the film got a lot of things wrong about witchcraft.
  prefs: []

    dark rituals. We are simply people who have chosen to embrace magic and use it
    for the benefit of all.

    the movie). We are just like everyone else, except we have access to a world that
    most people don’t understand.

    connection. We use our magic to help others and make the world a better place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a fictional story and is not based on real events or actual witchcraft
    practices. As a result, it is not accurate to say that the film got anything “right”
    about witches, as it is not intended to be a factual portrayal of witches or witchcraft.

    up until the 18th century, witchcraft was considered a capital offense. So to
    see witches represented in such a negative light in *The Blair Witch Project*
    is really disheartening.
