    a large impact on your entire life. Here are the main ways that Venus in Libra
    shows up.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Venus in Libra means that you probably don’t focus on money a lot. If you do,
    this will be because of other placements n your chart. Venus in Libra cares more
    about balance than about accumulating wealth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, someone with Venus in Libra and Mars in Leo might care about money
    quite a bit, but this is because of their Mars sign rather than Venus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whether you dress fashionably or not, something about the way you appear feels
    put-together and non-threatening. You have your own unique sense of style that
    you never have to question.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the area of the house that Venus in Libra is in, you’re elegant and graceful.
    You may even be charming. You know how to do things well without going overboard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anything tacky or overdone will be abhorrent to you. Grace is important in all
    things. You’re good at putting people at ease and your style probably reflects
    this.

    and stimulating conversations make you happy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also enjoy art, music, poetry, writing, or culture. You have a keen
    mind and want to use it in some way. This can vary from person to person with
    Venus in Libra, but you usually need *some* interesting outlet or way to express
    yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, one person with Venus in Libra might be into punk rock and participate
    in a band. Yet another may love learning, especially philosophy, and focus on
    a lot of reading and writing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    In general, you don’t like discord.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the house that your Venus in Libra is in. It can make you happy to please others,
    especially the people you care about most.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You value being around other people. As a Venus in Libra person, you probably
    care a lot about your partnerships and relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of this, you may go to great lengths to avoid fights. Peace is *extremely*
    important to you and is one of your core values. You’re good at balancing things
    in a group; you’re the person to notice when one member is unhappy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also care about fairness in all things, especially friendships and romance.
    Sometimes, this can be a bit at odds with your need for peace. Depending on the
    situation, you will either acquiesce to avoid fighting, or you will stand up for
    your beliefs to get justice.
  prefs: []

    and put-together in appearance. You’re also pretty witty and mentally sharp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have an interesting mind, but you know how to use your wit in a social way.
    Unlike other intellectual astrology signs, you aren’t removed from society. People
    are attracted to your keen sense of intellect. Your intellect is quite charming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you want to impress someone else, you will try to turn on the charm. You
    use a mix of kindness and intellect that’s very subtle. No one with Venus in Libra
    will want to be the loudest person in the room; you just want to be the most poised
    and interesting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, you may be a bit disingenuous when you’re flirting because you want
    to be liked. This can even happen in your platonic relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Venus in Libra, you’re good at “mirroring” other people and showing them
    what they want to see. You can easily conform to many situations, but this drains
    you because you must hide your true self. It also makes it difficult for other
    people to really get to know you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re attracted to people who are aesthetically agreeable and *nice.* You don’t
    like anyone too aggressive, abrasive, or extreme. Anything *pleasing* is exactly
    what you want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Romance, such as candles or flowers, may be important to you, but you also value
    good conversation and shared activities. You need a mental connection to really
    be *into* someone.
  prefs: []

    you don’t like to be alone.

- en: When you’re in a relationship as a Venus in Libra, you simply want fairness.
    You will treat the other person how you want to be treated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, you can go overboard with your emphasis on fairness. Be careful that
    you don’t keep score. Try to let reciprocation come a bit more naturally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might get upset if you feel that you put a *lot* of effort into pleasing
    your partner and don’t get an equal amount of effort returned. Big blowouts aren’t
    your style (although this is influenced by your Mars) so you quietly build up
    resentment. Sometimes, this comes out sideways in a passive-aggressive manner
    to “settle the score.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Venus in Libra means that you *really* want your relationships to work. You
    may have a fear of being alone, so you might gloss over the bad issues. You turn
    yourself into a martyr, but then feel turned off and emotionally distanced from
    your partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because you aim to please in general, you might attract bullies. This can be
    in a romantic manner or platonically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Venus in Libra, you have a very polished manner in love. You avoid aggression
    and overly-emotional displays. This can sometimes make your partners feel like
    you’re not invested, but you show your commitment through actions. It’s easy for
    you to go overboard trying to please your partner in many small ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to communication, you *always* want tact. Anything too uncouth
    or abrasive will turn you off. The best style of communication for you is fair
    and balanced without talks too much emotion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sexually, you also enjoy the *finer* things. You might like the whole act to
    be beautiful rather than aggressive or primal. In fact, you probably don’t enjoy
    anything super messy, although this will depend a lot on your Mars placement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intellectual simulation is what gets you going initially. You simply must have
    a good mental bond with your partner in order to feel sexual. A little romance
    never hurts, too!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally with Venus in Libra, you treat your partners how you want to be treated.
    If you get this reciprocation back, then you’re happy as a clam. Problems only
    arise when you feel that you’re being treated unfairly but don’t stick up for
    yourself.

- en: This part can get a little confusing, so bear with me as I explain it. Basically,
    Venus shows itself differently for someone with more masculine energy than it
    does for someone with more feminine energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s up to you to choose with energy you identify with more. If you’re unsure,
    I recommend reading the description of each energy for Venus in Libra (below)
    and choosing what resonates with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, in a woman (or someone with feminine energy), Venus will show how
    the person acts and what vibes they gives off towards others. When this person
    is flirting, they will assume many of the qualities of Venus in Libra. These Libran
    qualities will show up directly in the personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a man (or someone with masculine energy), Venus will show what kind of qualities
    they are *attracted to*. How this person will *act* depends on their Mars sign,
    but their Venus sign dictates what types of energy they are drawn towards in a
    partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we evolve and change and the gender lines blur, these distinctions become
    less absolute. For example, I find that *most* women will show a lot of the qualities
    of their Venus when they’re flirting, but a few of their Mars qualities will bleed
    through also.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to learn about both Venus and Mars. Each person has a unique
    combination of both qualities, although this combination may be swayed slightly
    depending on the person’s gender.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, a man who is ultra-comfortable with his sexuality will display many
    more of his Venus qualities, while a man who struggles with his sexuality probably
    won’t “own” these Venusian qualities, so he will instead look for them in a female
    partner.

    not always feel that he’s the most important person in the room, but he has a
    witty, intellectual appeal that is quiet yet strong.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He is attracted to beauty, grace, and to his “ideal woman.” Sometimes, this
    man might create an image of his ideal woman in his mind. He will be disappointed
    when he finds that she doesn’t actually exist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, when this man meets someone he may “beef up” her qualities in
    his mind. Again, he will be let down when he figures out that the woman in reality
    is much different than the picture in his head.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He might also get into relationships that are shallow, or he may attract superficial
    women. He could create an intellectual personality for his partner in his head
    because he likes the *physical* look of the woman in front of him.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    couple. This doesn’t always work out for him, but it can be a motivation for entering
    into a relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus in Libra man won’t be attracted to the most brash woman in the room.
    Coarseness, crudeness, and loudness are big turn-offs for him.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, he will look for someone smart and balanced. Although he is definitely
    attracted to looks (like any Libra placement), he also loves understated charm
    and simple but clean beauty. He actually wants his partner to *feel* beautiful
    rather than just appear like a trophy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    When he feels off-kilter around someone, he will probably want to get away from
    them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    hard to please someone he loves, but he also wants to be treated fairly.  The
    Venus in Libra man will grow unhappy over time if he believes that he is giving
    too much. He will build up resentment towards his partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This man can have some abandonment issues and a secret desire to complete himself
    through a relationship. This probably won’t be obvious on a conscious level, but
    this is usually why he *must* be in a relationship. He will give quite a bit in
    order to keep a relationship, yet he becomes unhappy in the long run.
  prefs: []

- en: The Venus in Libra man wants his relationships to be easy and peaceful. He has
    a tendency to lie in order to keep the peace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and balance. Sometimes, the Venus in Libra man just can’t figure out how to have
    both in a partnership.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus in Libra man is really sensitive to the needs of his partner. He is
    a pleaser and can be a wonderful person to be in a relationship with. However,
    his partners need to be careful to notice if he is avoiding the truth or not speaking
    up when he needs something.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He has trouble telling the hard truths because he doesn’t want to upset anyone
    or to fight. Over time, this can cause serious problems. He will build up resentment
    towards his partner until he fights back in passive-aggressive ways or leaves
    the relationship altogether.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    creative, and interesting. He’s a true gentleman – he would never leave someone
    in trouble and has a caring heart.

    Libra woman *needs* a relationship more than any other Venus placement. She feels
    defective or even useless without a partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, she treats her partner as she would like to treated. She supports her
    partner’s individuality and notices the small things about them. The Venus in
    Libra woman just wants the same treatment in return. She wants to be noticed,
    too. It can be *extremely* hurtful for her to be ignored; she will be crushed
    if her partner doesn’t reciprocate her efforts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, the Venus in Libra woman will give her personal power away in order
    to stay in a relationship. When she gives up a vital piece of herself, she is
    left feeling powerless and empty. If something does go wrong with a partner, she
    may feel that she’ll never be whole again.

    her.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    than by actual sex. She easily detaches from the more realistic elements of lovemaking
    and focuses on the *ideal*, but she is disappointed in real life when things are
    messy or dirty.
