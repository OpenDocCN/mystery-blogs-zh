    work with Dragons similar to spirits, but you'll always be human.

- en: While I've never personally seen a night fury, they are similar in appearance
    to Chaos Dragons. I'll give a small ''maybe astral'' since astral transformation
    is possible, but I doubt this spell would work either. You don't really need a
    spell to astrally transform anyway. They might help some, but typically, you just
    think about what you want your form to appear as and it changes.
