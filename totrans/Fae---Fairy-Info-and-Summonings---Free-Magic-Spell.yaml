    instruments! They love the sounds they make, and I myself recommend them for any
    home!

    humans be advised!!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sit down by your fairy spot and think about all the lovely things in your life!
    All that you love and care about! And whenever you start thinking about bad things,
    like finances and family disputes... think about love and friendship and sweet
    things like the fae! And whenever you lose focus, don't give up hope! Know that
    there must be a light somewhere that's casting all the shadows on our existence!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, calm down. Breathe. Question your existence. Wonder how something so
    great could be formed in this time and this place, and feel your aura glowing
    around you. Your light should be enough to guide the fae to your home!

- en: Some rather helpful suggestions here. A couple things, if you bake a fairy cake
    as an offering, offer the perfect cake, even if you use a toothpick to check if
    it is done that mark can offend some fairys and they will give you misfortune.
    Fairys are not sweet joyous beings of pure love and light as today's culture claim,
    many can be spiteful, tricksters, ugly, and cruel. Be respectful and polite, but
    be cautious so as not to upset the fairy. They are far more like Tinkerbell in
    the original tale, helpful and loving to Peter, but murderous and vengeful to
    Wendy, over today's depiction of the character; a kind friend to all.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are traditional ones, but you can use a basic cake recipe and add honey
    and lavender. You could also look for a lavender oat cake/cookie. Research herbal
    cakes and floral cakes. By floral, I mean rose, lavender, lilac, so forth. They
    also enjoy saffron, so saffron cakes too. When you bake the cakes, and I am referring
    to cupcake size, offer the best ones. It can be insulting to offer a burnt one,
    one you checked with a toothpick, or has other imperfections. You should also
    research the fairy in question as some prefer sweets while others like savory.
    Some fairy's like whisky, others wine. Some even consume meat, so research is
    key.
