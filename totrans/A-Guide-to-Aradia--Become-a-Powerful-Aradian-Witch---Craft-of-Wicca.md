Aradia is a name that is often connected with witchcraft. But who is Aradia? What does the Gospel of the Witches say about her? And how can you become an Aradian witch?

 ## Who is Aradia?

Aradia, the goddess of the witches, comes from Italian folklore. She is a powerful goddess who commands respect and is often invoked for help in times of need. Aradia is also known for her wisdom and for her ability to heal the wounded.

 Aradia is a figure that appears in the *Gospel of the Witches*, which is a text found in Italy that dates back to the fifteenth century. Aradia is believed to be the daughter of Diana, the goddess of the hunt, and her consort Lucifer. She is seen as a figure who provides guidance to witches and teaches them how to use their magic for the benefit of all.

 Aradia saw how Christianity had oppressed the lower classes in ancient times and so she came to earth and taught the peasants witchcraft to have the power to stand up to their oppressors.

 Aradia is sometimes known as the Queen of the Witches because of this. She was one of the reasons Wicca and witchcraft proliferated throughout the ancient world and survives to this day.

### How to Pronounce Aradia

The name has its origins in Italian, so if you are a native English speaker this one should not be difficult. It is pronounced with stress on the second syllable.

 The first syllable is “uh.”
The second is “ray.”
The third is “dee.”
The fourth is “uh.”

 This is probably already how you guessed it would be said: uh-RAY-dee-uh.

## What Does the Gospel of the Witches Say About Aradia?

The *Gospel of the Witches* is an ancient book that is believed to have been written by a group of women who practiced witchcraft. In the gospel, the witches are portrayed as beings who are able to commune with the spirits of the earth and the sky. They are also believed to be able to cast spells and perform other magical rituals.

 The gospel of the witches is not accepted by mainstream Christianity, but it is still studied by some scholars. Some people believe that the gospel of the witches provides a unique perspective on the practice of witchcraft. 

For instance, the Roman Catholic Church bans mention of this important text. This is because they know Aradia is a Goddess that tried to overthrow the church. They cannot admit this because it goes against their theology.

 Let’s move on to the part everyone has come here for. How to invoke Aradia.

## Invoking the Goddess Aradia

There is no one definitive way to invoke Aradia, as the goddess is a complex and multifaceted figure. However, some common practices include invoking her through prayer or meditation, reciting her sacred texts, and honoring her with offerings of candles, flowers, and incense.

It is also important to remember that Aradia is a goddess of transformation, so be open to asking for her help in manifesting your desires and goals.

 Our method will be to chant an invocation with her symbols on an altar under the moonlight.

### Symbols of the Goddess Aradia

Here are the common symbols of Aradia:

*   The Moon
*   The Star Sapphire
*   The Chalice
*   The Pentacle
*   The Trident
*   The Rose Cross

Let’s discuss the two listed symbols you might not know about: star sappphire and the rose cross.

 A ***star sapphire*** is a type of sapphire that has a star-like design on it. You can see it here:

It is a type of gemstone that is said to have magical properties. It is often used as an amulet to protect the wearer from harm and is also said to bring good luck.

 I highly recommend using a piece of star sapphire jewelry for this invocation so that you can keep the Goddess and her protection near to you at all times.

 The ***rose cross*** is a symbol that has been used by witches for centuries. The rose cross is made up of a cross of the four elements and circles or actual roses. The circles represent the duality of the universe and the goddess Aradia.

Inside the cross is a pentagram:

### The Invocation

Now that you have chosen the symbols that most resonate with you, it is time to perform the Invocation of Aradia.

 Set the symbols on your altar and choose a clear night with a full moon. Take a few breaths to clear your mind and then say in a full voice.

> I call to thee Aradia
> From full moon
> Bring your power
> To help attune
> 
> I hold this stone
> Sapphire of blue
> Gifts from above
> Invoked and true
> 
> Protect and enhance
> I worship thee
> Teach me of magick
> Wide as the sea

Sit under the moon and bring the symbol to your heart. Close your eyes and wait for a sign that the invocation has worked. This is usually a warm feeling of love overwhelming you.

 You have now invoked Aradia.
