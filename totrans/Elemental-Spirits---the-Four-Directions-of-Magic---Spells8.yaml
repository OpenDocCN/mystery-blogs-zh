    and Air**. [Wiccans](https://spells8.com/types-of-wiccan-witches/) and other Neopagans
    also work their Magic with a fifth element called **Spirit** (also known as Akasha
    or Aether). But have you ever invoked an elemental being?'

- en: Physician and alchemist Paracelsus (1493 – 1541) mentioned **elementals** in
    his works, highlighting the hybrid quality of these entities, as **they are neither
    humans nor spirits**. In this post we’ll explain what is an elemental spirit and
    what types of elementals exist. Instead of the [Five Elements](https://spells8.com/topic/elements-of-witchcraft-wisdom/),
    we will use the classical view which recognizes four elements based on the four
    cardinal directions (North, West, South and East).

    can move through different planes. Likewise, they maintain a strong bond with
    Nature, which is why many cultures consider them protectors or guardians of the
    earth.

    it has been claimed that they are capable of assuming human form and other appearances.

    have a preponderant role in the growth of plants, flowers in particular. Sylphs

    is greatly comforted by your faith alone. Pay respect to the Eastern sky, or pay
    extra attention to the breezes that caress your cheek. To invoke the Sylph in
    your ritual or spell, practice different forms of breathwork, or gaze at clouds
    and stars. Look to Sylphs for inspiration and clearing mental blocks.
