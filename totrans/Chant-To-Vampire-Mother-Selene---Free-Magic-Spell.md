O dea tenebris

It is a fine chant, but I recommend using Google Translate if you do not speak Latin so you understand what you are saying, like I did, and I assume the author did too. I can see it as an invocation to the Moon Goddess Selene, and can be used in a ritual, but it will not turn you into a vampire, just call on her in worship.

You cannot turn into a vampire, period.

If anyone ever needs to talk to me they can mail me directly.

What does it say? In English language?

stop lying to these people

Tadashi is speaking the, you can work with Selene and use this poem in a ritual, but you cannot become a vampire.

I'm reading that website, and tbh while they make it seem realistic, it is not. The ''headache paradox'' as they call it, can be explained simply. While your brain does not have nerves, the tissue surrounding it does. Pressure put on those nerves causes pain. Paradox explained. Vampires cannot possibly exist. Immortal? We are carbon based bodies. That cannot be changed. Carbon does in fact degrade, which is why we age. Please. Do explain how a human body could possibly become immortal and survive on the very few nutrients in blood?

Literally every post I see you denying that this stuff doesn't work are you getting paid for this because do you Keep coming back to the website

Dayday, the point of this site is to share information and experience. Sometimes that means using one's experience to explain a piece of information is misleading. Or even outright wrong. That is a part of sharing knowledge. Failing to correct a falsehood in the name of being nice achieves nothing but perpetuation of the error. That is a thing which does no one any good.

Um pain is a illusion.

I understand the philosophical point you're trying to make, but we have pain receptors that send a signal to our brain when we are injured. We can be tricked into feeling pain or worse pain, depending on the circumstance, but if someone got stabbed, the pain receptors would send a signal saying ''we've been hurt, get out of this situation now'' [and yes, you have adrenaline which would dull the pain receptors for a time, but once the shock wore off, the pain would return]

Will turn you into a vampire don't worry what people say only believe the word of the goddess that's why humanity believe that nothing can be done to be a vampire because of people who post on spell that it can't turn you like they are paid ads so ignore them and believe and your self and any spell will work

As fun as it would be, believing something does not render that thing real. No matter how fiercely you believe it. Jump, believing you will fly, and you will still find yourself landing on the ground in short order. Reality does not care whether you believe in it or not. It is still going to be real.

This is coming from someone who has been within the vampiric communities for many years as a person of support and donation, who has had many discussions with many people. Who has worked with and for the energies and emotions involved. Who has done shadow work and healings, with one or two times where a person has left their vampiric nature behind. Or, at least, taken steps towards that goal;

Yes, there are some things which can lead a person to awakening/discovering, or beginning to become vampiric. But the process does not lie in a spell, pact, or prayer. There is no light-switch to flip. And it does not present itself as beneficial or even distinctly supernatural/beyond what a normal person could achieve. Nor does it make a person stronger, long lived, unique, or special. It is an affliction of predispositions that creates difficulties in life. It does not remove them.

That is the reality that exists, while the reality people want is completely different. That is why we collectively say that spells and prayers like this one are not real. Because they will not give you what you are looking for. That is assuming you have taken the time to consider what you actually want, and/or why you (the collective you) think you want what you believe being a 'vampire' could provide, to begin with.
