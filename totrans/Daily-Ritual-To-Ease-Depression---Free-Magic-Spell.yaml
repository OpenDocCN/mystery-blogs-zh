    If desired, anoint the candle with rose or lavender oil prior to lighting. Sit
    before the candle. Let its soft light and the sight of its dancing flame calm
    you. Then, take the lavender and rose quartz charm in both hands and speak the
    following:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Continue to hold the charm in both hands as you focus loving, peaceful energy
    into it. Sit before the candle with your charm for as long as you like, and when
    you feel ready, snuff out the candle. If possible, time your ritual so that might
    go to sleep for the night immediately after.

- en: After charging your charm, sit quietly with it for at least a few minutes every
    day. Clear your mind of all thoughts and hold it in your receptive hand, letting
    its energy soothe you and fill you with hope. Meditate like so for as long as
    possible.

- en: When not using the charm, keep it on your altar or some other safe place, preferably
    covered with a white, pink, or light blue cloth. The lavender should dry and stay
    intact, but if it should wither or break, simply replace it with another sprig.
    Re-charge your charm as often as you feel you should. You may use the ritual described
    above, or you may simply leave it in moonlight or charge it in some other simple
    way the charm will know its purpose and your intentions after its initial consecration.
    If you replace the lavender or any other part of the charm, however, you may wish
    to repeat the full charging ritual.
