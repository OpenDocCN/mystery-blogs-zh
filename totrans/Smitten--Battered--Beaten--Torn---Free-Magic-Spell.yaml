- en: Light two black candles on the alter you have worked up the negative energy
    and your anger has built... take the Voodoo doll and visualize with intensity
    that it is your enemy before you. You may even cut out the face on a picture of
    your victim and glue it to the head of the Voodoo doll. If you have any nail clippings
    or hair follicles or any small item that has the victims vibration on it, you
    can place it inside the Voodoo doll. That will make it a much stronger connection
    and all the more powerful. Once you have worked up the negative energy and your
    anger has drawn near its boiling point... slam it to the alter and stab one time
    at the doll in the place where you wish to afflict pain. Then take another pin
    if you so desire and prick the doll once again in a place where you wish to afflict
    more pain. Each time you stab at the Voodoo doll make sure you are visualizing
    that you are actually inflicting pain on your enemy. Do not touch the pins after
    you have placed them. While doing this, recite the following incantation....

    leaving the pins that are already there alone. Do not touch the pins after you
    have placed them. Once again, if you touch any of the pins after they have been
    placed, the Curse will come back on you. Backfire!
