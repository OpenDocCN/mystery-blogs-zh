    have a friend drum a very steady, continuous beat. (This is a traditional method
    to shape-shift.) Or play music designed for relaxation, which can help you enter
    into an altered state of consciousness.'

    another person. Involve all your senses. Imagine what you would smell, taste,
    hear, and feel. For example, if you become a wolf, imagine having an acute ability
    to smell. If you become an eagle, imagine your eyesight to be very sharp and far-seeing.'

- en: When you can see the world through the experience of something else, it deepens
    your compassion profoundly. For example, if you’ve had a terrible argument with
    your spouse and you shape-shift to view things through his or her eyes, you might
    find that your anger subsides. Or if you’re depressed because you were passed
    over for a job promotion, you might shape-shift to experience life through the
    eyes of a robin and ultimately realize that the universe is much more vast and
    wondrous than the arena of your job. Your depression pales in comparison to the
    joy of flight and the exhilaration of bursting into song.

- en: Sometimes I imagine myself seeing through the eyes of another person. When I
    can see the world through his or her eyes, it allows me to have greater compassion
    and understanding. I’ve found this particularly helpful when I’ve been having
    a challenging time with others. When I view the world through their eyes, I’m
    usually less critical of them.

- en: Activating the native spirit within you means that you recognize that we live
    in a mysterious, splendid universe. You know that Creation is filled with spirit
    beings, land spirits, little people, angels, and ancestors; and you know there
    are ways to travel into these realms through vision quests, storytelling, dreams,
    astral traveling, and shape-shifting.

- en: Once you step into a native perception of reality, the universe becomes much
    richer and fuller. In a very practical way, this allows you to see the truth in
    life. Instead of believing what you hear and see, more often you believe and trust
    what you feel and know in your heart. You’ll find yourself being aware of the
    deeper truths in life and making decisions accordingly. This can positively transform
    your life.

    do not encourage appropriating another cultures ritual, seeing things from another
    persons perspective is important and should be encouraged.
