    ruler of the Solar system. When talking about Saturnian energy, the key phrase

    this phrase, as the energy they receive is consistent, steady, and unyielding.

  zh: 摩羯座的太阳人从土星那里获得能量，土星是太阳系的纪律统治者。谈到土星的能量时，关键词是“缓慢而稳定地赢得比赛”。摩羯座的太阳人正是这句话的典范，因为他们接收的能量是稳定、持续且不屈不挠的。
- en: Saturn’s energy is much like that of an old man, so when it is reflected back
    at the Sun in Capricorn person, the energy comes with a sense of responsibility.
    They use this energy consistently, but when it runs out, there is no more where
    it came from and they must rest until more energy comes.
