    fair to say that humans get their energy from the sun– the sun grows the food
    which feeds the animals which we then eat, and feed our physical bodies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, we do have three other bodies that need the flow of energy as much as our
    physical one. The emotional body, spiritual body, and mental body are what we
    call our *energetic bodies*— and these must receive energy in a different way
    than our physical body.
  prefs: []

    affect us a lot on a daily basis: everyone has those days, or periods, where they
    just don’t *have the energy* to get something done– no matter how hard they try.'

- en: When we discuss astrology, and talk about how our charts affect our lives, our *sun
    sign* is how we get energy to our energetic bodies. When looking at this, its
    important to talk about rulership– I find modern rulership to be more important
    than traditional rulership when talking about the flow of energy.
  prefs: []

    we get our energy. When these planets go into retrograde, that means that there
    is *no new energy* going to our energetic bodies– which is why you are *more effected*
    when your ruling planet goes into retrograde.

    planets to earth, and only goes into retrograde once a year, so Martian people
    tend to have a lot of energy to expel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People with Sun in Aries tend to have *an abundance* of energy at their disposal–
    and they may act in spurts when going through life. When they have the energy,
    they use it. When they tire, they tire quickly and need to rest. However, it may
    only be a twenty minute nap to give a Sun in Aries person back their energy, just
    as another Martian spurt begins again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sun in Aries people feel the best when they use their energy actively and continue
    working on their projects. Mars is a very volatile planet in terms of energy,
    so a lot of times a Sun in Aries energy may come out as anger, or a violent assertion
    of their drive. This is okay, and Sun in Aries people should learn to work *with *their
    energetic spurts instead of against them. Often, at the times when a Sun in Aries
    person is most angry, they are also the most driven.

    Their drive is gone, there is no new solar energy coming towards them, and even
    though nothing really *changes* in their life, they just no longer have the energy
    to get things done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on themselves, or completely depressed. They may try to get energy from *old*
    Martian things– which may come in the form of bringing up old fights, investing
    in *past* projects, or holding old grudges. It is important to note that when
    Mars goes into retrograde, the sexual energy of the Sun in Aries person will also
    be depleted.

    energy from the reflection of the Sun on Venus. Venus is a very smooth planet,

    energy than Sun in Aries people.
  prefs: []

    and go about their day.
  prefs: []

    is flowing since Venus is one of the closest planets to the sun. Venus moves quickly,
    so Taurus and Libra people also move very quickly with their actions throughout
    life, but these actions are quick and *steady, *rather than abrupt like Sun in
    Aries or Martian energy. In fact, you may not even notice the enormous strides
    Sun in Taurus or Libra are making until they are made.

    some kind of energy from their looks, but this will all be from the *past* because
    when Venus goes retrograde, there is no new solar energy.

    Mercury, which is the fastest moving planet and the one closest to the sun. When
    Mercury is direct, Gemini and Virgo have *an abundance *of energy and can get
    things done quickly and meticulously.
  prefs: []

    critical thinking skills, and have their mental bodies especially active when
    Mercury is direct. Their energy comes in spurts, similar to Martian energy but
    not as aggressive. These spurts may last from days to weeks, where the Mercury-ruled
    person acts as though they are *driven by a motor.*
  prefs: []

    is *old*, and there is no new Solar energy heading their way. This is why Gemini
    and Virgo are known as unstable signs, because for 2/3 of the year, they are happily
    living their lives and going on their way, and then for 1/3, they have the rug
    pulled out from under them and have no energy to get anything done.
  prefs: []

    is really just a depression of energy, but being mercury ruled, it may come out
    as aggressive language.

    of this lack of energy.

    overnight so they are rejuvenated in the morning.
  prefs: []

    the most nourished of all their energetic bodies. When the moon is large in the

    very emotionally to this energy.

    from the sun and from Earth, and also has a fairly small surface area– being the
    smallest planet. Because it takes the sun so long to reflect its light off of
    Pluto and back onto Earth, Sun in Scorpio people are typically pretty depleted
    in energy.
  prefs: []

    in life, and are always kind of dragging their feet. They may even feel a bit
    abandoned by the sun, because it does not energize them as effectively as it does
    other people, and it takes so long for them to build up any energy.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    energize them and make them feel a bit more alive. They should also try to get

    body may have some effect on their energetic bodies as well.

    this phrase, as the energy they receive is consistent, steady, and unyielding.
  prefs: []

    at the Sun in Capricorn person, the energy comes with a sense of responsibility.
    They use this energy consistently, but when it runs out, there is no more where
    it came from and they must rest until more energy comes.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sun in Capricorn people should not expect to get things done quickly, but instead
    should focus on doing them well over a long period of time. Stress comes very
    naturally with Sun in Capricorn, and giving yourself a quick deadline will always
    lead to more of it, which will deplete the little energy Saturn has doled out
