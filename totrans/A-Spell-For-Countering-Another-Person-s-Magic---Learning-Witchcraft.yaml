- en: Add three drops of some rosemary essential oil into your carrier oil. To charge
    it, roll the mixing bottle into between your palms, while your thoughts are focused
    on the purpose of the spell you are weaving. Light your white candle, and focus
    on its flame, to see whatever person you believe is acting negative towards you
    and see them growing smaller and smaller.

- en: Use the charged oil to anoint your purpose candle. Draw away the oil from you
    while you are banishing the thing that has been directed at you. Before you light
    the candle, write “all blocks are gone” on your piece of paper. Then fold up the
    paper three times. Light your candle and use the flame to set the paper on fire.
    Focus on the flames, and say the following words three times, and then on the
    final time say “let it all be done, and that it harms no one.”
