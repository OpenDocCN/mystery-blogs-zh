    Bless this circle and myself with your powers and your grace. And at the same
    time, bring to me the wisdom and understanding of those witches that lived before
    me. Help open my mind and with the guiding power of the full moon bless me." Follow

    past, to the inner temples and caves of the past. See and wonder as you see these
    shamans and witches perform their rites of magic and paganism. Hear their words
    and watch their arts. Remember them if you can. Do not rush this meditative process.
    Stay with it as long as possible. At least till the t-lights burn out (which is
    about 2 hours) The images you see should look not like a movie but like you are
    actually there. Refrain from inducing images from TV shows and movies, as these
    are not real and only confuse you. Let the images come to you. You should not
    only be able to see whats being shown but feel the ground and smell the air.
