    Full moon as it rises (Or perform this outside if the weather permits. Your altar
    should be simple enough to have room for the offerings. Set up any meditative
    music you think may help. Infront of the altar start forming a circle with the
    13 candles. the diameter should be wide enough so that in the center of the circle
    you can sit with your meditation pillow.

    me any powerful words of wisdom, any gifts of understanding, any powers that you

- en: Now slip into a meditative state. Think back, project the mind to times gone
    past, to the inner temples and caves of the past. See and wonder as you see these
    shamans and witches perform their rites of magic and paganism. Hear their words
    and watch their arts. Remember them if you can. Do not rush this meditative process.
    Stay with it as long as possible. At least till the t-lights burn out (which is
    about 2 hours) The images you see should look not like a movie but like you are
    actually there. Refrain from inducing images from TV shows and movies, as these
    are not real and only confuse you. Let the images come to you. You should not
    only be able to see whats being shown but feel the ground and smell the air.

    visions you had and wish to remember in a journal book. When done recording what
    need be, blow out the candles. Never snuff them out with your fingers as this
    is disrespectful. As you blow out each candle speak "With loves sweet kiss."

    you are in training. Each time you perform this, you should gain new insight and
    at the same time feel the witch inside you grow stronger.
