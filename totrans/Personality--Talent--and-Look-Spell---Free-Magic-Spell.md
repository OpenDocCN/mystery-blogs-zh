this could help, but be sure to actually be aware of what you need to improve and actually work on improving it, the spell can only do so much for you if you're not putting in the effort to change.

This can help you, and you can use the satchel as a reminder as you work towards your goal. This will not instantly improve your bad habits, but it should make change a little easier.
