- en: Claircognizance is a great psychic sense to have. It’s relatively easy to develop,
    but unless you’re especially gifted, claircognizant abilities typically don’t
    come out of nowhere.
  prefs: []

- en: Like any other skill, the development of psychic abilities takes time and practice.
    It can be difficult, however, to know exactly *how* to practice. Here are 5 wonderful
    exercises that are really effective for developing claircognizant abilities!

- en: 5\. Automatic Writing
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Automatic writing is an excellent way to practice claircognizance. Even though
    automatic writing is a specific type of divination all on its own, you can’t be
    successful at automatic writing without claircognizance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To practice automatic writing, you’ll need a comfortable place to sit, a pad
    of paper, and a pen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Touch the pen to the paper but don’t consciously write anything. If you hand
    starts moving, let it go without thinking and just write. It can take 5-10 minutes
    for automatic writing to begin, so don’t worry if nothing happens at first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have trouble separating your conscious mind from this exercise, try closing
    your eyes. Don’t open them or look at your writing until you feel completely done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At first, your writing may not make much sense. That’s totally normal. I recommend
    saving all of your practice in a notebook so you can refer to it later. You never
    know what symbols might show up!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are at our most vulnerable during sleep, so it’s a great time to practice
    using our unconscious psychic abilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think of a question that you don’t know the answer to. For this to work, you
    need to *want* the answer. Write your question on a piece of paper and tuck it
    under your pillow or inside your pillowcase.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Each morning, record the messages you received in your sleep. It doesn’t matter
    how random these messages or thoughts are: make sure to write them down! At some
    point, you may be able to piece together your dreams to discern an answer to your
    question.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of how advanced you are in developing your claircognizance or psychic
    abilities in general, I recommend doing this exercise when you’re struggling to
    get an answer. It’s always much easier to find the truth during sleep!

- en: 3\. Ask Yourself Questions With Flashcards
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I love using flashcards for psychic training! Flashcards are used a bit differently
    to develop claircognizant abilities, but they’re still very effective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this claircognizant exercise, you need to write a question on the front
    of the card and the answer on the back, but you’ll write the same questions on
    multiple cards, giving different answers on the back of each flashcard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, you might write: “What color is on the back of this card?” on
    5 flashcards. On the back of each card, you will write a color, making sure that
    you never repeat the same color. The answer on one card will be blue, while the
    answer on another card is green.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Shuffle the flashcards then practice answering the question using your claircognizant
    abilities. If the answer doesn’t immediately come to you, don’t worry: this is
    a difficult exercise.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re trying to answer the question on the front of the card, focus on
    opening your mind to allow knowledge to enter. Keep your mind blank so that information
    can flow through. When you do get an answer, even if you aren’t sure, go with
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s okay if you don’t get many (or any) answers at right in the beginning.
    Practice this exercise once a day and you’ll improve more quickly than you think!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most psychic information will come through your third eye or crown chakra. I
    find that claircognizant information tends to come through the crown chakra, at
    least for me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you haven’t worked on your crown chakra before then I recommend doing a meditation
    specifically to open your crown chakra. This will help you to receive a whole
    bunch of psychic information, but it will also enable you to gather energy through
    your crown chakra if you practice witchcraft, so I recommend this exercise for
    a variety of reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[This is a great crown chakra meditation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLxSpW35ELY)
    that’s only 15 minutes.'

- en: 1\. Meditate To Connect With A Claircognizant Spirit Guide
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re claircognizant or are focusing specifically on developing your claircognizance,
    you can ask for a spirit guide who will assist you on your journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those of you who have been practicing for a bit might already have this spirit
    guide. It can be helpful during your meditation to first ask if you already have
    such a guide. If you find that you don’t, then you can go on to ask if an evolved
    spirit will work with you to develop your claircognizant abilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are so many ways for you to connect in this meditation. First, I recommend
    going into a deep meditation by relaxing. If visualization works for you, then
    you can picture yourself going down an elevator, walking on a beach, etc. If visualization
    isn’t your thing, then you can simply sit in stillness until you connect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don’t need to literally hear your spirit guide in your head in order to
    work with them. Your spirit guide can reach you in many ways, such as through
    dreams, through signs, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you ask for a spirit guide to work with, you may start to notice more opportunities
    for you to use your clairvoyant abilities. Take advantage of this and trust that
    your spirit guide is assisting you by providing practice opportunties!
