My first spell as a member. This one I made up so, I haven't tried it yet.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Mermaid Spell That Maybe Works'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Something that symbolizes yourself (e.g a necklace, ring)

*   Real salt water from the ocean (or normal water but NEVER with chlorine)

*   A bowl

*   Yourself

*   Belief in God

*   Belief in God

1\. Pour the water into the bowl.
2\. Put your hand over the bowl and chant:
'Carus Deus Omnipotens, si ego sum vere vilis futurus a mermaid tunc tribuo mihi donum verto unus ut ego tactus unda.'
3\. Then, put your symbol into the water and chant three times:
'Carus Deus, sic mote is exsisto'
4\. Leave bowl with the symbol and water outside under the moonlight for a night.
5\. On the next day, wear your symbol but KEEP the water until you don't want to be a mermaid anymore.

PS: Whatever happens to you happened because it is God's will. Only in His power we will be as we are, so with all the magic in the world, don't forget to believe on God Almighty too. You will never know what gifts He will give us. Anyways, add me!

I love this title. This spell does not work, you cannot become a mermaid, physical transformation is not possible with Magic.
