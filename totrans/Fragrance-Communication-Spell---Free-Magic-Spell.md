**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Any incense/candle/oil that the spirit and you choose.

1.) Choose a specific aroma distributing item to identify your desire to communicate with the spirit.

2.) The next time you apprehend the spirit's fragrance, communicate aloud with the spirit.

3.) Explain that you would like to set up a formal system of communications, where you are an equal partner, rather than a passive partner, subject to whims of the spirit appearing as it chooses. (I know, it sounds rather impossible, but simply request it, you may get an answer.)

4.) Demonstrate your chosen fragrance to the spirit and explain that when you wish to initiate communication, that fragrance will be wafted into the atmosphere. It will not be used at other times.

5.) Ask the spirit for a sign that he or she is in accordance with this plan.
