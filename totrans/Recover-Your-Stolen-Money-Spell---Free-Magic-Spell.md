**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Pine Incense

*   I cup of salt

 Burn the Pine Incense and wave it over the salt. Do this for several minutes.

Chant:

Come back to me
That which has been
Unrightfully taken
Away with the wind
Return to me
Thief on the prowl
It is mine
I order you now
This spell is true
And harms no one
As I will it
It is done

Next, pour the enchanted salt in a path to your front door and before long your money will follow!

The money will not necessarily come from the pocket of the thief and into your hands, but the Universe will work it out in such a way that the thief will lose the same amount of money that you receive which will, of course, be the same amount they had originally stolen from you.
