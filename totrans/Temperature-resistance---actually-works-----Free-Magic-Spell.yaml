    show proof, but this one works and I have done it. This spell is not for beginners
    but for the intermediate level of witches.

- en: While you can use energy work to help you feel hot or cold in certain situations,
    it is an energy technique, not a spell. This spell probably will not work for
    most people outside of a placebo.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A placebo is something that tricks your mind into believing something is real.
    Your mind then tells your body it is real, and your body reacts physically to
    the influence of the brain. Sugar pills have been given to people, told they were
    actually medicine, and improvements in the persons health has been documented.

- en: So you're saying it won't work for most people so you're telling us that it
    can kind of work ? or you saying that the spell works like placebo?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This spell does not work as outlined. This spell can trick people and create
    a placebo effect. Energy work is not a spell. You need to know how to control
    and direct energy for spells to work. Think of it like a spell called ''running
    spell'' and the instructions were ''walk fast.'' Yeah, that is how running works.
    When you charge energy, you can feel warm. When you ground energy, you can feel
    cold. This is not a spell, this is the nature of Magikal energy.
