 ## Casting Instructions for 'To Spark Love between Two People'

*   Red marker

*   (Optional) Red ribbon

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 Red candles

*   2 White candles

*   Two small sheets of paper or cards

*   Red marker

*   (Optional) Red ribbon

Arrange the candles in a star shape, so if lines were connected between them they would form a pentacle. The red candles should be the top one point and the bottom two points, with the white candles the remaining points. Light your candles counter-clockwise.

Now, take your two pieces of paper/cards, and on one piece write the first letter of the first name of person A in the spell. Then, on the other piece, the first letter of the first name of person B. Place these two cards between the candles, in the center of the star shape as you chant.
Remember to replace the blanks with the two names of the people you want to bring together, and use proper his/hers for the situation.

Oh God and Goddess I come tonight
On behalf of another to share his/her plight
____ who has the love of none
Seeks ____ to be his/her one

Allow this union and keep it strong
Let these two do each other no wrong
Pull with force so strong these two together
Keep them this way 'till forever

Spell be told an' sealed and done
With trust that ____'s want be won
Hear me true and make hastily
As I will so mote it be.

After the chant, if you have the ribbon, you may tie the two papers or cards together tightly, and either keep them yourself, or give them to the person you have done the spell for. You must blow the candles out in the same order you lit them.
