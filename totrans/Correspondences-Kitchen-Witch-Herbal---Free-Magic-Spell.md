The herbs listed below should be easily obtained at any grocery store, and should not get a second glance from even the most rabid anti-magickal person

Some ways to include herbs in your spells are to simmer them on the stove in a pot of water, to include them in ritual foods or drinks, to burn them in a fire, or to place them in a bag, doll, or pillow. You can also scatter them on your working altar.
