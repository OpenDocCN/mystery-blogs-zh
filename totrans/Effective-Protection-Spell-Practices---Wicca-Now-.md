### How To Caste A Protection Spell

A protection spell is something you do with focus and intent in order to affect change. To put it simply, spells are a set of symbolic actions taken to activate change. When spellcasting, you function as the agent of change, directing and forming energy towards the desired outcome. Will spellcasting work instantly? Most probably not. Beware that magick generally takes time to manifest and you might not even notice the effects as they gently creep in bit by bit.

Protection spell and defense magick generally works with a specific set of intentions to help you cleanse and cast our negativity. A protection spell focused specifically on protection may have several facets, use it to:

*   protect something or someone from negative energy
*   protect yourself or someone else from a specific danger
*   defend against attack
*   maintain a general level of defence

Working with defensive magick might also involve the natural magic of herbs, protective symbols, cord magic or working with stones and other objects.

### Casting A Simple Protection Spell Step-by-step

*   To begin any protection spell, cleanse your space and any tools you might be using
*   clarify your intent (what you wish the spell to achieve)
*   visualise the desired outcome
*   perform the ritual steps
*   give thanks

### Basic Shield Protection Spell

*   Center yourself and ground your energy by taking 7 deep breaths. Imagine yourself drawing up the earth’s energy into your core with each intake of breath
*   Visualize the energy extending past your core and expanding to form a physical bubble around you. You can imagine this like a soap bubble, gently encircling your entire body. You can also expand this bubble to encircle your entire house or apartment etc if so desired.
*   Secure your visualization with a protection spell chant. It might be something like “I invoke this shield of safety. No dangers or ills can befall me whilst I am safe within its magical protection”
