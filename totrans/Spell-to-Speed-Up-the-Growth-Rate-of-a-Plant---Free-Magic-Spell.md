In theory, this should work. As the author stated, do not expect it to grow overnight. You are giving the plant extra energy, so if this works, you might see more flower, larger fruit, or it grows an inch instead of half an inch.

Can this spell allows user create their own type of plant ?

No, but with careful cross-breeding of closely related plants and selective breeding within the same species, you can do so. At the very least, you can breed your own variety of an existing plant.

Need to make a plant that doesn't exist yet

That's not how magick works I'm afraid. Research botany and cross breedings plants.
