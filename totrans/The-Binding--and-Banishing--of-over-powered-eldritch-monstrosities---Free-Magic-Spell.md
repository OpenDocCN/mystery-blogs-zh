# The Binding, and Banishing, of over-powered eldritch monstrosities

This spell is in two parts, and it is easier in complete silence. It is used to bind and banish beings of great power, and I'm talking demigods and Lovecraftian abominations - hope you never have to use it.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'The Binding, and Banishing, of over-powered eldritch monstrosities'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A silver pentacle (optional)

*   An overpowered eldritch monstrosity (obviously)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A silver pentacle (optional)

*   An overpowered eldritch monstrosity (obviously)

To begin with, if you are surrounded by screaming people, say clearly, and put a lot of energy into it, ''Silentium circa meus'' (lit. Silence around me). If done correctly, everyone around you should lose their voice.
Begin building up even more energy - and I mean ridiculous amounts of energy.
Face the monstrosity and trace the first line of the pentacle in the air (or if you have a pentacle just hold it up) and say:
''Grounded, thou art,
The earth seals and binds
Thine power to destroy.''
Then, trace the second line and say:
''Fire scorches thine energy
Burning away what used to be
Thine power to remain.''
Third line traced:
''The cruel winds gust
Tearing away
Thine mortal form.''
The fourth line is traced here. Make sure you are practically overflowing with power.
''Water rages
Eroding thine bonds to thy master.''
The fifth line is traced here. As you say the following incantation, release all the energy you have been building up all at once.
''Homo apud Deus'' (man among God)
''The gods have heard my prayer
The gods will stand behind me
And add their might to mine.''
After you have released the energy, watch the monstrosity wither away and murmur:
''You
Who came unbidden
To wreak havoc upon this world
I say: Enough.''
Then leave, as fast as possible. If this doesn't work, then run away without saying the last part. I mean, no one will blame you for fleeing a demigod... Right?
