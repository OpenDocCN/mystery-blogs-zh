- en: Most of us look for powerful spells to overhaul our lives. Sometimes, it is
    better to use some simpler spells that can have a profound effect by making marginal
    changes. One example is when you want to use magic to feel more confident in your
    appearance.

- en: Are you trying to feel more confident about your looks? Women in particular
    are under a lot of pressure to look pretty. Despite making a lot of progress towards
    gender equality over the past 100 years, there is still a strong expectation for
    them to look great. They often turn to white magic to feel more attractive.

- en: Your hair is one of the most noticeable parts of your body, so making it grow
    long and look nice is important. Instead of casting a complicated beauty spell,
    you might want to try casting a simple spell that makes your hair grow faster
    and appear more radiant. Here are five spells that will do just that.

    If you don’t have such a room, you can go outside to do the ritual. However, it
    is important that we look for a place where you can concentrate and where nobody
    bothers you.

- en: Light the white candle. This is the color of the positive energy, of the Moon,
    an essential color for rituals like this one. Once you have lit the white candle,
    place the silver plate between you and the candle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take the scissors and cut a small lock of your hair. A small sample will suffice
    to carry out the ritual. Leave it on the plate and pour the revitalizing infusion
    over it. Let everything mix for a few minutes. While the concoction is mixed into
    the infusion, visualize yourself with hair as long as you would like to have it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After mediating a little while, take the mixture and put it in a small plastic
    bag. Take the bag in your left hand and bury it near your home. It will be more
    powerful if you bury it in the same place where you performed the ritual. It can
    also be in a house pot or at the base of a large tree where it won’t be disturbed.

    than it was before you started the ritual.

    first time. If not, you will have to wait seven years to try it again.
