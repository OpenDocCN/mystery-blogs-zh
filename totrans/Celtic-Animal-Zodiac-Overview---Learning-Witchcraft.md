> 来源：[https://learningwitchcraft.com/celtic-animal-zodiac-overview/#0001-01-01](https://learningwitchcraft.com/celtic-animal-zodiac-overview/#0001-01-01)

There is more than one type of zodiac that individuals study and follow. For example, many people are familiar with the Greek zodiac, the type seen by most and represented the most.

The Greek Zodiac is focused on the sun and the moon. Twelve divisions or signs are part of the formation. Those signs include Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Pisces, Aquarius, and Leo.

The Greek Zodiac is different from the Celtic Animal Zodiac. The latter is a form of astrology with Wiccan traditions.

What is Wicca? It’s a pagan religion (a religion that does not follow modern traditions, such as Christianity) that appeared in England in the 20th century and born from ancient pagan rituals.

Celtic Wicca is a contemporary tradition of Wicca that focuses on Celtic mythology. The Celtic Animal Zodiac is a form of this belief.

Born from a desire to honor and respect nature and the environment, the zodiac focuses on an animal that is most important during the season and month of an individual’s birth.

There are 13 different animals represented. By studying each animal and their representation, Wiccans believe you can better understand yourself and live a better life.

## Deer

**December 24 to January 20**

The Deer is associated with goals and motivation. A person who is born within these dates has high beliefs and high aspirations.

They would be the type of person who would write their goals down and work to achieve them. There’s a term that is often used with goal setters – “never give up.” A person born under the Deer sign would never give up. They would continue with their goals until they reached their dreams.

People born under this Celtic animal may have doubts, but unlike those who quit at the first sign of stress or anxiety or lack of belief, this person would acknowledge that the road ahead is not easy and that the only way to get to the end of the road is to keep pressing on.

## Cat

**January 21 to February 17**

People born under the Cat in the Celtic Animal Zodiac are blessed with the gift of intellect and wit. If there is a problem that needs to be fixed, but that requires an above average intelligent and an ability to be good at logic, a person under the Cat has that ability.

Like a Cat, however, they have an independent streak, which means that they may not follow conventional wisdom. That is, however, a good thing, because it sets them apart from the rest.

In addition to being intelligent, people born under the Cat are artistic. They can come up with intelligent creations and unique ways to develop a vision. Without people such as those born under the Cat, the world could be filled with “robots.” Everyone would think and act the same.

## Snake

**February 18 to March 17**

Those born under the Snake are cool as a cucumber, but they are also a lot of fun. They are not people who let things go without questioning them, even if it’s all an internal process. They’re always thinking and always figuring things out.

Some people can express themselves well and then some people can’t. Those born under the Snake are excellent communicators who have the “gift of gab.”

They are persistent. Indeed, if they see something that they want, they can figure out how to get it. Also, they like to call the shots when it comes to getting what they want. They’ll go with you if you follow their plan, but they are likely to resist you if you begin to put up roadblocks in pursuit of the plan.

## Fox

**March 18 to April 14**

Those born under the sign of the Fox can get the entire room to fall in love with them. There’s a term, “sly as a fox.” That term connotes someone who can’t be trusted, but that’s not the case with this Celtic animal sign.

People born under this sign can be trusted, and they can be loyal. When it comes to seeking a good friend, a person born under this sign could be your friend for life.

They can be a fun friend with a thirst for adventure. Then after your adventures are done, you can talk to them and tell them everything.

They will listen to you, and they will care. That’s part of what makes this person such a great friend.

## Cow or Bull

**April 15 to May 12**

If a person is born within these dates, he or she has many of the distinctions that are associated with the bull. They are strong, and they can be stubborn.

However, the stubbornness is typically born from the ability to know the truth from lies. You can’t fool a person born under this sign. If you’re not honest, they will know.

Bulls also have excellent taste in everything from clothing to furniture. They are the people you would turn to if you want advice on how to make fashion and furniture look good.

Because the Horse is so confident, that confidence exudes. Thus, people are drawn to the confidence. Horses are beautiful and regal, and those are often characteristic s of this particular sign.

## Salmon

When you think of uniquely intelligent, creative people, the Salmon Celtic animal sign comes to mind. These are the people who come up with the most creative ideas, ideas that the average person is incapable of forming.

As a result, these are the people who become famous inventors or famous writers or poets. Their creativity is so strong, their creations become symbols that the rest of the world follow through the passage of time.

There are times when their creativity is so unique that they are misunderstood. However, the bottom line is that their brilliance is eventually respected, no matter how advent garde the idea may be.

The Swan demands the best, but they are not judgmental against others who may not hold the same standards. People born under this sign are perfectionists. Everything looks good and runs smoothly because this is what is expected and desired.

Organization and efficiency are the hallmarks of this sign. Laziness and inadequacy are not the goals of the Swan.

## Butterfly

Although the Celtic Animal Zodiac is studied and appreciated by pagans and Wiccans, you do not have to be a Wiccan or a follower of the Celtic traditions to take advantage of the meaning of the zodiac.

As with the Greek zodiac, matching your birth date with the animal sign can help you to understand yourself and your habits. It can also help you deal with your family, friends, and neighbors.

Celtic Animal Zodiac is an alternative way to look at your place on the calendar and your personality traits. Unlike the Greek zodiac, your relationship with animals becomes paramount in your personality and your habits.
