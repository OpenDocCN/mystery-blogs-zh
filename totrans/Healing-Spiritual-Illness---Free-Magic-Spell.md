A spiritual illness can be felt in a variety of ways. There may be a feeling of being totally drained, usually a result of depression (which is an illness of the spirit as well as of the mind), there may be addictions, there may be a string of bad luck, poor social relationships etc. Spiritual illness can also produce physical illness.If it is you that is suffering from this illness, cast a circle and then visualize white light streaming from above into you. You should be able to feel this light like a warm wave of love. It is the love of The Goddess and of the spirits of your ancestors and guardians that you carry with you always. Concentrate on realizing that you are a Star of God sent into this world for spiritual experience and that the difficulties you are experiencing are only temporary and are a necessary part of your journey to spiritual enlightenment.Incantation:Great Goddess and all you spirits of love that surround me, bring me blessings.Be with me now and forever.If this healing is for someone else, you will of course have to persuade them to be involved in this-if the person is a big cynic, this can be a difficult task, so perhaps one of the other healing spells would be a better choice. But if the person is into it, cast a circle, then, as before, visualize white light streaming from above, into your head, and through your body. Then lay your hands (which will probably have a slight to moderate tingling feeling) on the person and send the energy flowing into them.Incantation:You are filled with the white light of The God/dess.You are a Star of God.You are surrounded by loving spirits.Great God/dess and all you spirits of love that surround (person's name), bring him/her blessings.Be with him/her, now and forever.

does this work?

The visualizations are common energy-working techniques, and they are combined with a basic chant to bring focus onto the intent of healing (along with being an appeal for help from higher sources).

The principles behind this working are simple, but sound. It would be a good way to attract and bring inward ideas of health, peace, and connection with the divine. I would recommend adding slightly to it though. While visualizing the 'drawing down' of the white light, positivity, and loving warmth try to imagine it as not just coming to you- But filling you with it, washing over you, and releasing the tensions, fears, worries, and heaviness of any overall dis-ease within you. Like the water from a warm shower washing dirt off of your skin.
