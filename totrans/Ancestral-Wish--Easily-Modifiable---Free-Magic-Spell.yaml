- en: Meditate and cleanse. Then sit cross legged with person whose wish you are fulfilling.
    Set out the object for the Wish and have your family member put their finger on
    the part of the object that will help most with their Wish. Ask them to state
    it out loud clearly. Then hold the moonblessed item to your lips and chant for
    your favorite ancestor an ancestor very important to your family to help grant
    the Wish. Then seal the broken item with tape and state that until the piece breaks
    the Wish will have to come true. If it doesn’t come true by then your ancestors
    may not want to help you fulfill this. Finally keep the items all in a dark space.

    This is only to be done as kindness for others. Seal the spell once your Wish
    is gotten by a prayer to your Ancestor**. **This is to be kind to them. Do not
    ask for help of the living. And be respectful of them and also gift them rewards
    if you like to!***'
