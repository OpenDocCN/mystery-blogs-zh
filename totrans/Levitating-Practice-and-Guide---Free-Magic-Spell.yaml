    Coven rituals). That will clear the mind, thus it shall be easier. Though, it

    imagine you are in the sky, birds around you, chirping and singing. Now imagine
    you are floating over water, the seashores rising up against the sand and relaxing
    sound of water. Now imagine floating over a rock in a graceful field, animals
    lurking, yet not fighting, around you. Now imagine yourself back in the sky, and
    repeat this over and over again in your mind.

- en: Keep in mind though, do NOT fear flying. That will take away concentration and
    you will probably fall. If you'd like to prevent yourself from fear of heights,
    I suggest going to somewhere high and looking down. Then imagine yourself falling
    from that point without screaming, and you land gracefully without a scratch.
    I recommend the Empire State Building, but if you can't, maybe just a cliff or
    your roof, or an oversized rock.

- en: I really want to levitate. It's weird because the only reason is it's the only
    constant power I have in dreams. No matter what, I'm always able to fly. It started
    out as simple levitation but I got more control over it and now I can fly. I wish
    I could do this in real life.
