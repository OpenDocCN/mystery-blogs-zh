  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Satan looks out for his own. Satan gives us an inner strength and we become
    very strong in spirit. Unlike right hand path religions, where adherents are forever
    praying and searching for their god, Satan comes to us on his own. Many times,
    we can feel him. He comes to guide us when we get down, worried, or are experiencing
    problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He snaps us into line and directs us as to what we need to do to be focused
    and happy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The foundation of Spiritual Satanism is in our finishing Satan's work upon humanity.
    This is the goal of the godhead, and is accomplished through power meditation.
    Humanity is currently at a very low level spiritually. When we begin to meditate,
    we experience profound positive changes within our lives. Satan and his Demons
    (The Original Gods) protect us and look out for us as we transform and achieve
    personal power.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Satan, we have protection that outsiders do not have. We can advance in
    the powers of the mind and soul as far as we wish. For outsiders, this can prove
    dangerous.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Satan also gives us knowledge. ''I lead to the straight path without a book.''
    As we transform and grow, our lives change for the better and we are much happier.
    We learn through Satan how to take control of our own lives and destiny instead
    of being at the mercy of fate. We learn to heal ourselves, and to fulfill our
    own desires, using the powers of our mind and soul.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In making a commitment, we engage a formal ritual. This is done out of free
    will. We are making a choice, as opposed to being dragged off to some Christian
    church, and reciting canned prayers (stolen and corrupted from Eastern mantras)
    in front of a bunch of idiots.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With knowledge and research, we can prove beyond all doubt that the nazarene,
    ''jehova'' and ilk are all fictitious characters, stolen from and corrupted concepts
    to remove all spiritual knowledge so that a ''chosen'' few can rule the world
    using powers of the mind and soul.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because so many have been forcefully indoctrinated with these characters, and
    what they stand for (Enemies of Satan), we renounce them permanently in the dedication
    ritual. This proves to be psychologically healthy and liberating.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initiation ritual is very personal, unless you decide to have friends participate,
    or are doing it as part of a group.
