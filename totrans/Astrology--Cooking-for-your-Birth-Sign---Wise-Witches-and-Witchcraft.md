## Gastronomy in the Stars

Students of the Zodiac go into great detail about each birth sign’s traits. They didn’t miss food! Astrology explains to us some tendencies and habits for what food a person likes, and even how the prefer it prepared. This is a fun exploration for [**Kitchen Witches**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/types-of-witches/kitchen-witch/), or anyone who wants to know what to prepare a menu for your next date!

## Of Foods and Fortunes

So your best friend is an Aries. You want to make something special. What do the stars tell you that might help make that meal more memorable? Here is a list of Zodiac birth signs and ideas about their culinary palates.

### Aries (March 21-April 19)

Aries is all about fire. Anything spicy tickles their tongue. Bear in mind that your always-moving Aries really does like to eat-and-run. Make finger foods for the road. This seems rather contrary to their HUGE appetite, but there you have it. Aries rarely worry about diets (we are so jealous). They enjoy rich food and would probably revel at the idea of making something new together.

### Taurus (April 20-May 20)

In the world of consumption your Taurus is an inspired foodie. Like Aries they enjoy a hardy meal but won’t rush all that lusciousness. Taurus eats with his eyes. Make sure your meal looks as good as it tastes, and don’t forget candles and centerpieces.

Give your Taurus pasta, sweet treats and fresh bread slathered in butter. Whatever you do, don’t say the word “diet” in their presence. The thought alone torments. Ask your Taurus partner for some of her favorite recipes that you can try for her next visit.

### Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Gemini guests lean toward cooking more than eating. They want good conversation, which of course gets interrupted with each bite. However, get your Gemini into a kitchen and watch the wonders created. Fusion cooking is definitely in the Gemini’s wheel house. No matter what he makes – you are going to love it.

The most important thing when cooking for a Gemini is remembering that variety is the spice of life. This is not the gal who wants the same thing three nights in a row, and she has no idea what an “eating schedule” looks like.

### Cancer (June 21-July 22)

When you talk to your Cancer about food the first thing she’ll do is show you her grandmother’s recipes lovingly held in a well-read book. Cancer loves food traditions and want to share them. In return, serve up some of your family’s favorites complete with the accompanying story.

If you know your Cancer is nervous or anxious, keep the meal light and healthy. Otherwise food becomes a coping mechanism. They will keep eating until they cannot move.

### Leo (July 23-August 22)

Feeding a lion is an expensive proposition. There is no skimping for this kitty cat. That gourmet steak and fancy side dish cost a bundle. Nothing but the best for your lion. Truth be told, they’re happier at a fancy restaurant than eating at home.

If that’s not possible, Leo enjoys company when dining. Family get-togethers are the best! Fill your meal time with laughter.

### Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Where Aries was spicy, Virgo is rather the “plain Jane”. People born under this sign have touchy tummies. When getting together with a Virgo consider letting them cook. Watching them work in the kitchen is nothing short of astonishing. Because Virgo craves perfection, every portion of the meal looks like it drifted from the pages of a culinary magazine.

When feeding your Virgo seek out recipes with the wow factor in flavor. Make the meal, and yourself, wholly irresistible. Never toss away leftovers in the presence of a Virgo. This is a huge food faux pas. Give those portions to your Virgo in a doggy back. They’ll make something of it later.

### Libra (September 23-October 22)

Libras live by the motto, “play in your kitchen and dance with your food.” This sign sees food like an elaborate play. Everything has its place and time. Get your book out on how to set a table again (they will notice).
Give your Libra flavorful morsels from a well-planed menu. Go from appetizer to dessert and an after-dinner drink in that order. Once you’re done putting things in the kitchen, Libra wants to sit and simply enjoy the moment.

### Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Scorpios always seem hungry but aren’t prone to over eating. Make sure to have plenty of “munchies” on hand for in-between meals. In terms of spices – the more, the better. Don’t go shopping for herbs with your Scorpio – you will never come home.

Before making a meal for your Scorpio gently inquire as to their preferences. This birth sign does not pad corners. A little research avoids a scathing review.

### Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)

Sagittarians are the people with whom you want to travel the world, testing every type of exotic fare. Movable meals please Sagittarius. They do have odd swings in their eating habits, though. One day they want nothing to do with food and the next they’re eating everything in sight. A lot of this behavior has ties to the Sagittarians zealous approach to life. When they get caught up, they forget to eat. When they eat, they want to be excited about it. Keep it interesting!

### Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

No matter how diligent the Capricorn, he will stop for a decent meal. You don’t have to cook a lot to keep your Capricorn happy. Make even one scrumptious dish, and he’ll be over the moon.

Don’t get to fanciful with the ambiance of your meal. Casual is “in”. Do what you can in creating a stress-free zone. DO make something traditional. There’s a ritual to eating for the Capricorn and you will see it as you go.

### Aquarius (January 20 to February 18)

Aquarians are the thinkers of the Zodiac. When they’re caught up in musing, a salad or yummy vegetables fit the bill quite nicely. In fact, your Aquarian may be a Vegetarian or Vegan – it’s in their makeup.

Being ever the non-conformist, Aquarians appreciate any attempt at creative or imaginative meals. Telling them how you came up with that idea makes it even better. They love all things fruity while avoiding caffeinated beverages.

### Pisces (February 19 to March 20)

For a Piscean the more sensual the dish, the greater the enjoyment. Pisceans are absolutely passionate about food. Cooking for them shows appreciation and thoughtfulness. It’s a true language of love.

When cooking for your Pisces they’ll enjoy subtle romantic touches. Bring the candles and you’re ready to eat. This guy or gal also relishes foods made with alcohol. A good wine reduction sauce send them to heaven.
