    into his or her eyes, and imagine them dying. Then take the scissors and cut the
    photog into tiny pieces. Pick them up and hold them in you hand. Put piece by
    piece onto the flame while saying

    he/she shall die. Once they are gone, I shall feel no remorse, feel no pain. This
    is how it was meant to be. Mess with me once, my blame. Mess with me twice, your
    flame. Kill him/her now, spare him/her no mercy. This is the will of all, so it
    shall be."'

    watching the person's picture burn and crumple. Think bout how much you hate them,
    and how happy you'd be when they die.

    wouldn't be so simple.

    goofer dust

    them, but they will not die.

    I think this spell might give them bad luck but not kill them.
