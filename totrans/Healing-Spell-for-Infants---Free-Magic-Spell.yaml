- en: This is a spell for infants that can be used for anyone, but it is highly recommended
    for children less than 1 year old. This is one that my teacher gave to me to work
    on, in which she edited and adapted and used for her own needs.

    the baby out of the water. You can work as a median to channel the energy between
    yourself and the child.

    them, then I have a spell for that too.

    being and the seat of healing love, which can be directed anywhere with your intention.

    the spirits for their help and send them on their way. Afterwards, you can spend
    a few minutes every day strengthening this shield, by sending some heart energy
    to your baby and visualise the cocoon being strong and healing.

    This seems like a lovely protection ritual calling on your spirit guides/deities
    to watch over your child. Alter it slightly and I can see it working for anyone
    like the author said.

    well. Bless you!
