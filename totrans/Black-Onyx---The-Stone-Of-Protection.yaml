    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [crystals for protection](https://wiccanow.com/crystals-for-protection/).
    Today I thought we’d focus on a specific crystal, namely black onyx.

- en: Black onyx is a variety of chalcedony and a cousin of agate. Onyx beads have
    been found in Egyptian graves dating back to 3100 BCE and the stone continued
    to be popular for a wide range of decorative objects throughout the Egyptian dynasties.
    The ancient Greeks and Romans were also fond of onyx and carved the stone into
    vases, cups, bowls and jewellery. The Romans in particular favoured cameo rings
    carved from onyx as they believed that when there was discord amongst people the
    stone would change colour.

    the stone has beautiful white bands laced throughout. Its surface can range from
    opaque to translucent and it often has a waxy lustre.

- en: This meditation requires a piece of real black onyx. A smooth piece of onyx
    is preferred but any real onyx crystal will do. You can also work with a piece
    of onyx jewellery if you don’t have a raw crystal at hand. This meditation is
    a wonderful way to calm and centre your energy before spellwork or anytime you
    generally need to find calm and balance.

    hand. Close your eyes and visualise a powerful stream of universal energy flowing
    from the stone and all around you. Visualise the blending of the two energies
    of night and dark, yin and yang as you feel their perfect balance surrounding
    you with calming vibes.
