- en: I also notice that Chiron in the 3rd house can relate to learning disabilities,
    such as dyslexia or ADD. These folks think a bit differently than others, and
    while there is nothing wrong with that, they inherently *don’t like* their differences.

- en: Occasionally, Chiron in the 3rd house can also refer to a wound with siblings.
    There may be past life trauma or wounds with these specific siblings, or the siblings

- en: The way to heal Chiron in the 3rd house is to speak your truth. Learn to value
    your own thoughts and opinions, and practice balancing gut instincts with logic.
    You will develop your own method of communication with enough practice, but you
