    consider Chiron to be an essential asteroid in the birth chart. Today, I’ll be
    looking at Chiron in the houses, as well as explaining how you can put your Chiron’s
    sign and house together to create one fluid definition.

    wound quite literally shows up in your sense of self, identity, and self-worth.
    Chiron is very conspicuous in the way that you present yourself.
  prefs: []

    health or appearance in some way. The wound often manifests in a physical nature
    as well as emotionally or mentally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    illness, or found some part of your body lacking, depending on the sign that your
    Chiron in the 1st house sits in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that Chiron in the 1st house can often indicate that the wound was either
    learned or cemented (if it was first learned in a past life) during childhood.
    Something about this person’s youth made this Chironic wound an integral part
    of the outer personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because Chiron in the 1st house is related to childhood, these folks can carry
    the Chironic wound through their inner child as they age. They might learn to
    hide it after a time, but the wound will always sit with the inner child.
  prefs: []

    appearance and personality. When you first meet a person with Chiron in the 1st
    house, you will see the wound right away.

    you present yourself. This will most likely point to the wound.

    clingy quickly.

    be especially strong. Chiron in the 1st house is more likely to present itself

    obvious to others but more obvious to the individual, although this is not always
    the case.

    might be especially obvious during childhood with Chiron in the 2nd house.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the sign that Chiron is in. For example, Chiron in Cancer may indicate a lack
    of emotional security or security regarding the home, while Chiron in Pisces can
    indicate a lack of spiritual security or the mental illness or addiction of a
    parent or caretaker.
  prefs: []

    money, the home, spiritual guidance, spiritual security, emotional security, mental
    security, physical security, etc. These people might feel like there is no guiding
    force in their life (lack of parental security) or they may feel that they are
    coerced into decisions and can’t develop their own inner self (lack of inner security).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    way in childhood. They may have had little to no affection, or the affection that
    they did receive was inappropriate in some way.

    how to provide the security you were missing *for yourself.*

    in the powers of the Universe and believing that everything happens for a reason.
    You will learn to discern that many societal constructs are just illusions. By
    figuring out what’s true for you and what the Universe means to you, you’ll develop
    your *own* sense of inner security.

    unsafe, creating a safe environment (in neighborhood with low crime rates, installing
    an alarm system, etc.) might help you to work through your Chiron.

    It is their own judgments of their differences (that are formed from society)
    that cause the issues.

    for the Chiron in the 3rd house individual.

    your own thoughts and opinions, and practice balancing gut instincts with logic.
    You will develop your own method of communication with enough practice, but you
    must first let go of the judgement that either you or society has cast on your
    mental abilities.

    your Chiron sign left (in a past life; the specific void will depend on Chiron’s

    getting hurt as they did when they were a child.
