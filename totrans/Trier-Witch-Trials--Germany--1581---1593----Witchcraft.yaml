- en: The witch trials that took place at Trier in western Germany in the years from
    1581 to 1593 was one of the largest in Europe. The persecutions started in the
    rural diocese of Trier in 1581 and reached the city itself in 1587, where it was
    to lead to the death of about 368 people. The number of deaths in the diocese
    as a whole is unknown.

  zh: 德国西部特里尔在1581年至1593年间发生的女巫审判是欧洲最大规模之一。迫害始于1581年的特里尔农村教区，于1587年传至市区，导致大约368人死亡。整个教区的死亡人数不详。
- en: 'In 1581, Johann von Schöneburg, a great admirer of the Jesuits, was appointed
    Archbishop of the independent diocese of Trier. To demonstrate his convictions,
    he ordered the purging of three groups of nonconformists in his diocese: the Protestants,
    the Jews and then the witches. Special accusers, inquisitors, notaries, jurors,
    judges and constables dragged to trial and torture great numbers of both sexes,
    all ages and all classes. Few of the accused escaped punishment by burning, and
    the victims included some of the leading men of the city of Trier (judges, burgermeisters,
    councillors, canons, parish-priests and rural deans of various collegiate churches,
    etc).'

  zh: 1581年，约翰·冯·舒恩堡（Johann von Schöneburg），一位耶稣会的忠实拥护者，被任命为特里尔独立教区的大主教。为了展示他的信念，他下令清洗他教区内的三个非主流群体：新教徒、犹太人，然后是女巫。特别的告发者、审判官、记录员、陪审员、法官和警官们拖着大量男女老幼各阶层的人进行审判和酷刑。被告中很少有人逃脱火刑的惩罚，受害者包括特里尔市的一些主要人物（法官、市长、议员、教士、堂区牧师和各个学院教堂的乡村教长等）。
- en: Between 1587 and 1593, 368 people were burned alive for sorcery in twenty-two
    villages (two villages were left with only one female inhabitant in each), of
    which almost a third were from the nobility, or holding positions in the government
    and administration. Dietrich Flade, the rector of the University and chief judge
    of the electoral court, expressed opposition to the persecutions and particularly
    to the use of torture, and consequently he himself was arrested, tortured, strangled
    and then burned.

  zh: 1587年至1593年间，在22个村庄中有368人因巫术而被活活烧死（其中两个村庄只剩下一名女性居民），其中近三分之一是贵族或担任政府和行政职务。大学校长、选举法庭首席法官迪特里希·弗拉德（Dietrich
    Flade）表示反对迫害，特别是反对使用酷刑，结果他自己被逮捕、酷刑拷打、勒死，然后被烧死。
- en: Another eminent scholar and professor at the University, Cornelius Loos, was
    imprisoned and forced under torture to publicly recant the views he had expressed
    in a book criticizing the persecution. His work, one of the first by a Catholic
    official to publicly oppose the witch trials then raging throughout Europe, was
    confiscated and suppressed by Church officials, and the manuscript was lost for
    almost 300 years.

  zh: 另一位杰出的学者和大学教授，康尼利乌斯·卢斯（Cornelius Loos），被监禁并在酷刑下被迫公开反悔他在一本批评迫害的书中表达的观点。他的作品是天主教官员中第一位公开反对当时在整个欧洲肆虐的女巫审判的书籍之一，被教会官员没收并压制，手稿失落了将近300年。
