- en: Composite charts tell us a lot about our relationships. They show us how we
    work together as a unit, how we present to the world (ascendant) and the ways
    that we stand out in the world. They are essentially a midpoint chart of the two
    individual natal charts, and act as a map for the rest of the relationship.

    is more of a map. The chart remains the same, but we can actively work to redirect
    the energy to more positive places.  This does not mean that the energy dissipates,
    the underlying energy always remains the same.

    in particular.  While Saturn aspects indicate the rules, structure, responsibilities,
    and tradition of the relationship, Uranus aspects do the exact opposite.  Uranus
    indicates the areas of life that we rebel from these norms, and how that will
    impact the relationship.

    nowhere to be found when bad times come.  External circumstances play a major
    role in this relationship, and it may feel as though the universe and the world

    and Juliet, where the situation of their love is rather erratic and rebellious,

    never understand the person, but trying to every day is the only thing that will
