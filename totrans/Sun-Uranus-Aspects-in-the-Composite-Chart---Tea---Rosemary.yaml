- en: Composite charts tell us a lot about our relationships. They show us how we
    work together as a unit, how we present to the world (ascendant) and the ways
    that we stand out in the world. They are essentially a midpoint chart of the two
    individual natal charts, and act as a map for the rest of the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the natal chart where things can be healed or fixed, the composite chart
    is more of a map. The chart remains the same, but we can actively work to redirect
    the energy to more positive places.  This does not mean that the energy dissipates,
    the underlying energy always remains the same.

- en: The Sun in the composite chart indicates the ego direction of the relationship.
    The Composite Sun is directional energy; what way the couple is directing their
    energy. Secondarily, it can indicate the way that the male or masculine partner
    acts in the relationship, specifically relating to squares and oppositions.

- en: The sun is the overall feeling of the relationship, and the aspects that it
    has affects that feeling or mood. Whatever sign the sun is in indicates the way
    that the couple feels about the relationship and the way they act towards it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Uranus is an exceptionally interesting planet when it comes to composite charts
    in particular.  While Saturn aspects indicate the rules, structure, responsibilities,
    and tradition of the relationship, Uranus aspects do the exact opposite.  Uranus
    indicates the areas of life that we rebel from these norms, and how that will
    impact the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Uranus is the planet of rebellion, unconventionality, science, the new age,
    and the way that we stand out in groups. In relationships, this often comes as
    the type of relationship the people want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a society, since Uranus entered Aquarius, its ruling sign, relationships
    have taken a turn for the unconventional. The energy is currently with these kind
    of new relationships, and composite aspects can show us how they work in our own
    charts.

- en: Sun Conjunct Uranus Composite
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Sun conjunct Uranus Composite, both partners tend to seek the relationship
    in order to escape societal expectations and rules. This may indicate a past negative
    experience with control or domination, so the couple finds themselves in a relationship
    that rejects these notions and creates rules of its own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Sun conjunct Uranus Composite, the partners tend to release old cycles
    and help each other come to terms with how fulfilling life can be.  They strike
    out on their own, discover life together, and try to help each other through the
    lows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These two come together to free themselves of limiting beliefs and ideas and
    focus primarily on unconditional love and existence rather than responsibility
    and reliability.  This aspect indicates an open relationship or the existence
    of a non-traditional relationship.  It also indicates that the relationship may
    be frowned upon by society.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Composite Sun conjunct Uranus means that sometimes, the person you rely on is
    nowhere to be found when bad times come.  External circumstances play a major
    role in this relationship, and it may feel as though the universe and the world
    is against the pairing.  The relationship’s essence *is* rebellion; being together
    is rebellion.  Perhaps the world has forbid it or there is something frowned upon
    about the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to remember the reason why you entered into the relationship.
    The person who gets into one of these relationships likely knows from the start
    that the nature of the relationship *is* instability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not a relationship for stability—it rocks all the foundations and creates
    an unconventional match.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A famous example of a Composite Sun conjunct Uranus relationship is in Romeo
    and Juliet, where the situation of their love is rather erratic and rebellious,
    and never sees stability. This is an extreme example of universal intervention. 
    Sometimes it may be more between the personalities that are unconventional, rather
    than the situation itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In platonic relationships, this indicates that the two people were brought together
    to offer new perspectives, and help each other break routines.  The other person
    is not what you expected, but rather what you needed to fulfill whatever destiny
    you have together.  It feels as though this person is breaking the mold for you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Composite Sun Trine Uranus, the relationship tends to feel very open and
    free. This is something that comes very naturally in the relationship, and may
    not have been planned, but it indicates that the two people had a similar situation
    in a past life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These two people are very responsible and understand that freedom is derived
    from their responsibility. They have rebellious fun when they so choose, but don’t
    live their lives on the edge or waiting for the next rebellious act. They are
    dedicated and hard workers and tend to necessities before pleasure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Composite Sun Sextile Uranus, the couples may prefer open relationships,
    as they require more individual freedom than other couples, especially the masculine
    one in the relationship. They may be more sexually or emotionally open as well,
    preferring many partners to one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These types of relationships may come off as detached or unfeeling due to the
    extreme openness of the relationship, and it is possible that both people may
    begin to feel unhappy. This type of relationship can grow and flourish into that
    of a Composite Sun Trine Uranus type of relationship, where they feel responsible
    to each other first and rebellious second, but that comes with hard work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Composite Sun sextile Uranus, the nature is to reject any kind of commitment
    and to work towards complete freedom, especially in the relationship. These couples
    either will become more responsible and lasting, or will burn out due to inability
    to commit.

- en: With Composite Sun square Uranus, the relationship feels like a whirlwind. 
    The couple likely met in a very odd way, like reconnecting with someone unexpected
    from the past, or meeting someone somewhere unexpected. With the Sun Square Uranus
    Composite relationship, the keyword here is *unexpected*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the relationship begins, everything is new, exciting, and impulsive. These
    people are likely to jump into a relationship without thinking about the consequences
    or responsibilities that comes with it. They are sure that they know each other
    and want to be together right off the bat, but they have no clue how they will
    change and evolve as the relationship progresses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that as things arise throughout the relationship, they will always
    be new and different challenges that never meet the couple’s expectations.  It
    also indicates that as individuals, they may be experiencing new and unexpected
    sides of themselves as a result of the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oftentimes, these *unexpected* situations cause conflict in the relationship. 
    It is likely that one or both people have expectations, which these situations
    keep causing to fall through. The couple may place blame on one another rather
    than just admitting that they cannot control the world around them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect has an underlying lesson—you are not meant to control another person. 
    Freedom is the ultimate form of happiness, and the relationship needs to develop
    into one where both people feel entirely free, but are *choosing* to commit to
    one another, rather than feeling responsible to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oftentimes, Sun square Uranus Composite may indicate that monogamy is not in
    the stars for this couple. Many of these unexpected situations may be other people,
    who each individual person longs for outside of the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Occasionally, if these feelings are not met with understanding, the masculine
    partner may step out or “act out” in order to gain what he feels is “true freedom.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because this aspect involves a square, there is some indication of fear here.
    One or both partners have a fear of true freedom, and either want to limit or
    be limited in their ability to exercise that freedom.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect does not indicate polygamy and cheating, but more indicates unexpected
    circumstances and warns not to be too controlling, or your partner will feel that
    energy.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the composite sun falls into opposition of Uranus, this indicates that
    the relationship came out of nowhere. It was unexpected, out of the blue, and
    at lightening speed—and since it began, neither person has been able to catch
    their breath.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the relationship progresses, there is excitement and surprise at every turn.
    An extreme example would be finding out that your partner was secretly leading
    a double life for the CIA, only to later learn that he was actually a Russian
    spy.  It feels as though no matter how much you know this person, you never *really*
    know them, because there is always something new to learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rules of the relationship may be extremely nontraditional, but its possible
    that neither of you is happy with this. You may want something more stable, but
    not know how to approach the issue with the partner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of times, you both have a separate list of rules that you try to impose
    on the other. Try to come up with with your own set of rules *together* rather
    than trying to make the other person fit yours.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The universe seems to work magically and mystically in this relationship. Forces
    seem to separate you at the least opportune times, and you may find yourself attending
    a wedding or party alone despite having checked multiple times that your partner
    was available that night.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding with any Uranus aspect is the key. Understanding that you may
    never understand the person, but trying to every day is the only thing that will
    help.  It is also necessary to learn that instability is a constant in this relationship,
    but if you choose to continue it, you are in for one hell of a ride.
