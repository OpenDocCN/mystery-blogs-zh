    your area of other energy. Set the picture of the person on the floor next to
    you (the picture is an aide and is not necessary). Focus on the picture. Clear
    your mind of other thoughts and emotions. Visualize this person speaking ill of
    you to others. Light the red candle. Hold either a completely dull knife, or your
    right pointer finger up to the palm of your left hand. Stare into the light of
    the candle and apply a slight twisting pressure to your left center palm. While
    doing this, visualize the other persons hand catching on fire and burning (while
    they are gossiping or bugging you). Visualize that person stopping what they are
    doing and the pain going away. Repeat this process from visualizing there hand
    catching on fire, to them stopping and it going out, three times. When finished,
    snuff out the candle, close your circle and clean up.
