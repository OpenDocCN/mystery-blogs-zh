You cannot shapeshift into a dragno.

Because Dragons are astral beings, we're physical beings, and magick doesn't contradict nature on the physical. Magick is a natural, neutral energy ruled by nature. Humans cannot naturally transform into other creatures, which is why magick can't do it either. You can work with Dragons [I do] but you can't become a Dragon.

This must be moved to Dragon Spell > Fantasy Section.(Wrong Place)

It's a glitch. Once you comment, it changes to ''Beauty>Attractive'' you can still find it in the Dragon section.
