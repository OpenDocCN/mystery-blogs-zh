- en: You’ll want to soak the basil leaves in water for around an hour before you
    start the ritual. Occasionally stir clockwise, but otherwise simply let them soak
    up the moisture. Once you’ve done this, consecrate the herbal water. Visualize
    your workspace while doing so.

    and begin walking through the workspace in a circle. Sprinkle the water as you
    go. You’ll only need a little.

    Do the same thing with the rice, the mint, and the ear of corn.

    until such a time as you feel it’s appropriate to remove them. Take the citrine
    to your workplace, and place it in the same drawer where you keep either your
    ledger or your business papers. Sprinkle the rice and corn around, and place the
    mint leaves in your wallet. Replace them with fresh leaves whenever you feel it’s
    appropriate.
