- en: Psychologists may argue that premonitions are the brain's way of processing
    information and making predictions based on patterns. **But can these patterns
    sometimes extend beyond the ordinary to touch the realm of the extraordinary?**
    That's the question we're itching to explore.

    every so often, a dream stands out with an intensity and clarity that begs for
    further examination.'

    a more general warning or insight? Sometimes the message is clear, other times
