## Advanced modern tarot interpretations of the Star card

I always like to examine other, modern decks to see what can be read into their symbolism.

 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

 Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

One modern, unconventional interpretation of the Star tarot card could be in the context of social media and online presence. In this interpretation, the card could represent the idea of “going viral” or achieving a high level of online visibility and fame.

 The naked woman in the card could represent the vulnerability and authenticity that is often required to connect with an online audience and to stand out in a crowded digital space.

 The water being poured from the jugs could represent the flow of information and the balance between sharing and receiving online. The eight-pointed star could represent the global reach and universal impact that is possible through the internet.

In this interpretation, the upright Star card could indicate that you are on the verge of achieving a high level of online success, or that you are well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities in the digital world.

 The reversed Star card could indicate that you are feeling uninspired or disconnected from your online presence, or that you are struggling to find your footing in the digital world.

 This interpretation of the Star card highlights the role that technology and the internet play in modern society, and the potential for individuals to make a big impact through their online platforms.
