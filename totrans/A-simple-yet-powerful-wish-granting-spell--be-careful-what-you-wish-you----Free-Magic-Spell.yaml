    is in your dream no request is too extreme''''. So you can use this spell to wish
    for whatever you feel in you want to wish for in your heart, meaning something
    you really want. So you could wish for anything, but you must believe and have
    faith in the process of spells. So don''t go wishing for something you know will
    never come true ( I''m pretty sure you know what I mean) (Spell added on: 3/24/17

- en: What are you wishing for? This spell could be flawed, you could be wishing for
    something not possible, or you might not be in the right place to receive it [you
    want a lover but don't love yourself for example] it could also be you need to
    wait longer for the spell. If you're wishing to become an architect but you haven't
    even gone to university for it, it would be a longer path for you than if you're
    wishing for a raise at work. If it's a longer goal the spell would work by giving
    you more opportunities to achieve that goal. Finally, I suggest making a vision
    board and using some of the law of attraction to help manifest your wish [again,
    provided its plausible. Anything that contradicts nature won't happen] good luck

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This would count as harmful to other people because that is their horse. They
    paid for it. Although you have somewhat good intentions, that would be harmful
    to tyour neighbours.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can. Regarding the ''harm'' point, only certain paths believe in ''harm
    none'' so it's not a universal law. You could cast a wish spell and the horse
    is gifted or sold to you at a price you can afford. I would suggest thinking before
    casting any spell. Think about ways it could harm another and if you're okay with
    that. Casting a job spells means taking the opportunity from someone else. But
    when you've been out of work for a long time, or are in a job you despise, it
    might be worth it. If you don't believe in harm to none, don't worry, but it's
    wise to at least look at the big picture just in case something unforeseen appears
    and you regret the spell you cast.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    time travel, but more likely you'll become proficient in past life regression
    [or the universe has a sick sense of humour and you discover old home movies]
    if you're hoping to physically travel through time it won't work.
  prefs: []

- en: Nekoshema...yeah. Honestly, some of the deities I've worked with do have a sick
    sense of humor (Zeus conjured up a sand-storm when I asked for a storm...thanks
    Zeus). So it wouldn't be that far-fetched for the universe to do the same.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's next to impossible to put a time frame on a spell since there are a plethora
    of factors you need to consider. If someone already likes you, fairly quickly
    [say within the first few days of the wish] if you live in a tower in the middle
    of nowhere and your only contact is your caregiver, then this spell might take
    a little longer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are types of wishes that are not able to come true cause it's impossible?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a pretty hefty list. The short answer is anything that isn't possible,
    like bringing back an extinct species, floating into the air, teleporting, time
    travel. In theory, you could wish for technology to make these things possible,
    but the chances of that coming true are ridiculously low. Wish spells are good
    for things in the realm of possibility but you can't find a specific spell.

    I never get hired, or even get an interview. It is a very well paying job, but
    I keep having to settle for low paying jobs that barely pay bills, and leave me
    with nothing at the end of the month. Could this wish spell make it more likely
    to get a certain job I've applied to?

- en: If you are missing a component/symbol that is called for in the working, there
    may be an alternative or substitute you could use instead. The items are there
    to be symbols. They represent your situation and goals or specific qualities you
    want to be reminded of and to draw inward. If you are missing something that you
    feel you need, research why it is there in the first place. What meaning does
    it have? What does it represent or symbolise. Then, go looking around for other
    things that have a similar meaning or representation. Who knows, you might even
    come across something that better encapsulates what you want to represent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As for handling the words of a spell, it isn't uncommon to read them out. However
    it tends to be a little less efficient for some. Ideally, if you haven't memorized
    the words, then continue to read and recite them until you can do it by heart.
    Consider it a part of the effort you are committing towards the spell-the more
    you put into it, the more you get out. All it takes to memorize the spell is some
    practice and repetition. (And patience)
