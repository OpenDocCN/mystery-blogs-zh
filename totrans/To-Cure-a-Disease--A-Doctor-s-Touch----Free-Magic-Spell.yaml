- en: A quick latin incantation with a strange throat-touch that will have SCP fans
    reeling away from you. Bonus points if you hum ''I am the cure'' eeriely, then
    message me with the reaction.

- en: The simple form of this, that I myself have used often when getting a cold or
    flu, quite easy. Sadly not as easy as just swatting the patient in the throat.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prepare yourself by discerning what the illness is. For instance, a cold may
    be less energy-intensive than an infected wound, but due to its nature is likely
    to re-adapt and attempt another infection. Once you understand what you're dealing
    with, pool a fair amount of energy in your hand. I personally use my index and
    middle finger, but I do not see why you cannot use your palm, or the webbing of
    your thumb if you want to go full spook. Simply anywhere you'd be comfortable
    holding a ball of energy roughly the size of a baseball, at least.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That exact energy type can vary. I myself prefer to use an electric blue akin
    to a gas flame to burn the disease from the inside out, but a cooler blue may
    work to freeze it out, and a darker crimson red may kick natural systems into
    overdrive. I have not experimented with the rainbow. Once you have a nice ball
    of energy resting on your chosen delivery system (look at me sounding doctory) you're
    ready to hand it over.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point, you want to begin with a hum in your throat/chest, raising it
    to a volume you can speak through. Once you can speak, hum the Latin phrase "**Remedium morbo**",
    or "The cure for the disease", if my already shoddy babblefish mind hasn't failed
    me yet. With this line, prompt the energy you hold to become active, a roiling,
    feral version of what you had made. Glowing, bold, tearing through itself looking
    for its prey - the illness. Then, touch the center of the disease. For, say, a
    nasal infection that may end up being a boop on the bridge of the nose. In my
    experience, for something more chest-and-head centered, a touch to the throat
    suffices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're unsure of exactly where to touch, or you're pulling a discreet heal,
    I'd recommend touching any 'blood zone', or any part of the body where blood rises
    close to the skin either by necessity​ ​​​​​​or to cool off. The back of the neck,
    either vein/artery in the neck, the insides of the elbows/knees, wrists/Achilles​
    ​​​​​​tendons, so on. Blood carries illness, after all, so it can carry our cure
    as well. If you are, indeed, trying to be discreet, humming Latin at your target
    may ruin that discretion. Thus, humming it before hand so you remember the tone,
    and 'replaying' that humming-voice in your mind ought to be a suitable replacement
    for the verbal 'lets go' signal.

- en: Remedium morbo is pronounced as it looks (Reh-med-eum m-or-bo), and as it means
    either "The cure for the disease", or "A cure for a disease", I'm not entirely
    sure how it will fare when fighting against multiple illnesses at once. Logically,
    more energy should offset the numbers/power difference. Then again, many things
    aren't logical.

- en: For a patient throwing a fit, I'd recommend a blend of lavender and spearmint
    put into a sachet or other "Here, smell this" item. Similarly, if you or your
    germophobe friend aren't comfortable with touching each other (I cannot phrase
    that better without sounding like a stuck-up, posh ninny) then oregano oil is
    not only a helpful delivery mechanism, in which you'd pool your energy rather
    than your hand, but helps by lending its own boost to the immune system. I, personally,
    use oregano-infused-coconut oil. But hey, you know what oil you like to drink.

- en: I had not considered this, originally, but there is nothing stopping you from
    forming the cure into it's ball, forming a nice, dense membrane around it like
    the gelatin-glycerin wall of a capsule, or the wall of an oversized cell, and chucking
    it at your patient. In hindsight, there may have been a reason for me saying "roughly
    the size of a baseball"
