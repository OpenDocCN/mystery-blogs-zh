    similar to Leo. This indicates a certain amount of talent for creative endeavors,
    but it can show a need for attention and recognition.

- en: In fact, because the 5th house can be very romantically-involved, Pluto in the
    5th house can indicate quite a lot about your relationships. As with any Pluto
    placement, this placement can cause toxic relationships, but Pluto also forces
    transformation for the better.

    This can feel terrifying, but you simply don’t know how to love without being
    completely devoted to your passion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, this can make you afraid of getting attached. You know that once
    you love, there’s no going back. I find that people with Pluto in the 5th house
    are often afraid of their own intensity (and the feelings that this intensity
    produces within them), especially as they age and learn how painful it is to lose
    something or someone.
  prefs: []

    chaos, and a general lack of boundaries. You probably have some trust and intimacy
    issues (and may get jealous quickly), but this is mainly because you’re afraid
    of losing the person you love.

    the world. You are consumed by your relationships, so when they end, you’re left
    not knowing who you are anymore.
  prefs: []

    you feel like there’s something missing.

    control your emotions, you may feel that they control you most of the time. You
    want to find balance but don’t truly know what that means, so you will exercise
    control in various ways to try and get a handle on your emotions.
