# How to summon an Angel through Sigils

This ritual teaches you how to summon an Angel to your location through Sigil Magick.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Paper

*   A Pen or Pencil

*   An Archangel Sigil

*   The Name of an Angel in Hebrew (if you cant find the Sigil)

*   A prayer, spell or ritual of cleansing

*   A private location

*   A votive candle

## Casting Instructions for 'How to summon an Angel through Sigils'

 1\. First, decide which Archangel you want to summon and look up their sigil online.  If you can't find the Archangel's sigil, use Google translate to translate the name from English to Hebrew (in case you're worried don't be, Hebrew on Google translate is actually very accurate).  Google Images is a good place to look for Archangel Sigils.

2\. Once you have chosen your Angel, draw the sigil (or Hebrew name) on a sheet of paper with a pen or pencil (I prefer pencil because you can erase and correct mistakes).  Then draw a circle around the sigil, then draw a circle around that circle.  In between the circles, write the name of the Archangel in English (or your native language) in four areas.  Between the names you can draw little crosses, pentagrams, or stars of David if you just want to spice up your Sigils design.

3\. Find a private place where you won't be distracted by outside influences.  If you have an altar in your room, you can use some tape to tape the sigil on the wall above it.

4\. After you have found your space and set up the sigil so that you can see it and focus on it, cleanse your space so that you only get the spirit you want.  The cleansing can be done by multiple means such as through prayers, spells, and rituals.  Some resources you can use for this from this Coven page are: St. Michael's Prayer, Hallowing Spell, Flames of Purgatory, and others.  But feel free to cleanse however you want, just please cleanse your space so demons don't infiltrate your ritual!

5\. Once your space has been cleansed, light the votive candle (I would suggest holding it so that you don't accidentally knock it over and burn things).  Then focus on the sigil in front of you and chant the name of the Archangel in any language you want (preferably the one you are best at speaking).  Keep doing this until you feel the presence of the Archangel coming into your space.  Once that has been done, feel free to talk to the Archangel through prayer.  You can ask it for many things: you can ask it to become your spirit guide, you can ask it for favors, you can ask it for good fortune, you can ask it for information about the Spirit world or more mundane knowledge, etc.

Final Note:  You can also use this ritual to just connect with your Archangel or attract their favor to you without actually summoning the Angel.
