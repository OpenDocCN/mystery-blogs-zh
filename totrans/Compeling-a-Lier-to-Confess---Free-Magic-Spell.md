I performed this spell three or four nights ago. However I didn't do it for seven consecutive nights. Because I felt within myself I believed the spell manifested alot quicker with quicker results. I did address the candle with liquorice oil which aids in commanding the perpetrator to reveal the lies they have been hiding. Blessed Be everybody.

There a few other colours the candle could be. Purple would not be my first choice, but it would work. I would also carve a sigil/symbol into the candle that represents truth, justice, or honesty. Otherwise, this appears to be a working spell.
