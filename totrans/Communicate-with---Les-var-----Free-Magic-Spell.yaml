    Les'var. Being claims to be older than creation. Doesn't always respond.

- en: As a foreword this spell is unlike most magic. It doesn't act as a true summoning
    would. Instead it seems to be more of an invitation to the being Les'var to communicate
    with you. The being can communicate in a plethora of methods. So keep your eyes
    and mind open...
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To begin you will need to remove any protective rites, spells, tokens, etc...
    These seem to interfere with the communication process of Les'var. No protective
    wards or spells may be in place at the time of casting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To begin you will need a small bit of your blood as an offering. A few drops
    will suffice. The blood must be fresh though. Not stored for any period of time...
    Simply allow the blood to fall to the ground or floor then commence.

- en: Do not attempt to any sort of protective rite or spell afterward or it will
    interrupt the communication. Avoid any form of protective charm or token as well.
    Certain natural obstructions such as iron barriers or wild roses may interfere
    as well. Avoid if possible
