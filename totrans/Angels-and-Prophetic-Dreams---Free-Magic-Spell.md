This site helps a lot I use spells off here before and got a lot guide that come to me

Which spells would you recommend the most for a begginer? Ive always been very intuitive and can dream about things that havent happened yet. Im trying to exploymore into my abilities and am seeking more guidance from anyone willing to help with questions and advice. Its hard to find more people out there like me

there really isn't any ''beginner'' spells. once you know ''the basics'' of magick [meditation, energy work, visualization] you can cast any working spell. you're looking for spells with few ingredients or simply a chant, but all spells are cast the same way, regardless of intention or amount of items. look into simple candle spells [take a candle, charge with energy, light it, visualize outcome] or a chant [charge energy, visualize outcome, say chant] these are rather simple with few steps.
