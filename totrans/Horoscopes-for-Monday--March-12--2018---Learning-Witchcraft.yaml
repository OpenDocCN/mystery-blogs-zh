- en: The message of your birthday chart is that you need to get serious about your
    resources, both financial and emotional. You may want to help everyone you possibly
    can but that will spread you far too thin. Focus on those who need you the most.

- en: Think twice before taking up an offer of financial assistance today. There will,
    of course, be strings attached and the planets warn they may be the kind of strings
    that tie you down to restrictive commitments. Find other ways to make ends meet.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may be full of enthusiasm for the week ahead but you are strongly advised
    to be sensible and limit your plans to a short list of things you know can be
    accomplished. The planets warn that the more you take on the less you will actually
    do.

- en: Try not to dwell on your mistakes this week. Everyone makes errors – they are
    a part of life – but it’s what you learn from those errors that counts in the
    long-term. Despite recent setbacks you are still doing okay – in fact you are
    doing amazingly well.

- en: You are open to new ideas at the moment but later in the week you may go right
    the other way and refuse to see any point of view but your own. Try to remember
    that what matters to you may not matter one little bit to other people.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of your aims and ambitions will need to be adjusted over the next few days
    and the sooner you make whatever changes are needed the less disruption you will
    have to endure. Gemini is known as a flexible sign, so bend with the breeze.

- en: The Sun in Pisces endows you with huge self-assurance but other aspects warn
    you must be careful not to go too far and start believing that it is impossible
    for you to make a mistake – unless you want “events” to bring you down to earth
    again.

- en: Something you thought you had under control will start getting away from you
    today and, like it or not, you will have to get help from people who have more
    experience. It’s not a humiliation, it’s just a recognition that you are human
    like everyone else.

- en: No matter how much you think you know a friend or family member what they say
    or do today is sure to surprise you. One-to-one relationships need to be handled
    tactfully at this time of year, so resist the urge to criticize their choices.

- en: The demands of colleagues and employers may be getting a bit much for you. If
    that’s the case then you need to be brave and let them know that enough is enough.
    You’re not some kind of machine they can just switch on and off at will.

- en: Focus on creative activities over the next few days. Decide what it is you most
    want to build then put your heart and soul into it. And don’t listen to those
    who say you expect too much of yourself – the truth is you can never expect too
    much.

- en: You may not be the life and soul of the party at the moment but that’s okay.
    Sagittarius is a sign that likes to think deeply about life and with so much on
    your mind now there is little time for partying. You’ll make up for it later!

    to see sense today. Yes, the evidence clearly points to a certain conclusion but
    if they don’t want to see it you have no right to force them. Let them learn the
    hard way.
