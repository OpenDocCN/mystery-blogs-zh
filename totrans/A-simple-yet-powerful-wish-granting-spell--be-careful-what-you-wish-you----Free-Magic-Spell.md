 **A simple yet powerful wish granting spell (be careful what you wish you)**

I'm sure everyone has heard the phrase and rhyme known as ''if your heart is in your dream no request is too extreme''. So you can use this spell to wish for whatever you feel in you want to wish for in your heart, meaning something you really want. So you could wish for anything, but you must believe and have faith in the process of spells. So don't go wishing for something you know will never come true ( I'm pretty sure you know what I mean) (Spell added on: 3/24/17 at 10:17pm)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'A simple yet powerful wish granting spell (be careful what you wish you)'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Whatever you think will help you to focus on your wish or whatever will help you to direct your energy towards your wish. If your wishing for love than hold a rose quartz crystal for example. But ingredients in spells are just there to either help you focus or to help you to direct appropriate energy towards your spell.

Chant to raise power ''Wind, Earth, Fire, Water, I call to you to make this spell magic so mote it be''

Now think of your wish, to be short and simple and to the point; the more detail and the more specific you can be, the better the wish will come out when it has been manifested onto the physical plane from the spiritual plane.

Chant anywhere from three to ten times
''By sun and moon and stars above, with positive intentions and the energy of love, like summerland my wish shall shine, let my will be done and this wish be mine, as I do will so mote it be''

Now bind your spell by saying ''For the good of all and to harm none, this spell is bound and is to not be undone, by the power of three times three, as I do will, so mote it be''

Give thanks to the divine and the higher powers as well as the elements f aiding in your spell! And don't forget to say farewell!

Why doesnt this ever work for me :/ literally tried it so many times

What are you wishing for? This spell could be flawed, you could be wishing for something not possible, or you might not be in the right place to receive it [you want a lover but don't love yourself for example] it could also be you need to wait longer for the spell. If you're wishing to become an architect but you haven't even gone to university for it, it would be a longer path for you than if you're wishing for a raise at work. If it's a longer goal the spell would work by giving you more opportunities to achieve that goal. Finally, I suggest making a vision board and using some of the law of attraction to help manifest your wish [again, provided its plausible. Anything that contradicts nature won't happen] good luck

Would it work if I wished for a new iPhone?

Yes, but don't expect one to appear before you. You might be gifted a used iPhone [new to you] or you could get one as a holiday gift, win a contest, or find ways to save up to buy your own.

It didn't work.

Consider that while the universe answers all prayers... Sometimes that answer is 'no.'

Just because a person does not get what they want, it doesn't necessarily mean they have been un-heard, or that there has not been an answer.

what if i wished for me and my girl to sit down and talk?

I have a really strong bond with the neighbours horse, could I wish to own him?

This would count as harmful to other people because that is their horse. They paid for it. Although you have somewhat good intentions, that would be harmful to tyour neighbours.

You can. Regarding the ''harm'' point, only certain paths believe in ''harm none'' so it's not a universal law. You could cast a wish spell and the horse is gifted or sold to you at a price you can afford. I would suggest thinking before casting any spell. Think about ways it could harm another and if you're okay with that. Casting a job spells means taking the opportunity from someone else. But when you've been out of work for a long time, or are in a job you despise, it might be worth it. If you don't believe in harm to none, don't worry, but it's wise to at least look at the big picture just in case something unforeseen appears and you regret the spell you cast.

Is it possible to wish for time travel?

you could, though the odds aren't in your favour. you could invent a way to time travel, but more likely you'll become proficient in past life regression [or the universe has a sick sense of humour and you discover old home movies] if you're hoping to physically travel through time it won't work.

Nekoshema...yeah. Honestly, some of the deities I've worked with do have a sick sense of humor (Zeus conjured up a sand-storm when I asked for a storm...thanks Zeus). So it wouldn't be that far-fetched for the universe to do the same.

Im wishing for my brothers safety I hope this works

if i wish for someone to ask me out. when will the wish be fulfilled

It's next to impossible to put a time frame on a spell since there are a plethora of factors you need to consider. If someone already likes you, fairly quickly [say within the first few days of the wish] if you live in a tower in the middle of nowhere and your only contact is your caregiver, then this spell might take a little longer.

what are types of wishes that are not able to come true cause it's impossible?

That's a pretty hefty list. The short answer is anything that isn't possible, like bringing back an extinct species, floating into the air, teleporting, time travel. In theory, you could wish for technology to make these things possible, but the chances of that coming true are ridiculously low. Wish spells are good for things in the realm of possibility but you can't find a specific spell.

So, could I use this to obtain the job I want most? I am qualified for it, yet I never get hired, or even get an interview. It is a very well paying job, but I keep having to settle for low paying jobs that barely pay bills, and leave me with nothing at the end of the month. Could this wish spell make it more likely to get a certain job I've applied to?

What if we don't have anything, like the rose quartz? And what if we can't remember all of the words? Can we write them on paper or read of of our devices?

If you are missing a component/symbol that is called for in the working, there may be an alternative or substitute you could use instead. The items are there to be symbols. They represent your situation and goals or specific qualities you want to be reminded of and to draw inward. If you are missing something that you feel you need, research why it is there in the first place. What meaning does it have? What does it represent or symbolise. Then, go looking around for other things that have a similar meaning or representation. Who knows, you might even come across something that better encapsulates what you want to represent.

As for handling the words of a spell, it isn't uncommon to read them out. However it tends to be a little less efficient for some. Ideally, if you haven't memorized the words, then continue to read and recite them until you can do it by heart. Consider it a part of the effort you are committing towards the spell-the more you put into it, the more you get out. All it takes to memorize the spell is some practice and repetition. (And patience)
