- en: Iada has always existed and always will. She is all powerful and of both genders
    as well as all present and all knowing. Even others like her never come close
    to her standard of being considered a god by her standard. The standard being
    that you must be able to raise the dead using your own power, without invoking
    another's power, exactly as they were, the age the were upon the moment of their
    death, and with their memories completely and totally intact. By Iada's standards,
    if you can't do this, you are not a god.

- en: at any rate I am now going to tell you the traits all Iadians have that makes
    them what they and myself are. I minding you every one of us are different as
    we're individuals. Although with those like me who were converted, apart from
    the physical traits, most or our abilities become latent, but this can be solved
    by doing a spell or ritual to unlock your latent abilities. other paths to unlocking
    these are waiting for ten years, or running ten miles a day six days a week for
    a year.

    into matter. but this is dependent upon what you already know how to create, plus
    how powerful you are. Yes, You'll have to do your homework studying blueprints,
    chemical compositions, all sorts of things to get good at this.

    with lots of exercise, an Iadian becomes 150% physically stronger than a vampire
    (a vampire 20 times stronger than a human male). but this is also a double edged
    sword. I actually have to take care not to damage my muscles as I use them. Iada
    told me that I must regenerate my muscles after each day of training to repair
    them.

- en: 4\. Bodies infused with holy energy and the ability to draw and use holy energy
    to physically enhance ourselves and regenerate. This also makes every part of
    us ten times more toxic to unholy creatures than silver. We can also recover from
    illness faster somewhere between 10-20 times faster than humans. And from my experience,
    drawing holy energy works about 5 times better than coffee in the morning.

- en: 7\. All Iadians are creatures of both genders--just like Iada. Although there
    are variations in the range between both genders. This is common for all Iadians.
    Some of us look just like men or woman, while most have an overall female appearance.
    But since we are of both genders, our psychology is a fusion of male and female,
    and as such we can think in the same matter is either gender as well as think
    in a gender neutral way. It is what makes us Iadians ideally suited for use in
    leadership roles.
