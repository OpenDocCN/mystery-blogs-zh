- en: By all means be open about your aims and ambitions over the coming year but
    don’t give away so much information that you dilute the impact of what you are
    doing. What you know is important, of course, but what your rivals don’t know
    matters too.

    but fear not because it will get easier. However, for the moment you would be
    wise to weigh each and every word before opening your mouth to speak. Or just
    stay quiet!

- en: The logical, reasoning side of your mind needs to be encouraged and cultivated.
    Yes, you tend to do best when acting on what your inner voice tells you but sometimes
    the messages can get a bit garbled. Always, but always, be aware of the facts.

- en: You are hugely assertive and ambitious at the moment, and that’s good. But don’t
    come on too strong and annoy people whose assistance you may need in the future.
    The world may be yours for the taking but it’s still good manners to ask.

- en: You will be doing a lot of thinking over the next few days and some of the conclusions
    you reach may be a bit scary. The simple fact is you don’t just need to change
    the way you live, you need to transform it – not later, but now!

- en: You may think you need to give up on something you once had high hopes for but
    don’t be hasty. As Mercury, planet of the mind, is going through one of its retrograde
    phases you may not be thinking straight. Ponder it a little longer.

    have been content to play minor or supporting roles for far too long. The fact
    is you have more talent than most if not all of your colleagues and competitors
    – so use it!

    Once you have done that you won’t be quite so judgmental about what they say and
    do. Everyone is to some extent a product of their own past. Yes, even you.

    that fact over and over again. Today’s Sun-Mercury link warns if you let your
    doubts get the better of you then success will continue to elude you. Don’t let
    that happen.

    independence and go your own way? At some stage you are going to have to decide
    one way or the other but don’t decide just yet. It needs considerably more thought.

    mentally and emotionally. So give yourself a bit of breathing space and don’t
    take on any new tasks until you have got your second wind. Even then, be choosy.

    you may be right, but that is not an excuse, still less an invitation, to throw
    caution to the wind. Even a Sagittarius needs guidelines to live by. So what are
    yours?

    because the planets warn you are going to need them. You don’t have to pretend
    that you like certain people but you still have to work with them, so keep talking.
