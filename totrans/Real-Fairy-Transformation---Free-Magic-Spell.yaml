- en: I have explained on other spells and forums. Physical transformation is not
    possible as a result of the natural limitations of Real Magic. On the physical
    plane it is ruled by nature and cannot contradict nature, ergo this spell is fake.
    You can work with The Fae, but you cannot become one.

    you can yell at me since most people do, Mermaid47\. This is simply a natural
    law like gravity or the Earths rotation. On the physical plane, Magic does not
    defy nature. Fae are spirits of nature, you can work with them, I know this for
    a fact because I have worked with them for a long time. You cannot physically
    transform into one because humans cannot naturally change into other creatures,
    it is not in our nature, ergo, it contradicts nature, ergo, Magic will not make
    it so. See for yourself if you still do not accept my words as facts, but I assure
    you Magic does not contradict nature.

    our species with magick, that simply isn't how it works, no matter how much belief
    you have.

- en: why are they so many fakes spells around here?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because only the site admin can delete spells and he has more important things
    to do like keep the site running. A lot of these are old spells and were uploaded
    by people who didn't know the difference between real and fake spells. Since a
    lot of people come to this site to marvel at the fake spells, we get ad revenue
    and the site remains free for the members. [Lesser of two evils I guess] This
    is probably why the admin made the spells comment section so people could help
    each other learn [though they've become more of a shouting match] If you're interested
    in working with faeries, I would do a little research first since they can be
    tricky creatures, but there are a handful of working spells calling on the fae
    [though, you might have an easier time simply asking in the site forums for faerie
    spells instead of clicking on 90 fake spells to find 10 real ones] Best of luck
    to you.
