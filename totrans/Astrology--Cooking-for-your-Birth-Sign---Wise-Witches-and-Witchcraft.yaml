    the stars tell you that might help make that meal more memorable? Here is a list
    of Zodiac birth signs and ideas about their culinary palates.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aries is all about fire. Anything spicy tickles their tongue. Bear in mind that
    your always-moving Aries really does like to eat-and-run. Make finger foods for
    the road. This seems rather contrary to their HUGE appetite, but there you have
    it. Aries rarely worry about diets (we are so jealous). They enjoy rich food and
    would probably revel at the idea of making something new together.

- en: In the world of consumption your Taurus is an inspired foodie. Like Aries they
    enjoy a hardy meal but won’t rush all that lusciousness. Taurus eats with his
    eyes. Make sure your meal looks as good as it tastes, and don’t forget candles
    and centerpieces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Give your Taurus pasta, sweet treats and fresh bread slathered in butter. Whatever
    you do, don’t say the word “diet” in their presence. The thought alone torments.
    Ask your Taurus partner for some of her favorite recipes that you can try for
    her next visit.

- en: Gemini guests lean toward cooking more than eating. They want good conversation,
    which of course gets interrupted with each bite. However, get your Gemini into
    a kitchen and watch the wonders created. Fusion cooking is definitely in the Gemini’s
    wheel house. No matter what he makes – you are going to love it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important thing when cooking for a Gemini is remembering that variety
    is the spice of life. This is not the gal who wants the same thing three nights
    in a row, and she has no idea what an “eating schedule” looks like.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you talk to your Cancer about food the first thing she’ll do is show you
    her grandmother’s recipes lovingly held in a well-read book. Cancer loves food
    traditions and want to share them. In return, serve up some of your family’s favorites
    complete with the accompanying story.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you know your Cancer is nervous or anxious, keep the meal light and healthy.
    Otherwise food becomes a coping mechanism. They will keep eating until they cannot
    move.

- en: Feeding a lion is an expensive proposition. There is no skimping for this kitty
    cat. That gourmet steak and fancy side dish cost a bundle. Nothing but the best
    for your lion. Truth be told, they’re happier at a fancy restaurant than eating
    at home.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If that’s not possible, Leo enjoys company when dining. Family get-togethers
    are the best! Fill your meal time with laughter.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where Aries was spicy, Virgo is rather the “plain Jane”. People born under this
    sign have touchy tummies. When getting together with a Virgo consider letting
    them cook. Watching them work in the kitchen is nothing short of astonishing.
    Because Virgo craves perfection, every portion of the meal looks like it drifted
    from the pages of a culinary magazine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When feeding your Virgo seek out recipes with the wow factor in flavor. Make
    the meal, and yourself, wholly irresistible. Never toss away leftovers in the
    presence of a Virgo. This is a huge food faux pas. Give those portions to your
    Virgo in a doggy back. They’ll make something of it later.

    sign sees food like an elaborate play. Everything has its place and time. Get
    your book out on how to set a table again (they will notice).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Give your Libra flavorful morsels from a well-planed menu. Go from appetizer
    to dessert and an after-dinner drink in that order. Once you’re done putting things
    in the kitchen, Libra wants to sit and simply enjoy the moment.

- en: Scorpios always seem hungry but aren’t prone to over eating. Make sure to have
    plenty of “munchies” on hand for in-between meals. In terms of spices – the more,
    the better. Don’t go shopping for herbs with your Scorpio – you will never come
    home.
  prefs: []

- en: Before making a meal for your Scorpio gently inquire as to their preferences.
    This birth sign does not pad corners. A little research avoids a scathing review.

- en: Sagittarians are the people with whom you want to travel the world, testing
    every type of exotic fare. Movable meals please Sagittarius. They do have odd
    swings in their eating habits, though. One day they want nothing to do with food
    and the next they’re eating everything in sight. A lot of this behavior has ties
    to the Sagittarians zealous approach to life. When they get caught up, they forget
    to eat. When they eat, they want to be excited about it. Keep it interesting!

    have to cook a lot to keep your Capricorn happy. Make even one scrumptious dish,
    and he’ll be over the moon.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t get to fanciful with the ambiance of your meal. Casual is “in”. Do what
    you can in creating a stress-free zone. DO make something traditional. There’s
    a ritual to eating for the Capricorn and you will see it as you go.

- en: Aquarians are the thinkers of the Zodiac. When they’re caught up in musing,
    a salad or yummy vegetables fit the bill quite nicely. In fact, your Aquarian
    may be a Vegetarian or Vegan – it’s in their makeup.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being ever the non-conformist, Aquarians appreciate any attempt at creative
    or imaginative meals. Telling them how you came up with that idea makes it even
    better. They love all things fruity while avoiding caffeinated beverages.

    are absolutely passionate about food. Cooking for them shows appreciation and
    thoughtfulness. It’s a true language of love.
  prefs: []

    candles and you’re ready to eat. This guy or gal also relishes foods made with
    alcohol. A good wine reduction sauce send them to heaven.
