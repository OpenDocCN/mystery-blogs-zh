    your always-moving Aries really does like to eat-and-run. Make finger foods for
    the road. This seems rather contrary to their HUGE appetite, but there you have
    it. Aries rarely worry about diets (we are so jealous). They enjoy rich food and
    would probably revel at the idea of making something new together.

    enjoy a hardy meal but won’t rush all that lusciousness. Taurus eats with his

    and centerpieces.

    her next visit.

    which of course gets interrupted with each bite. However, get your Gemini into
    a kitchen and watch the wonders created. Fusion cooking is definitely in the Gemini’s
    wheel house. No matter what he makes – you are going to love it.

    sign have touchy tummies. When getting together with a Virgo consider letting
    them cook. Watching them work in the kitchen is nothing short of astonishing.
    Because Virgo craves perfection, every portion of the meal looks like it drifted
    from the pages of a culinary magazine.

- en: When feeding your Virgo seek out recipes with the wow factor in flavor. Make
    the meal, and yourself, wholly irresistible. Never toss away leftovers in the
    presence of a Virgo. This is a huge food faux pas. Give those portions to your
    Virgo in a doggy back. They’ll make something of it later.

    every type of exotic fare. Movable meals please Sagittarius. They do have odd
    swings in their eating habits, though. One day they want nothing to do with food
    and the next they’re eating everything in sight. A lot of this behavior has ties
    to the Sagittarians zealous approach to life. When they get caught up, they forget
    to eat. When they eat, they want to be excited about it. Keep it interesting!

  zh: 射手座是你想要一起环游世界，品尝各种异国美食的人。可移动的餐点能让射手座满意。不过他们的饮食习惯会有奇怪的起伏。一天他们对食物毫无兴趣，而第二天又能吃上一切。这种行为大部分源于射手座对生活的狂热态度。当他们沉迷时，会忘记进食。而他们一旦开始吃，就希望有所激动。让他们觉得有趣吧！
