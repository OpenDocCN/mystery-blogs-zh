    a heart on your palm with a marker, your mind, or your finger. Keep drawing the
    heart as you repeat the spell. You can imagine how it would feel to have a partner.
    The hugs they will give you, kisses, etc. You can also think about what type of
    person (personality, religion, etc.) you want to attract.

    gender specific. You focus on your ideal partner when casting. Seems plausible,
    just needs an edit, and you should create you own sigil since sigils are personal.
