- en: In mythology, She is usually depicted as a beautiful woman with a crown on her
    head. Hera was worshiped mostly by women due to Her connection with them. Many
    women prayed to Hera with hopes of finding love and lasting marriage. Women would
    also pray to Hera for help falling pregnant and protection during childbirth,
    as she is closely connected with family and children. She may have also been one
    of the first Greek deities to have a dedicated enclosed-roof temple sanctuary
    at Samos around 800 BCE.

- en: 'In general, Hera was worshipped in two main capacities: (1) as consort of Zeus
    and queen of heaven and (2) as goddess of marriage and of the life of women. The
    second sphere naturally made her the protectress of women in childbirth, and she
    bore the title of Eileithyia, the birth goddess, at √Årgos and Athens. At √Årgos
    and S√°mos, however, Hera was even more than queen of heaven and marriage goddess.
    She was patron of those cities, which gave her a position corresponding to that
    of Athena at Athens. (Encyclopedia Britannica)'

    to work with or worship Hera, I strongly urge you to learn all you can about Her.
    She is not a Goddess to deceive, and She does not take well to infidelity or lies.
    We can see that simply by the way She behaves with Zeus and His infidelities.
    If you are more interested in Her worship in a historical context or in the context
    of reconstructionist/revivalist Hellenismos, it is doubly-important to understand
    these things about Her, but to also understand the context of Her myths and stories.
