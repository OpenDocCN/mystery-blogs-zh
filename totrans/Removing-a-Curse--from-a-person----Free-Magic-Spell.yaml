    corner of their profile. As for your current predicament, what spell exactly was
    used? Blood Magik is not inherently evil, so saying ''blood curse'' would mean
    the caster used some of your blood, or you cast a curse using your own blood.
    Blood personalizes the spell to the person, so unless your blood was used, this
    would not be the result of the spell/curse. The majority of curses in my experience
    are the result of your own fear charging your person with negative energy thus
    resulting in cursing yourself. Similar to worrying yourself sick. All of this
    is a round about way of saying, unless we know the exact spell, we can only give
    generic options to remove it. Cleanse yourself and your home, then ward and protect
    yourself and your home. There are a plethora of ways to do this, but I do not
    wish to take up too much space in the comment section. Once you cleanse and protect,
    the most important thing is to raise your vibration. If you stay in a scared low
    vibration, the negative energy will return and continue to plague you. You need
    to create a daily routine to bring positive energy in. A daily blessing, an affirmation,
    meditation, shielding. Focus on things that bring you joy, this will charge positive
    energy and help prevent negative energy from returning. You may need to cleanse
    and protect more frequently at first.
