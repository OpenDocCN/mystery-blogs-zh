    worry, we’re here to help. In this article, I’ll share 10 steps that will point
    you in the right direction if you’d like to learn about spirituality for beginners.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spirituality is a personal journey that can be different for each person. It
    can encompass a variety of things, from religious beliefs to yoga and meditation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For some, spirituality is a way of life. It provides a sense of peace and purpose
    and helps them connect with something larger than themselves.

    started.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step in finding your spirituality is to determine what you believe
    in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be a difficult task, as there are so many different options to choose
    from. Some people believe in a single god or divine force, while others believe
    in many gods or spiritual beings. Some people practice meditation or prayer, while
    others focus on self-care and living in the moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    feel connected to something larger than yourself. Whatever it is, make sure that
    it feels authentic to you and that you can commit to it long-term.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the key differences between spirituality and religion. A religion
    dictates what you must believe. But everyone already has their own beliefs. These
    can’t be willed or changed haphazardly. You believe what you believe, and there
    is a form of spirituality out there that is your own personal form allowing all
    those beliefs.

  prefs: []

    practice their faith? Were you raised in a religious tradition, or were you more
    of a spiritual seeker?

    that might resonate with you.
  prefs: []

    I got to high school. But there was a spiritual necessity left behind. I researched
    and tried practicing almost everything you can imagine before coming into Wicca
    as a path.
  prefs: []

    of the feminine, ritual without dogma, a connection with the divine, and upholding
    ancient traditions.'

    were and what others can offer is an important stepping stone.

    answers. Write about experiences and how they made you feel. Write about what
    you feel you are lacking and your goals.
  prefs: []

    be afraid to explore new ideas and concepts; after all, that’s what spirituality
    is all about!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that you’ve got a framework, it’s time to start exploring different spiritual
    practices. This can be done in a variety of ways, but one of the best ways to
    learn is to read about different practices and then try them out.

    extremely important to understand spirituality broadly before committing to one
    specialized form of it. I continue to read books every year that contribute to
    my spiritual growth.
  prefs: []

    healing, there’s a book for that. And once you’ve read about a practice, don’t
    be afraid to try it out. You may not be good at it right away, but that’s okay!

    beliefs.

    subjects to bring up in polite company in most cultures.

    to online forums or social media groups. Follow spiritual people you admire on
    Twitter or Facebook. Ask questions on meditation or yoga or Wicca forums.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    someone willing to help when you ask from a place of genuine interest. Spirituality
    for beginners can be daunting and most people remember this.
