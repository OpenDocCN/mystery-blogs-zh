- en: Affirmations only became popular over the last few years, but they’re now hugely
    celebrated for one simple reason: *they work.* Healing affirmations are especially
    powerful because they can help to overcome many different afflictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These affirmations for healing can apply in so many different cases. Whether
    you have a physical or mental illness, or you’re simply going through a difficult
    emotional time, these healing affirmations can quite literally change your reality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea behind affirmations is that our thoughts (and words) create our corporeal
    world, so after enough repetition, we will start to believe the affirmation which
    will then change our body chemistry. This is great if you believe in energy work,
    but for all you science people out there, [the data stands behind affirmations](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/)
    as well.

    for a week or so and you’ll soon find that it feels *natural and good.*

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are so many different ways that you can use healing affirmations. Some
    ideas include printing (or writing) out the affirmation and hanging it in your
    home, setting it as your iPhone background, sleeping with the affirmation under
    your pillow, or even just repeating the affirmation a specific amount of times
    each day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can say the affirmation or look at it, but for the best effect, I recommend
    that you do both. The more you experience the words behind the affirmation, the
    more powerful the results will be.
