*   Paper

*   Pen

 At night take the paper write your wish. Light the candle. Say: "I wish I will have (whatever). Oh please (name of deity) grant me my wish so let it be".

Then burn the paper with the wish in the candle. The wish has to be the same type of color the candle symbolizes. There is a few articles on candle colors and what the represent. They do not always represent what you think they would. The reason you don't need to say the wish in the spell, is because it's on the paper. The paper is what the wish goes to the god or goddess.
