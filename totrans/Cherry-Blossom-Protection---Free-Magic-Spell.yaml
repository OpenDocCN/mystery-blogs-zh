    them until you see them in your minds eye. Draw them around you, you can use your
    arms physically if you wish, but draw them around you;completely surrounded yourself
    with them. (just like forming a bubble) This is like forming an astral Shield
    around you with your own aura and it is a very useful form of protection.
