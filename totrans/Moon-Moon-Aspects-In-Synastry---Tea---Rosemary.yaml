- en: However, as nurturing and comforting as this aspect is, it’s important to be
    mindful of maintaining individual emotional identities. In such a deeply connected
    emotional landscape, it can be easy to become too enmeshed, losing sight of where

    and activities outside of the relationship. Encouraging each other to pursue individual
    goals and passions not only strengthens personal emotional health but also brings
