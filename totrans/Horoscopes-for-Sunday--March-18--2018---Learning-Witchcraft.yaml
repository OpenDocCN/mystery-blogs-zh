    when dealing with people in positions of power. They’re really not that different
    to you – in fact in some important ways you can claim to be better.

    will bring back a smile to your face. Over the next 48 hours though you may need
    to tie up a few financial loose ends. Start the new phase free of money worries.

    so-called problems and issues are not worth worrying about. The world is what
    you choose to make of it Pisces, so choose to love and learn. Laughing helps too.

    in your birth sign on Tuesday. There were one or two moments in recent weeks when
    you almost gave up but you stayed the course and pretty soon you’ll be top dog
    again.

    be deceptive and beneath that calm exterior you are plotting and planning and
    waiting for the right moment to make your move. That moment will come very soon,
    so be ready.

    you may have failed in the past you are sure to succeed in major ways over the
    next few weeks. Something else worth noting about your sign is that you never
    give up.

    Sun moves into your fellow Fire sign of Aries on Tuesday. Between now and then
    start making plans. Make them big. Make them huge. Make them humungous.

    to put your own needs first. That applies as much to your emotions as it does
    to your cash. There is only so much you have to give and your reserves are running
    low.

    Come Tuesday, when the Sun moves into your opposite sign, there will be other
    matters – relationships in particular – that demand your time and attention, so
    get busy.

    that as a sign that you are doing too much and pushing yourself too hard. If you
    don’t slow down willingly now events may slow you down unwillingly later on.

    and believe you can do anything you please – you may get a painful reminder that
    you cannot.

    a brave face as always but if you need a shoulder to cry on (in private) you know
    who to go to.
