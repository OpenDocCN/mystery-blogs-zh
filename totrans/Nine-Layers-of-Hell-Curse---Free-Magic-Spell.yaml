- en: This ritual is made to curse and torture a person by the agonies brought on
    by nine arch-demons. This ritual will allow one to journey into Hell and throw
    a mortal soul before nine arch-demons and destroy the victim nine times in Hell.
    This ritual is most likely fatal to the mortal body of the victim. This ritual
    can invite demons into your home if it is used too much. This spell has one catch,
    it kills the weakest people in the house of your target first, so repeated use
    is necessary. This ritual circumvents the judgment of God upon a targeted soul
    should the victim die as a result.
