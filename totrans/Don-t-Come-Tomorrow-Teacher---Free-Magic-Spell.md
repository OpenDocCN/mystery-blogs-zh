hello! im a baby witch and this is one of my first few spells that im trying; does this work a 100%? and do i need any other special equipment to make sure the desired effects take place?

No spell is 100% guaranteed. For your first spell, this one might be tricky since it requires you to focus a lot of energy on the target [items used in spells have magickal energy and give power to the spell, so you would rely less on your own ability] Also, this chant seems rather vague. It doesn't specify who you're calling on, simply ''ancient ones'' which could be any God, demon, faerie, or entity good or bad, to stop your teacher from coming to school. Which, by not specifying, could be anything from a migraine, the car won't start, broken bone, all the way to death [death being a long shot since, again, first spell relying completely on your own ability, but it's still a possibility] You can try it, but I would specify like ''give my teacher a cold'' or ''ensure their car won't start.'' Personally, I would go with a different spell. I don't know why you don't want your teacher coming to school but perhaps work on that. If you have bad grades, a spell to help you study, if they don't like you, a truth spell, protection spell, or perhaps a binding.
