**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Your Imagination

*   A Quiet Place

*   One White Candle (Optional)

*   One Notebook

 To start, light the white candle and place it in front of you with the notebook. Open to a blank page and draw a door. (Get creative! Draw some plants, and some designs around!) Once you are finished and have a completed design you are happy with, close your eyes and relax. Imagine that you’re are walking through the door and on the other side is a beautiful valley filled with all of your favorite things (plants, animals, etc.). This is your happy place! You may enter it whenever you feel the need. Enjoy walking around in your valley, and when you are done, close your notebook.

Thank you for reading! I hope you have an amazing day!
God bless!~
