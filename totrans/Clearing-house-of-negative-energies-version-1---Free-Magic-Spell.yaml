- en: Sage sticks are really bundles of sage tied together to make a stick. There
    are multiple types of sage, but personally the least bad smelling type when burned
    is Desert Sage. But sage incense is good as well. Sage sticks are found in new
    age and occult shops, as well as herb shops too. The burning of sage to purify
    an area originated from the Native Americans.

    But the bowl is not needed if you are using incense, you just need an incense
    holder.

- en: So first, light the sage stick. Make sure plenty of smoke is coming up from
    it. Sometimes if it is difficult to light, it means there is A LOT of negative
    energy in the space. But when it smokes, carry the stick around the room, chanting
    ''Love and peace fill this space, negativity is out of this place'' go into closets
    too, then go to a window, open it to let the negative energies leave, close it,
    then trace a banishing pentagram above the window, while saying ''this window
    is sealed'' go to doors and other windows in the room, saying ''this window/door
    is sealed.'' repeat in each room in the house, do not skip a spot. When done,
    go outside and move the smoke around you saying ''only peace and love reside within
    me, all negative and evil now leaves'' add extra words if you want. Do the same
    for any family, friends or pets that are there. Then snuff the sage out. Get a
    container of salt, and put a circle of salt around your house. this is a shield
    for the home. As you do, chant ''protection I lay upon here'' or anything you
    feel better suits. When you are done, say ''In the name of the lord and lady,
    this house is protected, so mote it be!''
