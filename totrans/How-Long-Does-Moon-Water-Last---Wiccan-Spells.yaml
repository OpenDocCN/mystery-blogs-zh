- en: One of the primary challenges in collecting moon water is its limited availability.
    Although recent missions have confirmed the existence of ice deposits in certain
    regions of the moon, the distribution of water on its surface is uneven. Identifying
    and accessing these areas rich in water resources requires precise planning and
    advanced technology. Lunar missions need to target specific regions where the
    concentration of moon water is expected to be higher, such as permanently shadowed
    craters near the lunar poles.
