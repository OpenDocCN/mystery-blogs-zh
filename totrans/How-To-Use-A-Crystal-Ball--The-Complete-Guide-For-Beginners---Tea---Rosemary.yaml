- en: The crystal ball is one of the most well-known divination tools. If you visit
    any typical psychic, they probably have a crystal ball set up, even if it’s only
    for ambiance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Crystal balls are divination tools, although they’re often associated with pop
    culture witchcraft, especially in movies. They were first used by the Celtic Druids,
    but crystal balls quickly gained popularity and were even later found in the Roman
    Empire.
  prefs: []

- en: With the rise of Christianity, the crystal ball as a legitimate tool no longer
    existed. Instead, the crystal ball as we know it became a lighthearted symbol
    of a psychic or a witch. Crystal balls are so often seen in seedy psychic parlors
    that many witches at first believe they don’t work.

- en: Just like any other scrying tool, a crystal ball *can be* an effective divination
    tool. While it’s much easier to master crystal ball divination [if you’re clairvoyant](https://teaandrosemary.com/clairvoyant-clairvoyance-psychic-sight/),
    I find that almost anyone can get something insightful out of a scrying session
    using a crystal ball.

    energy and ground yourself.
  prefs: []

    or physically surrounding yourself in salt. For these types of divination activities,
    I typically use a shield of white light: I find that this works quite well.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you haven’t done this before, you’ll need to close your eyes and picture
    a strong circle of white light around you. Set the intention that only your higher
    self, your guides, or whoever you want to come through can penetrate the circle.

- en: You can scry (which means that you foretell the future through vision) using
    any shiny surface. Theoretically, you could use a shiny spoon. Crystal balls tend
    to be the most popular scrying tools, though.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is that? The shape of the crystal ball makes it easier to scry quicker and
    more effectively. You can certainly use other surfaces, but I recommend using
    a crystal ball if you aren’t well-versed in the art of scrying.

    there are various colors. Clear, white, black, and purple seem to be the most
    popular.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you. Sometimes, you can choose a color that coincides with what you want to learn
    in your crystal ball divination session.
  prefs: []

    be helpful. Amethyst crystal balls work well for health-related questions.

    oval or flat on the bottom). It’s also helpful to get a crystal ball that comes
    with a stand.

- en: Before using a crystal ball, you need to cleanse it so that you’re working with
    pure energy. You can either leave your crystal ball on the windowsill for a few
    hours (it can be cleansed by both the sunlight or the moonlight) or light a stick
    of incense and let the smoke waft around the crystal ball.

    that there is less reflections and glare that detracts from the crystal ball divination
    work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do know, however, that some witches prefer to scry in bright light. Some witches
    scry in complete darkness. You may need to try using your crystal ball in different
    light to figure out what works for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I recommend placing a dark cloth under or behind your crystal ball. You can
    either place your crystal ball on a stand or put it directly on the cloth. Make
    sure to nestle it so it doesn’t roll away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have chosen to scry in the darkness, then you’ll need *some* source of
    light. I typically light a small candle and place it about a foot behind my crystal
    ball. This gives me enough light to work with but doesn’t detract from the ambiance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sit comfortably in front of your crystal ball. When you’re ready to begin, close
    your eyes and breathe to center yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open your eyes and gaze at the surface of the crystal ball. You want to open
    your mind completely. Imagine that your mind is blank and let go of any thoughts
    that enter it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find it most effective to let my eyes slightly fuzz out as I focus. You will
    probably find that the more your eyes fuzz over, the sharper the images you’ll
    see in the crystal ball. I’m honestly not sure how this works scientifically,
    but it’s definitely real.
  prefs: []

    know what they mean, or the meanings of the pictures might be a mystery to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The one difficulty with scrying is trying to remember the images that you see
    after the session. I don’t like to break my concentration once I’m in the zone
    to write down messages, but I also tend to forget them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve found a happy middle ground where I stop every 5-10 minutes and write down
    as much as I can remember. If I’m quick about it, then it’s usually relatively
    easy to get back into trance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that when you first begin, you might not see anything at all. It
    can take a while to get deep enough into the trance, especially if you’re not
    super clairvoyant. Keep working on your trance and I promise, it’ll start to work!

    varied. It’s impossible to say exactly what you’ll see because it depends so much
    on the individual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or purpose. You definitely don’t have to do this, but I find that it helps to
    get more accurate visions.
  prefs: []

    the crystal ball, inside the crystal ball, or even off to the side. There really
    are no rules.

    it but didn’t get any messages. This is actually really common, especially if
    you have only tried using a crystal ball a few times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s not that the crystal ball malfunctioned or that your eyes didn’t work;
    the issue is that you couldn’t go deep enough into a trance to allow messages
    to come through. You simply weren’t at the right frequency to see the images on
    the crystal ball.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few fixes for this. Firstly, you can try doing a meditation before
    your crystal ball divination session to get into a deeper trance. Any good meditation
    should open up your energy field to allow you to see things more quickly. You
    can find great, simple meditations on YouTube.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you may just need to spend some more time getting into a trance.
    This means that you take more time to let your eyes fuzz over before you expect
    to see anything. Work on opening your mind to incoming messages.
