## How to start with Shadow Work?

Shadow work is a powerful practice to gain insight into our own internal struggles. It involves exploring the parts of us that we feel ashamed of, that we have pushed away and hidden from ourselves.

> To do shadow work, start by identifying what you are feeling – be it fear, anxiety, guilt, or shame – and take a few moments to sit with those feelings

Ask yourself why you feel this way, and if there is something you can learn from your emotions. Once you have identified the source of your feelings, take steps to address it. This can involve talking to a friend, journaling, or engaging in creative activities. Through this process, you can process and heal your shadows, ultimately leading to greater self-awareness and personal growth.

## How to use Journaling for Shadow Work?

Journaling is an effective tool for shadow work. It helps to identify and process any negative emotions, thoughts or beliefs we may have about ourselves that are holding us back. **To begin, start by writing down your feelings and thoughts in a stream of consciousness style.** This will help to identify any underlying patterns or beliefs that you may have. Once these have been identified, you can use your journal to explore these topics further and challenge any negative beliefs you have. Through regular journaling and reflection, you can **begin to transform these negative beliefs into positive ones**. It is also important to be compassionate and understanding as you go through this process. Shadow work can be difficult and challenging, so it is important to be gentle with yourself as you go through it.
