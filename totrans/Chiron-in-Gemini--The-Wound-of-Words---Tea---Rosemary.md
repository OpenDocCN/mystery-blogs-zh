Although every Chiron placement is important, Chiron in Gemini has the tendency to really affect an individual’s schooling, career, and social self-esteem. The need to discover and heal the wound can be extremely strong because of how impactful this wound is!

If you have Chiron in Gemini, look to the house to see where the wound will show itself and look at this article in terms of that house.

## The Chiron In Gemini Wound

The Chiron in Gemini wound comes from feeling unintelligent, stupid, or unable to properly communicate. This can manifest in a variety of ways, but always feels the same inside.

At their core, someone with Chiron in Gemini will feel *different* from others due to communication and intelligence.

This can be due to moving to a foreign country without speaking the language, a speech impediment, social anxiety, a lisp, a learning disability, not having education as a child, or the individual being told that he/she simply wasn’t intelligent. Sometimes, the person with Chiron in Gemini just can’t communicate the ideas in their head to others in a way that makes sense or sounds the same.

The Chiron in Gemini individual might also communicate in a way that’s not acceptable for the time period. For instance, they may think in emotions and pictures but be surrounded by those who think scientifically, or communicate through music instead of words.

## How This Wound Will Show Itself

The Chiron in Gemini person feels as though they’re ignorant, uneducated, or stupid, and this can show in a variety of ways.

The person show this in one of two ways. They might feel that others with more education, intelligence, and better communication skills are far above them and pedestalize those individuals. They will think that they don’t fit in due to trouble with words, but will always try to live up to how they see these people.

Alternatively, the Chiron in Gemini individual might feel bitter towards those who they perceive to be more intelligent and may gossip, slander, or put down others.

Often, someone with Chiron in Gemini will try to avoid any situation where they may have to attempt to be intellectual or to communicate, especially situations that require some sort of higher education or knowledge.

I find that Chiron in Gemini, more so than other Chironic wounds, can easily lead to depression, mental illness, or substance abuse. This is by no means an absolute (I would say I’ve found this to be true 65% of the time) and will depend on the house and aspect. If Chiron is placed for this to happen, I think it’s more common in Gemini because of the erratic, dual nature of the sign.

## Where Does the Wound Come From?

This wound is a bit more general because it can develop from a variety of outlets. The Chiron in Gemini person may have been actually told that they were stupid or unintelligent by parents, teachers, friends, or society as a child. Alternatively, the person was born with some sort of disability that made them feel unintelligent (a learning disability, social anxiety, a lisp, etc.) or they were thrown into a situation that caused them to believe this about themselves as they grew (e.g. moving to a foreign country as a child).

To discover more about this Chiron placement, look to the house that it’s in. Does this house give you any clues about how it manifests or where it comes from in your personal life and childhood?

## How to Heal Chiron in Gemini

If you have Chiron in Gemini, what you don’t realize is that you have a different kind of intelligence that is uniquely special. Society might not regard your intelligence or communication skills as important, but in the universe, your skills are needed; you have them for a reason.

Instead of doing what you think is good based on society’s rules, you need to learn how to speak your truth using your intuition. You might have mediumistic gifts or be psychically sensitive, or have some other method of communicating with alternatives forms of life like animals, plants, spirits, extraterrestrial beings, etc.

You might also communicate better through non-verbal means of communication such as art, music, or emotions. What you’ll want to do is find and acknowledge your unique gift and **use it.** You were given it for a reason! What type of advanced, different form of communication do you possess? Your job is to find and use it.

Often, those with Chiron in Gemini will go on to do many activities involving speech. Some of the most famous rappers in our time have Chiron in Gemini! It is only when someone accesses these special abilities (which must be done using intuition) that they will be able to achieve such goals.

## Famous People With Chiron in Gemini:
