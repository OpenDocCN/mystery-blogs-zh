    about any other person, then something bad gets happened to the thing or person,
    what he was jealous about, e.g : if you own the most expensive car in your city,
    and if anyone feels very jealous about you, then something can get wrong to the
    car or you. So, this is the belief, they name this impact as"najar", the power
    of jealousy.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Method 1:** Ask some other person to help. Then he/she must take some salt
    in his/her right hand, then he/she should move the hand around the person supposed,
    starting from the legs and a swing towards the head top. Again a swing back to
    the legs (this is now one round complete) and again to the top, Iike this one
    must make seven rounds around the person, then throw away the salt.'

- en: '**Method 2:  **Mostly peoples like to tie some blessed threads-strings, around
    the hands, legs, neck, or even the waist, mostly one of orange color blessed in
    a temple during the prayers by the Saint(s) there, else one with black color (may
    be blessed or not) also helps to get rid from "najar"!'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    perfect, simply don''t believe this, yes, just stay positive, and forget about
    such impacts.'
