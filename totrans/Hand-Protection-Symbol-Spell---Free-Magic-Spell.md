 ## Casting Instructions for 'Hand Protection Symbol Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

Nothing

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

Nothing

Hold the pen with your weak hand and start drawing the pentacle symbol on your
strong hand (on your palm). When you start drawing, say these words and
concentrate on the symbol you are drawing:

I draw the pentacle on my hand
To be protected
From harm from anyone and all negative energies
With the pentacle on my hand
I will be at full strength
And full power
So mote it be.

Make sure you finish drawing the pentacle before you day the words ''so mote it
be''. When the symbol fades away from your hand, so will the protection spell. So
don't use an ink pen that smudges easily and don't try to not get sweaty hands.
