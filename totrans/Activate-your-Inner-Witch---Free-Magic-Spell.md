So... this really works, right?

It depends on what you use it for, but it looks to me like you could use this as sort of a grounding or empowerment ritual before you cast other spells. It won't grant you any sort of ''magical powers'', but it can increase your focus and your touch with your faith, whether that be in nature or the energy around you. Whatever you look to when casting.

Right. This won't grant any ''magical powers'' but it can help you become closer to nature and it will help you use magick easier. I tried this a few years ago expecting to get supernatural abilities when that in fact will not work. All it did was empower me slightly, gave me a bit more focus in what I was doing, and helped me channel my own energy easier. While it may work in a realistic way, you cannot possibly hope to get supernatural abilities from it.

Does this work for 2 people?

This is not necessary to become a witch. If you want to be a witch, learn what magic is, what it can do, what it cannot do, and how it works.

Witches are merely humans who practice witchcraft, you do not need a spell to be a witch, simply study and practice the path. As for Demonica.w you are living in a fantasy world and do not understand what real witches and Pagans are like. I am a natural-born witch, my parents are Wiccan, and I was not only raised Wiccan, but I grew up around Pagans. While one can befriend angels and demons, your claims of having a ''human side'' leads me to conclude you are telling tall tales with the perception of sounding special. You are a witch, there is not a ''witch side'' you live this path completely. You are 100% witch, and 100% human at the same time.
