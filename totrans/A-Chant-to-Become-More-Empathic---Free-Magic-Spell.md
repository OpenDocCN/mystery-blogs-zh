**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Items/props are totally optional, otherwise none are required.

 1) Get into a meditative, trance-like state where you feel open and aware of the energy around you. This trance-like state is vital because this chant virtually absorbs in you the external energies of others, hence the purpose of the spell to be "more empathic"...

2) Once you feel aware and open, chant with a very clear voice:

***Goddess, mother of compassion,***

Help me now to understand

How others feel, so I can help them.

Guide me with your gentle hand.

Bring to me their true emotions,

Bring their dreams, their hopes, their fears.

Bring their hurts, that I may soothe them.

Bring their laughter and their tears.

Help me be more empathetic to the needs of others, please,

And help me nurture all around me.

As I will, so mote it be!
