- en: A binding spell is performed by grasping the negative energy that is propelling
    a person or object, and stopping it. If you desire justice, which often we do,
    then call upon Egyptian goddess Maat, she who balances the scales. This spell
    might be used if you feel you are being unfairly treated by a colleague or a family
    member.

    sacred space is as clear as you can make it. Contemplate your difficulty and acknowledge
    any part you may play in it.

    tie the first, say: "Negativity here be bound". As you tie the second: "Nastiness
    I do confound". As you tie the third: "By power of three, now you impound."'

- en: Put the ribbon and the feather together on your altar or sacred space. Leave
    it alone for three days for justice to be done. After this time take the ribbon
    and bury it, if possible in open ground.

- en: Keep the feather in your drawer or purse as a reminder of your willingness to
    be free. You must remember to control your own emotions of hatred or fear, for
    you must be above reproach. When you feel that the problem has dissipated, be
    tolerant and try to remain on good terms with the person concerned, but never
    tell them what you have done.
