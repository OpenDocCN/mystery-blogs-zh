    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [Aquamarine](https://wiccanow.com/aquamarine-crystal/). Today
    I thought we’d focus on another beautiful crystal, namely moldavite.

- en: '**Moldavite is a fascinating form of natural glass which was once thought to
    be of extraterrestrial origin. Today we know that moldavite is a form of tektite.
    Tektite is a natural glass formed when terrestrial stones are pulverised through
    the high-energy impact of a meteorite. Moldavite is named after the River Moldau
    where it was first found and is prized by mineral collectors. Its colour can range
    anywhere from bottle green to brownish green. It can be almost transparent or
    quite opaque. It has a shiny lustre and a rough surface texture.**'

    to help us to tap into cosmic energies. As such it is also a useful tool for meditation,
    astral work or divination.

    dizzy when they hold a piece of it in their hands. Make sure that your moldavite
    is [cleansed](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-cleanse-your-crystals-6-no-fuss-tips-and-tricks/)
    and [charged](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-charge-your-crystals-15-fantastic-tips/)
    before working with it in any rituals or spellwork.

    pass it over the selected tools. Hold it in your hands and walk through your sacred
    space making sure to pass the tektite (moldavite)across all window and door frames.

- en: To find insight into your own conditioned ways of thinking, hold a piece of
    moldavite while you meditate and allow it to guide your meditation. Sleep with
    it under your pillow to further assist your insights. (make sure you keep your
    [Book of Shadows](https://wiccanow.com/the-book-of-shadows-and-everything-you-need-to-know/)
    on your bedside table so that you can note any insights gained when you awaken).
    Some people are prone to suffering from nightmares if they sleep with moldavite
    underneath their pillow so take note of how you feel and remove it if you feel
    like it is negatively affecting your sleep.
