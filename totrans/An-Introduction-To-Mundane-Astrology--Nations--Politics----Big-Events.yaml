    of astrology governing places, countries, cities, entities, corporations, geographical
    events, and the world.

    we study something larger, something that’s more established.

    It’s quite literally the astrology of the world!
  prefs: []

    pull of the planets. It can be used to predict the future and prepare for possible

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you believe that Mundane astrology is true, then you could theoretically
    predict world events. Even if we can’t actually do anything to change these events
    (as this is usually impossible because the energy of the planets is *so* strong),
    you can still be prepared for what is coming.

    with your own chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For a nation or country, you simply need the birth date and place of the country.
    This is usually the “official” time and place that the country or nation came
    into existence. For the United States, we use the date, place, and time the Declaration
    of Independence was signed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    date as to when the nation truly began.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You do the same type of thing for a business, entity, town, city, or other place
    or thing. If you don’t have a specific birth time then you can either use your
    best guess, use 12pm (and omit references to the points and houses), or you can
    [use your pendulum](https://teaandrosemary.com/pendulum-dowsing-101/) to determine
    a birth time that both looks and feels correct.

    be overturned, that the world will explode because of climate issues, and that
    we will move to another planet. I mean seriously? Other countries have made it
    through their Pluto returns, but some haven’t. So at the end of the day, who knows?

    the history that we have researched.
  prefs: []

    beliefs influence what they see in a chart. Most of us do this sometimes (it’s
    really hard not to) but it’s also really important to look at the chart objectively.
  prefs: []

    is giving you a bunch of good news that goes against common sense and the current
    climate, don’t put too much stock into that.
  prefs: []
