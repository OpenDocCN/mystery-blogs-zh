- en: For many years, mistletoe, horse chestnuts and maples have helped to restore
    friendships after an argument. Ash trees have also been valuable; look for one
    that has a division right on top of the base. Ideally, you should be able to pass
    through it fairly easily.

    it in your hand, pass through the tree nine times in a counter clockwise direction.
    Say the following words.

    said the words above, move clockwise either around or through the tree, nine more
    times. Say these words.

    the knots, say the following words.

    about calling or writing the person that you have argued with. Is there any reason
    why you shouldn’t? Making peace is always the best answer.
