- en: There are few things I love as much as tarot. I got my first deck (a Universal
    Rider-Waite deck) almost twenty years ago. I dove right into learning the meanings
    and how to do different types of readings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    deck. It never really occurred to me that there *were* other decks.

    even thousands, of decks out there now. It can be daunting to choose one.

- en: Tarot is deeply personal. The number one thing to keep in mind is to find a
    deck that speaks to you and works for whatever your core purpose is. The Rider-Waite
    deck is a classic and dates back to about 1910.
  prefs: []

    familiarity with it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are so many options these days. You may as well start with something that feels
    designed for you and gets you excited.

    of professional readings? Do you use the tarot for meditation? Do you write novels
    from the imagery or journal?

    work well for it.

    tarot might not be inclusive enough for starting a general business.

    box cover. Now, actually try out what you’ve decided as your purpose.

    if that’s your purpose. But you can visualize a person sitting across from you.

    a tarot deck, someone has probably made it.

    tarot decks for beginners will almost always be best if they are on the classical
    side.

    life to explore, so there’s no harm in starting with something that makes learning

    (The Devil is called Cernunnos, the Celtic horned god, for instance). This shouldn’t
    be a problem, because you should read the card and not the name of the card.
