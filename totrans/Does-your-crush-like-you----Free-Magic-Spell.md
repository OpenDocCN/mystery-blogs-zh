 Slowly pour your water into the bowl while chanting
"O, (God/Goddess of Love's Name) does my crush like me,
Please help me with my love"
Then add your rose petals and make sure they are floating. Put one drop of oil on each petal. Then chant
"O, (God/Goddess of Love's Name) does he/she like me or does he/she not?"
Then put it in a secure place and wait seven days. After those days, depending on how much he/she loves, the rose petals will have dropped. If none dropped, he/she loves as much as you love them. If all of them dropped, they hate you. And also in between. I hope your crush likes you!
