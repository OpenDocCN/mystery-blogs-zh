# Extra Contraceptive (Females)

This spell serves as an extra measure of contraceptive much like a condom, birth control pill or the Plan B pill.

## Casting Instructions for 'Extra Contraceptive (Females)'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** This spell serves as an extra measure of contraceptive much like a condom, birth control pill or the Plan B pill. The more belief you have the more it will work. This should be cast anytime from when you had sex to no more than a week after. Dont cast after a week has passed your possible conception date. Simply chant:

"A night of passion
in a rushed fashion.
Not ready to be a mother
Grant my wish,
Please don't make me wonder.
Take this possible child away
Of this I pray.
So mote it be!"

Say as many times as you think necessary.

A few side notes:

*   You should probably consult a physician as well as doing this spell. I'm not a doctor.
*   And make sure you aren't wearing Amethyst or any other stones that aid in fertility because that will interfere with the spell until you take it off.
*   If you bleed sometime after you cast it, it means it definitely worked. (when I casted it at night and took off my amethyst, i bled a bit the next morning.)

I would use actual contraceptives and safeguards, not a chant. If you were to use it, though I doubt it would work, I would say the chant while taking/using contraceptives.
