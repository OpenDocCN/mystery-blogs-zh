    spell is fake and won't work.

    magic into something other than human.

- en: Roleplaying is against site rules. SpellsOfMagic is a site about real Pagans/Witches/Wiccans
    to discuss their faith. [while some cast spells as a hobby, a lot use magick in
    their religious practices, so making comments like ''in Harry Potter, this happened''
    can be insulting to other's religious beliefs] You can enjoy Harry Potter, but
    HP is a work of fiction. Magick in reality that this site is about isn't the same
    as fiction. In reality, magick doesn't physically transform humans into animals.

  prefs: []

- en: Those aren't ''facts'' since you were referencing a work of fiction. This would
    be considered roleplaying because this is a site to educate others and you quoted
    a work of fiction to argue why this spell could work. There was no reason to bring
    up Harry Potter since the above posts are three ''this doesn't work'' and one
    about the spell category. I'm simply warning you that using fiction as a way to
    validate your argument is considered roleplaying on the site and you could get
    in trouble if you continue.
