Why does no one comment

depends on the spell [go to the ''discussion'' tab, you'll see which spells have comments]

well it depends one people thoughts on the spell

I don't think this will work just by doing this. If you want this to work, try doing this before, after, or while you exercise.

Whats white gold energy? Im a baby witch. Sorry if this is a stupid question.

Just another way to say positive energy. The concept of white for positive/good and black for negative/bad energy has roots in racist constructs, so some witches are trying to shy away from black and white labels. Another way people see positive energy is golden like sunshine, and negative as a grey. However you perceive positive light is all that matters.
