Comfrey has been used to heal since the medieval times, to heal from skin wounds to broken bones. It is a well-used healing herb.

1\. Place the leaves, flower/oil and water in a blender and mix them up. You choose how much of each ingredient.

2\. Wrap the mixture in the cloth to make a small package and hold it against the wound for half an hour. The water will seep out but don't strain the mixture.

3\. Repeat four times a day with refreshed ingredients.

Once again, don't let the leaves get in the wound.
