 Sit cross legged on the floor or ground. It's better to do this outside as you're closer to Nature. Place both candle's side by side in front of you, Put your gift into the center, between both candles. Light your Sandalwood incent with your wooden matches, and put it behind you ( not to close for safety). Then light your candles and put all burnt matches in your Heat proof bowl. Then chant three times:

"I am strong, as I am pure.
You are my Spirit Element unseen.
Accept this Gift that you see,
In Return please protect me.
So mote it be"

Make sure to give thanks to Spirit and blow out the candles. Take your burnt matches and give them back to the earth. Burying in the ground is best.
