## Is Today Your Birthday?

How you come across to people in positions of authority is going to be of major importance over the coming 12 months. You may, in your opinion, be worth your weight in gold but if they see you as arrogant it could damage your ambitions.

### Aquarius

Tread carefully when dealing with people who don’t share your outlook on life. There is no reason why you should not be friends but with Mercury turning retrograde today if you say the wrong thing it could lead to a parting of the ways.

### Pisces

There may be no logical reason why you feel ill at ease but your sixth sense tells you that something is not quite right about your current situation, and your instincts are rarely wrong. Don’t commit yourself until you know for sure what’s what.

### Aries

If someone lets you in on a secret you must ask what’s in it for them. It could be they are giving you only half the story in the hope that you will make accusations against someone that they are too afraid to make themselves. Don’t fall for it.

### Taurus

Be wary of people who make you offers that seem too good to be true. You should know by now that few things in life come for free. Make sure you know what will be expected of you in return. It may be too high a price to pay.

### Gemini

Don’t make too big a deal of it if you have to give more than you get today. It may seem as if you are the one who is losing out but in the long-term you will gain in ways you had not expected. Good deeds never go unrewarded for long.

### Cancer

There is no point trying to keep something secret because family and friends can read you like an open book. The best move you can make today is to be entirely open and honest about what you’ve been up to. It’s really not that much of a big deal.

### Leo

There is no point trying to let others down gently if you have bad news to impart. Come right out with it and let them know what is going on, and what the consequences are likely to be. Honesty is always the best policy.

### Virgo

As your ruler Mercury begins one of its retrograde phases today it’s unlikely you will be thinking straight. Now that you know that you are less likely to make any spur of the moment decisions that could cost you money if you get them wrong.

### Libra

The more someone tries to pressure you into following their way of doing things the more you must resist. You should not give in to emotional blackmail for two reasons: first, because it’s unethical; second, because once it starts it never stops.

### Scorpio

Avoid situations where people try to control your comings and goings. You are a free individual and you are entitled to move around as you please. You are also entitled to make your own mistakes – so long as you also try to learn from them.

### Sagittarius

Whatever it is that is causing you so much anxiety you won’t get over it by pretending it does not exist. Look at the situation from various angles, then decide on a course of action that will take you past your fears. It will be easier than you think.

### Capricorn

Listen to what your inner voice tells you today and ignore those who say they know better than you. Maybe they do and maybe they don’t but either way it is you who has to call the shots, and live with the consequences if they are wrong.
