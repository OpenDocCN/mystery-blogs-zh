- en: Bring your hands together level with your left hip and ‘throw’ the energy from
    your hands to create a barrier in front of the door. This powerful spell should
    be sufficient to prevent all intrusion, but you could reinforce it by treating
    all other entrances in the same way and could also visualize small wheels at the
    windows. You might vary the technique by tracing a banishing pentagram on the
    door itself.
