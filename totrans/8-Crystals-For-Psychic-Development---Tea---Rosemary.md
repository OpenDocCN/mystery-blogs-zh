Crystals are hugely popular in the occult world, for good reason! Whether you’re a beginner divination student or an advanced witch, you’ll find that specific crystals for psychic development enhance your energy and unlock certain abilities that you might not know you have.

Of course, we don’t *need* crystals to practice divination or to become psychic. We all have that inner knowing already inside of us. I find that crystals help us tap into that inner knowing and enhance our energy.

The great thing about crystals is that you can choose your crystal based on your desired outcome. For example, you’ll choose a different crystal if you want to communicate with your angels than if you want to ground yourself.

Regardless of what psychic skill you’re trying to develop, crystals can assist you. Think of these energetic tools like little friends: they’re here to help! These crystals are all especially powerful if you’re working to develop your psychic skills and senses.

## Ways To Connect With A Crystal Psychically:

The first thing you should *always* do when you get a new crystal is to thoroughly cleanse it. Some crystals are self-cleansing, but most aren’t. Regardless, it never hurts to cleanse.

I like to leave my crystals on the windowsill overnight to cleanse. They get a bit of sunlight and a bit of moonlight (both of which are cleansing in different ways) and this resets the energy completely. You can also clean your crystals using incense (if you want quicker results) or by placing the crystal in sea salt for a bit.

Next, you need to connect with the energy of the crystal. Every crystal has its own energy and personality. You need to develop a relationship with your crystal that is specifically for the purpose of working on your psychic abilities.

I recommend sitting with your crystal in your hands and spending a few moments connecting with its energy. Feel the vibrations coming from your crystal. You can ask it if it would like to work with you to develop your psychic abilities. If the crystal doesn’t want to, then you won’t be able to use this specific crystal for the purpose of psychic development; keep going until you find one that is agreeable.

For the first few weeks, try to spend consistent time with your crystal. You can wear it, carry the stone around in your pocket, or meditate holding the crystal.

Once you have connected, you can continue doing all of these things while also using your crystal during divination practice. For example, you can place the crystal on your third eye or crown chakra when meditating, surround yourself with many crystals while working on divination, hold the crystal in your hand to access its energetic power, or sleep with your crystal under your bed or pillow to enhance psychic dreams.

The possibilities are endless!

## Crystals For Psychic Development:

Here are my 8 favorite crystals for psychic development!

### Amethyst:

Amethyst is a well-known crystal that can be found at most metaphysical shops. It can be anywhere from light purple to dark purple, although sometimes it is even clear or translucent.

Amethyst is a great crystal for psychic development. It works to open the Third Eye and Crown Chakras, so Amethyst is perfect for both beginner and advanced students. Amethyst is one of my favorite crystals for psychic clairvoyance and psychic protection, although the energy is really strong, so you need to be sure that you’re ready. If you’re just dabbling, a weaker crystal may be better.

At some point, I recommend that every witch or psychic invest in a good Amethyst crystal. Make sure to test the energy of the crystal to see how it wants to be used! **[Click here to shop for a great Amethyst crystal](https://rstyle.me/+aj7lRMp8hl5y_AOjjrJl-g) for psychic development.**

### Angelite:

If your divination goal is to communicate with your Angels or guides then Angelite is one of the best crystals for psychic development. Angelite is also a great crystal for mediumship and channeling if you want to communicate with the other side.

This is a very peaceful, relaxing crystal that allows you to cross over. I love using this crystal when I’m feeling anxious, but it’s also one of my favorite crystals for psychic work because it is so serene while raising a huge amount of awareness. It can also help you develop telepathic abilities.

If you work with chakras during your divination practice, then you can use Angelite for the Throat, Third Eye, and Crown Chakras.

### Azurite:

If you want crystals for psychic development that have to do with the “clairs” (e.g. clairvoyance, clairaudience, claircognizance), then Azurite is your best bet. This crystal has traditionally psychic properties and will open all of the psychic senses. It was used in ancient civilizations for powerful prophetic visions.

Azurite is also a great crystal for psychic development if you work with cards or tools such as the pendulum, Tarot, astrology, etc.

### Celestite:

If you’re looking for a crystal for psychic development that won’t overpower you, try Celestite. The energy of Celestite is gentle but incredibly useful when you’re developing psychic gifts. It does a bit of everything.

While Celestite is known as the crystal that connects you with your Angels, it’s also great for general communication with guides and with creatures from other realms and dimensions. It can even help you connect with your Higher Self or unconscious inner self. Celestite will help you transcend your consciousness to a higher plane.

Lastly, Celestite can simply help you connect with and trust in the universe.

### Charoite:

If you’re a bit nervous about developing your divination abilities, Charoite is one of the best crystals for psychic development practice. It’s super protective and will help you adjust to higher frequencies. Charoite is also associated with deep emotional and physical healing, so you will probably experience some sort of healing moment during your psychic practice.

Charoite is also a great crystal for healers to use, as it can help them to access their psychic abilities in order to heal.

### Labradorite:

Labradorite is one of the best crystals for psychic development if you need to “illuminate the way ahead.” Not only will it shed light on a situation when you’re hitting a wall or when you just can’t break through psychically, but it will protect you from anything negative while you work.

The energy of Labradorite quite literally forms a barrier to all negative energy. It also helps you to release the negative energy (such as fear or self-doubt) that you hold inside. Labradorite will instill faith and trust within you. It has quite a strong energy.

Labradorite is especially great when you’re working to enhance intuitive wisdom, clairvoyance, or visualization. Try using Labradorite for your next divination session or meditation.

### Lapis Lazuli:

Lapis Lazuli is a well-known stone that pairs with the Priestess card in Tarot, which is a personal favorite of mine. This stone will help you unlock your inner wisdom while remaining graceful. It has a strong feminine energy that is subtle yet powerful.

Lapis Lazuli will give you confidence in your psychic abilities while simultaneously unlocking your intuition.

### Moonstone:

Moonstone is a famous crystal in folklore and even on vampire TV shows, but most people don’t know that it’s one of the best crystals for psychic development. It is strongly connected to the moon, which signifies your intuition. Moonstone will enhance your psychic abilities during practice, but it can also bring psychic dreams and show the shadow self.

Moonstone is also great if you want to develop clairvoyance or clairsentience; it’s all about the self and about intuition. Use moonstone to access your unconscious mind or during past life regressions for huge results.
