You cannot become a mermaid.

Ya can if you get a mermaid tail accessory sa haaa

Technically yes, just buy a fake tail and wear it, but I think what Tadashi is referring to [and this spell is claiming] is that you could physically transform into a mermaid with magick and be a real half fish half human which is completely impossible to do.
