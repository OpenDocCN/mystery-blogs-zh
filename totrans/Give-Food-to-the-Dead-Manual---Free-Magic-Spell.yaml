    either for channeling the spirit or summon the spirit ,each realm have its own
    ruler , so please contact it before and the delivery would be much easy
  prefs:

    goes to food
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should remember that some angel for the deliver dead that is sometimes **humanoid
    with animal head** so sometimes is usefull to also give offering to the **demihuman**
    angel too like raw meat chicken? , cows blood which already dry?
  prefs:

- en: have its candle in corner ( i usually use 2 or 3 , but there are someone using
    4 ,which like **"4 of wands tarot"** which bring harmony)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about the color of candle ,in my opinion you should use it according to the
    channels,example: **eligor candle is yellow** but foras candle is orange ,this
    is all according to the frecuency of the spirit you gonna offer , even if the
    candle color is diffrent the fire color of candle is still same ,get lit the candle
    with (fire element) + incencse
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your has to be visualize the energy in Plasma(fire element) which more higher
    frecuency than air,lyquid,solid that it somehow connect between you and the spirit
    through some kind of **wormhole?** ,but wormhole? is not black , some person just
    see it directly in my mind ,just sense the frecuency
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after the preparation is ready is time for you to **contact the spirit asking
    to come** (there is some inchantion for some culture) and the important part is
    you give tell spirit that the **food or offering is theirs** , more visuals if
    you give them chair in table to eat&drink
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if there is so many spirit eat the food , you will suprised that if you eat
    the food after i**t will lose the taste** , its like tasteless ,i mean just less
    the seasoning?, or if you offer the cirgarete it would be **faster to be ashes**
    ,even though nobody suck it ,and weirdly if it is drink maybe 10%less will loss,
    i mean if we see the water height on the glass it just decreased
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most weird things if you do this in the forest which no human live ,i ever read
    a event in sites that the food just dissapear (maybe eaten by animal? , i dont
    think so?)

- en: 'The mechanism:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this things is like "symbolism" making a "Channel" now if project yourself to
    a place full of bread "bread shop", it somehow after you hungry it just sucked
    into you and you can **feel the taste without actually eating that bread**, nah
    this things works that way ,so we create things like "library data" "open world" 
    so the spirit is no need to Creating or visualizing so much to have the food ,
    they just simply come to the channel or **project to the channel** to enjoy the
    food , this work for "preta/hungry ghost too" we **provide the illusion for them**
    ,so they no need to find in other places or create it
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often dead people spirit is unable to just go from their not archived earthly
    things , its like you can go anywhere without walking legs ,so not so tired or
    heavy ,but they **often unable to control themself** ,so they just always go to
    their favourite lamborgini cars or just stick to their havings in earth ( note
    i dont know more information about this ,if you have more understanding just tell
    me ,this is just as far as i know)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most things i really know that the spirits which dependent by body when they
    die they feel **so much energy drop** and tiredness ,**also hard to control**
    , not like in film which it just go around the body without feel the pain (for
    usual people),thats why dont go to see the new dead people because sometimes they
    **sucking your energy** or maybe posses or just stick your back( **sometimes in
    case of traffic accident ,and you see their corpse**)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most importanly if it is ancestor spirit , they always wants **attention from
    their descendant** ,thats why placing a tombstone could make we remember , its
    more better if you invite them ,However , times like **Halloween month** is more
    easy to invite the dead

- en: 'Burn The offerings:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you must ask the spirit do they done eating and also if you running out the
    time tell them that we cannot longging the time this has to be done with some
    sort of divination or spirit contact tools, also give thanks for the **demihuman
    angel** too and the **realm ruler**
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so put a fire in a "yajna" , and **circling a bowl (to the burning place) **of
    prayed water/ashes/soil would open the gate(with inchantion) so after burned the
    things will be transfered to the target spirit , you could just burn the foods
    or bone or dried blood or flower ,after the spirit really done eating, **then
    burn a little amount of food **
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before burn the offerings you should use **the key opener paper spell** to Lit
    the flame ,usually the paper is very long and not width paper ,**lit the flame
    from the candle in the table flame**
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the important things is you must connect to fire,spirit,offerings at once **do
    not think that food is burned** , think or visualize as the **offering is now
    delivered to spirit by fire frecuency** , thats why in the first place we need
    to circling open gate ,**dont let the fire die** in process ,keep fire still burning
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: after a long offering process now **you must close the gate** by inchantion
    to close with that bowl of prayed water/ashes/soil circling the burning place
    again ,say **thanks to your helper** in the end

- en: 'Mechanism:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: remember solid(earth),lyquid(water),gas(wind),plasma(fire),ether(spirit) ,so
    fire is more higher frecuency ,because the dead dont have solid&lyquid things
    like body so we need to contact them with **higher frecuency** ,ether is in your
    mind & will ,thats why making gate using 2 candle  like "high priestess tarot"
    J & B pillar , ida & pingalla , 2 pilar in kabbalah is important to help us connect
    to spirit
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also its work like **"wifi""electromagnetic wave"** stuff , unbounded by material
    and not using cable or without medium , so after you burn it ,**the things will
    transform by fire** to be like "data""energy""astral form" etc, and send it (from
    the cloud storage) like wifi sends to phone or repeater , then in the phone we
    could see the image and enjoy the video , in  this case it not only send visual
    but all 5 senses and more
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: opening and closing the chanel is important ,without the direction "Website
    Address" "email Address" "ip-address" its useless ,and after opened it must be
    closed , so no other bad things or unwanted things go using your channel to the
    spirit ,just like making a portal in Dr.Strange movie ,
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: visualization about offering needed ,to make transform by fire gone like what
    you gonna offer to the spirit , in some culture they make clothes from paper that
    colored and painted ,but the goal is to make the spirit having fabric clothes
    ,and not paper clothes ,you also can burn a chocolate for uncared dead kid spirit
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: im sure this spell is not so complete ,because i dont write down the inchation
    to open the gate either to the offering table candle and the circling bowl , things
    like this is so **native to Asian country** especially chinese to invite/remembering
    the dead, and so many words is hard to tell in this things ,Please complete this
    spell if you can ,so it would be more perfect
