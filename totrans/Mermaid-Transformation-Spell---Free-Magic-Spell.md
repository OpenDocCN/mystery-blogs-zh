*   Hard breathing
*   Dry skin
*   Dehydration (during lots of water to ovoid that)
*   Weak legs

*   Chill mood

When you become a mermaid you will most likely need to move to an area near an ocean. No one is to know of your mermaid tail or powers. Do not be alarmed. Mermaids don't wear clothes so when you join the others in the ocean you will need to be completely naked because that is the way all mermaids are. If you are pregnant or are going to become pregnant refrain from water areas because it is more difficult to give birth with a tail.
