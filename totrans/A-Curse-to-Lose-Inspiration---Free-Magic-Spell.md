 ## Casting Instructions for 'A Curse to Lose Inspiration'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A needle and thread

*   A taglock

*   String (optional)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A cloth poppet

*   A needle and thread

*   A taglock

*   A curse sigil to lose inspiration

*   Cotton balls

*   String (optional)

*   Sand or dirt

*   Toxic herbs (optional)

*   A jar

*   Honey or molasses (optional)

 1.  Create a poppet of your target. Insert a taglock in its chest, or draw a likeness of their face on the poppet’s head.
2.  Some ideas for taglocks: hair, nail clippings, a copy of their handwriting, an object of theirs, a picture of them, a copy of their fingerprint, etc.
3.  Draw a curse sigil for losing inspiration and wrap it around the taglock. Alternatively, draw it on the back of the poppet’s head, opposite of the face (if you drew one).
4.  Fill the inside of the head with cotton balls, to fog up their mind and muddle their thoughts. You could, alternatively, tangle up some string into a ball to have their thoughts tangled and confused.
5.  Weigh down the poppet’s limbs with sand or dirt, so the target is heavy, sluggish, and unmotivated to do the things they need to do.
6.  If you have access to any poisonous herbs, you can put some in the chest of the poppet to “poison” their creativity and drive.
7.  Remember to always, always, always research any poisonous herbs you plan to use thoroughly, and take whatever precautions necessary to keep yourself safe - you don’t want to hurt yourself just to hurt someone else!
8.  Seal the poppet shut, with the intentions of trapping all the negativity inside them, and preventing any inspiration from going in.
9.  Finally, pop that poppet in a jar, and fill it with honey or molasses - some sort of viscous liquid - to keep the target stuck.
10.  Put the jar in a dark place, to keep them in the dark.
