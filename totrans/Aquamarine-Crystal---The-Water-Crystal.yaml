    Amaria and I write about all things Witchcraft, Wicca and Magick. Lately, we’ve
    been covering a lot of crystal related topics, like this post on [crystal witchcraft](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-witchcraft/),
    this guide to [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/) or
    this article on [fluorite](https://wiccanow.com/fluorite/). Today I thought we’d
    focus on another beautiful crystal, namely aquamarine.

- en: '**Aquamarine is a variety of [beryl](https://wiccanow.com/beryl/) and takes
    its name from the Latin *aqua marina *meaning “water of the sea”. The crystal
    ranges in colour from translucent to opaque blue and aqua. The ancient Greeks
    believed the stone to be a mermaids treasure and often carried a piece of aquamarine
    with them as a talisman, believing that it would keep them safe at sea. The stone
    can be found in Brazil, Africa and the United States. During the middle ages,
    the stone was believed to counteract the effects of poison and was often used
    for medicinal purposes. In China, it was used to fashion figurines and small trinkets
    and in Turkey, aquamarine was often used to adorn the hilts of swords.**'
