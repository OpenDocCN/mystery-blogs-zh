- en: Greetings Brother. I want to perform this spell to heal many of my loved ones.
    I would like to alter the spell a little bit, by writing the type of illness under
    the person's name and burning it on the white candle. Will this make it more powerful?
    And would I need to leave the candle burning?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It definitely wouldn't weaken the spell. I would suggest writing the name, the
    illness, and a statement of your desired outcome like ''May this harm be healed''.

- en: Burning the paper would be akin to releasing your wish/prayer to the aether
    for the gods to receive. ... Like mailing a letter. And once the paper is burned
    and the working complete I would say that leaving the candle to burn down or no
    is up to you. Obviously a longer burn and the longer time you spend observing
    it burn while in contemplation of your prayer means a greater input of effort
    and care on your part. So take it as you will and decide for yourself how much
    time you feel you should dedicate to the process.

- en: One suggestion though. Don't 'demand' action from your patron. That is generally
    rude and also presumptive/hubristic. Imagine you are an adult with a candy, and
    two children you don't know well (but know... the neighbour's kids or something)
    walk up to you. One SAS ''I'm hungry and I would like some candy, may I please
    have a piece?'' While the other says ''I need your candy, give it!'' ... Who would
    you give it to?

    address them directly and with respect. Recognize them for who they are and the
    importance of what they do. And, if you want to garner better favor then having
    an offering with you to give, regardless of potential response, goes a very long
    way. Hand-bake some bread. Pour a shot of bourbon. Bring some flowers from your
    garden that you have worked to grow. Whatever it is as long as it is something
    your deity likes and as long as it took effort from you to get grow or make, then
    it will be meaningful.

    is having a really bad day and I think he would be much happier if I could give
    him some candy. But I don't have any and don't know where to get it. I bet he
    would be really happy if you were to go over and give him some of what you have
    though. ...by the way, here! I planted some seeds with mom in spring, and looked
    after them all summer. They made lots of roses so I wanted to give one to you.
    You can have it either way.''

    them in your head. But think about how they made you feel as you read them. Which
    you would help. ... food for thought.
