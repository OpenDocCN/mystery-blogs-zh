    It may be difficult to differentiate between the two, but remember; the sun is

    selfish, but they will do what is best for themselves in any given situation.

- en: Mercury in Leo people try to present themselves as very confident in their convictions,
    but underneath they may be more sensitive. Leo is the lion– it is forceful and
    exuding, but it also spends 23 hours a day sleeping and having its needs catered
    to. This is similar to Mercury in Leo– they like to have people around who will
    cater to their mental needs.

    literally yell that they do not have time for someone else’s problem. Mercury
    in Leo, on the other hand, will simply just circle back to themselves.
