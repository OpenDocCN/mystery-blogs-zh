    weeds, roots, barks, and the flowers of any plant used for healing, magic spells
    and rituals, witchcraft, Wicca, or other purposes. Resins are concentrated, partially
    dehydrated derivatives of the liquid or sap of trees and plants and are commonly
    used in the same manner as herbs. Animal products like musk and ambergris are
    used similarly to resins and herbs, but primarily for their scents.'

    gained through the ingestion or application of certain plants. Likewise with the
    magical aspects of herbs, only this use is limited to humans. For thousands of
    years humans have used herbs and herbal concoctions for with the intent of altering
    their world.
