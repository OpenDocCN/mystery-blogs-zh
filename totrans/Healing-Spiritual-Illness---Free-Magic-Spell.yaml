- en: A spiritual illness can be felt in a variety of ways. There may be a feeling
    of being totally drained, usually a result of depression (which is an illness
    of the spirit as well as of the mind), there may be addictions, there may be a
    string of bad luck, poor social relationships etc. Spiritual illness can also
    produce physical illness.If it is you that is suffering from this illness, cast
    a circle and then visualize white light streaming from above into you. You should
    be able to feel this light like a warm wave of love. It is the love of The Goddess
    and of the spirits of your ancestors and guardians that you carry with you always.
    Concentrate on realizing that you are a Star of God sent into this world for spiritual
    experience and that the difficulties you are experiencing are only temporary and
    are a necessary part of your journey to spiritual enlightenment.Incantation:Great
    Goddess and all you spirits of love that surround me, bring me blessings.Be with
    me now and forever.If this healing is for someone else, you will of course have
    to persuade them to be involved in this-if the person is a big cynic, this can
    be a difficult task, so perhaps one of the other healing spells would be a better
    choice. But if the person is into it, cast a circle, then, as before, visualize
    white light streaming from above, into your head, and through your body. Then
    lay your hands (which will probably have a slight to moderate tingling feeling)
    on the person and send the energy flowing into them.Incantation:You are filled
    with the white light of The God/dess.You are a Star of God.You are surrounded
    by loving spirits.Great God/dess and all you spirits of love that surround (person's
    name), bring him/her blessings.Be with him/her, now and forever.

- en: The visualizations are common energy-working techniques, and they are combined
    with a basic chant to bring focus onto the intent of healing (along with being
    an appeal for help from higher sources).

- en: The principles behind this working are simple, but sound. It would be a good
    way to attract and bring inward ideas of health, peace, and connection with the
    divine. I would recommend adding slightly to it though. While visualizing the
    'drawing down' of the white light, positivity, and loving warmth try to imagine
    it as not just coming to you- But filling you with it, washing over you, and releasing
    the tensions, fears, worries, and heaviness of any overall dis-ease within you.
    Like the water from a warm shower washing dirt off of your skin.
