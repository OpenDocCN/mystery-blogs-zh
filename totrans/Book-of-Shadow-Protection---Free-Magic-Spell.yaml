    just another book on the shelf. I've heard of some where others in the house even

- en: what does 'BOS' stand for?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Book of Shadows. It is a witch's journal, where you put information, spells,
    dreams, experiences from AP(Astral Projection), and more. You can choose what
    you want. You can even hide your BOS from prying eyes, with the spell above as
    a technique.

- en: This should be effective for any book you want. The working is in effect a glamour
    intended to help the chosen object be below conscious notice. Or, basically, hidden
    in plain sight.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a note, it still helps if the book is something that already blends in and
    seems like it belongs. Keep the book alongside other books on your shelf. So it
    is one among many. If it is somewhere it wouldn't normally belong (like between
    the nattresses) then it will stand out and grab attention instead. It will present
    a mystery to be solved, which creates a desire to investigate and is counter-productive.
    The more protective you are of a thing, the more people will want to know - why-
    you are protecting it.

- en: If it is a notebook, keep it with your other notebooks. If it is a hardcover,
    keep it among your other hardcovers. If it is a binder, set it with your schoolwork
    as if it was just for another topic you were studying. If it is some form of album
    or scrapbook, keep it with your art supplies. ...That sort of thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oh, and the only foolish question is the one that goes un-asked. Questions remove
    ignorance- It is within statements that ignorance is revealed. ... Unless the
    question is; How much wood could a woodchuck chuck? That question is silly, because
    **everyone knows** that a woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could
    chuck! *Nods sagely*
