    accomplish great things. Even if you don’t use them wisely you will still gain
    in some way, but 12 months from now you may look back and wonder what might have
    been.

    you may be disappointed. Also, make sure that what you claim as your own is not
    already in someone else’s possession. You’ll have a tough time taking it from
    them.

    you. You may be a nice guy by nature but you are human like everyone else and
    are entitled to have favorites, and enemies. Dislikes are every bit as valid as
