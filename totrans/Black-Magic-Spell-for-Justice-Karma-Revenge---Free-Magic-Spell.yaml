- en: We are using a Black Candle to deal with setting hexes, bring about justice,
    and Karma, night magic, and truth. Saturday is in correspondence with Saturn,
    Hecate and lends power to justice, and karma. The wayning moon cycle addresses
    binding and crone magic. The number of days is eight because eight lends power
    to binding, justice, and karma. The time of midnight corresponds with revenge.
    The Goddess Hecate will be invoked to bring about a hex, karma, black and crone
    magic, and revenge. The God Vishnu deals directly with justice, and karma. The
    herbs being burned as incense for this spell correspond to hexes (dill), Justice
    (dill), karma (anemone), and the earth (salt). This is a black magic spell. Be
    careful in casting. If you want to be really nasty burn the candle for 11 days.
    The number 11 deals with hexes.

    I dont see a specific ritual here, either.

- en: This would be a spell. You don't need chants or to call on specific deities
    and spiritual beings to cast a spell. This spell relies more on the energy you
    charge and date/number correspondences. Everything has energy you can utilize
    daily to bring magick into your life [choosing to wear an orange shirt when you
    need confidence for example] So this is a spell, it just relies on your energy
    more than items and deities assistance. [I cast one once where I charged a needle
    with energy and stabbed some gum and it worked within 24 hours, the person was
    caught and fined]
