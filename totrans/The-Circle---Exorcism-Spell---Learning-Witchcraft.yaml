- en: This type of exorcism is suitable for covens that are able to quickly gather
    several witches. With this method, instead of relying on an incantation or formula
    that exploits the evil spirit’s weaknesses, the circle, draws in the raw magickal
    power of the witches.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, all you need is for the witches to stand in the circle around the possessed
    person. The witches hold each other’s hands and repeat an incantation ordering
    the victim’s release from the demon. This will send important positive and powerful
    healing energy into the possessed victim.

- en: It should only be a few minutes before the pressure of the positive energy,
    as it flows into the circle, will crack most demons. This will force the demon
    to leave. All you need to do is banish the spirit, which may have already fled.

    it will also transfer the spirit to an inanimate object so that it can be trapped.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, you need to have as much information as possible about the spirit. This
    includes the sprit’s name and purpose. You need to know if the spirit has special
    powers and if it’s related to one of the four elements of nature, more than the
    others.

- en: This information will be used to write an incantation to expel the demon, by
    taking advantage of the demon’s weaknesses. In addition to the incantation, you
    will need an object to contain the demon, like a small stone. You will also need
    a sheet of paper to write the demon’s name.

    the demon. This paper will be burned during the ritual, using a candle dedicated
    for this purpose.
