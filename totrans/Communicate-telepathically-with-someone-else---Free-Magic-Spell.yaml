    is not like movies or TV shows where you could use telepathically instead of a
    cell phone, but this spell can help you if you want to talk to someone else with
    anyone else knowing. Also it would be best if you call upon the power of the elements
    to aid you in the spell, by saying ''''Wind, Earth, Fire, Water, I call to you
    to make this spell magic so mote it be'''' (Date posted: 2/23/17)'
