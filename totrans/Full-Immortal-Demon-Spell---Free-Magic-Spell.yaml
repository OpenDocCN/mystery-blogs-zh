    spells you have put down, besides don't you have anything better to do then going
    through all the spell sub categories and putting millions of spells down.

    only tried baked salmon? Have you tried teriyaki? You can't be allergic to all
    salmon if you haven't tried every type.'' If you actually know how magick works,
    what is and isn't possible, you don't have to try every spell to confirm it's
    fake. Tadashi's free to post facts about spells, and if he chooses to only call
    out the fake ones that's his choice, just as it's your choice to remain ignorant
    to the reality of real magick [in other words you're human and nothing will change
    that fact]

    due to factors out of your control [they have a bad day for example. In written
    text, we can''t hear your tone. I''m not offended, I just wanted to comment on
    that] True, people can believe whatever, but there is a line. You can believe
    vaccines are dangerous and choose not to vaccinate your kids. You have the right
    to ignore the facts and believe that, but you put people at risk. We are trying
    to explain it isn''t possible. If someone reads the explanation and still chooses
    to believe, that''s fine. My hope, in that case, is one day they discover the
    truth for themselves, and on that day, they are willing to adjust their view.
    [that''s going for myself and the other members who try to teach in the comments.
    We are always growing and learning. To quote Daria: ''''Stand firm for what you
    believe in, until and unless logic and experience proves you wrong.'''' I honestly
    can''t tell you the number of times I believed something only to learn something
    new and change my worldview because of it.]'

    to become immortal you could take on the powers of a demon and live as long as
    they do which is definitely longer than a human. worth a try.
