 ## Casting Instructions for 'Money Draw Candle Working'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A green candle.

*   Sandalwood oil.

*   Sigil.

 I began by dressing a green candle with sandalwood oil. Sandalwood is great to bring a little extra power to a working.

Next I created a sigil to attract money in. This sigil can be carved into a larger pillar candle. For my working I am using a votive and use the sigil underneath on a paper. 

For my sigil I used the phrase Old Money. 

Ldmny.

I used all capital letters and arranged these within a circle to create a unique sigil. 

I placed the sigil when finished under the votive candle. The candle is then lit to attract extra finances.
