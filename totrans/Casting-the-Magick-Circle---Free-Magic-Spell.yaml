    Point your wand to the ground and imagine a line being drawn on the ground as
    you move in the circle. Draw your circle so you hit the quarters in the order
    of north, east, south, and west. After you have drawn the circle, go to the northern
    part of your circle with the crystal. Chant the following:'

    out of a tent. Be sure to close the door behind you so not to let the magick out!
    Every time you open the "door," the circle gets weaker.
