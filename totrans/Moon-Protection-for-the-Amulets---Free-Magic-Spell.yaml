    you are also taking in the power from the Moon as well. This is best done at the
    time of the Full Moon.

    an object has been blessed by the Moon, you enter under her protection. You symbolically
    take in her power by drinking the water. Amulets are seemingly inanimate objects
    which have been given power by the incantation.

    non-toxic. If it is toxic, you can place it beside the glass of water for the
    same result.
