    put this information. I don't know how too start a thread or the category too

    hunted now in the dark shadows.

    i understand with these people, as it is better for them, and for others that
    certain information is not given out freely. But i will give what i think may
    in tern unite the two peoples agenst the actual threat, the actual evil. And as
    knowledge is power i will give as much detail as i can on the evils that plague
    this universe.

    does not mean you are or can become one just by believing, just as a white man
    cannot become asian through belief. And if you are but only a human remember that
    humanity overpowered the creatures and forced them into hiding. There is nothing
    quite like a human souls strength.

                           these are a people who serve under one master, they are
    considered a myth, a scary story too share among friends, as many of these things
    are. They may seem like mind slaves but they are not, they are individuals each
    with there own personality, ethnicity, and even other creature race. They choose
    too do there masters bidding which gives them purpose. They do some relitivly
    bad things, but like I've already stated im listing those who need others too
    fear them first. Too know your a proxy it's simple, your boss will show up and
    mark you painfully, it's hard too not know if you are or are not. Usually proxys
    are short men with a large black hoodie and a mask designed too scare. Some basic
    abilities they usually have are teleportation and combat skill. They also almost
    always carry a knife. So long as they do not target you they are not a threat
    too you. These people fight against the true evil, so even though they do some
    bad things they can still be considered an ally.

                     if i told anyone the exact names id be considered delusional,
    it is really hard too believe in these people exsisting, but yet they do. It's
    a sad tale of these. A story involving two who should not be named, a good inventor
    and a bad inventor, both geniuses. The good one had lost so much wishing he could
    bring back his dead, while the bad was in a constant search for immortality. They
    paired together too build mechanisms giving bodys too the dead. But through there
    experements there was more loss, as the bad inventor saught murder too obtain
    fresh souls, the bad inventor decided that a young soul would be easier too manipulate
    when the clockwork came too life, tormenting and breaking the young too use there
    souls and bring up an obedient army, while the good inventor strived too free
    the children stuck in the clockwork. And now,  all the clockwork people wish for
    is too be free. Or they have become too broken in their mind too want anything
    but too stop the pain by serving the bad inventor. When you see one it will be
    obvious, but they are good at hiding away from the world. If you are one i am
    sorry that this is your fate. But this is another one that you will know if you
    are one. For needs, well they are clockwork after all, so repairs are needed when
    they are damaged. As for power once again they are clockwork, though some are
    merely but a soul pretending too be one as they were killed without a proper vessel.
    The ones who are but a soul are stronger than those who are not. This is more
    of a tragity than a race of those who are more capable of helping.

                        there is not much known about these interesting individuals,
    they are kind at heart and deeply loyal too each other, they serve one main purpose,
    they hide what they think needs too be hidden. They are mysterious in there ways
    and power but they are each individually strong. These also thrive off of fear
    and usually feed off of those who are in between the dream plane and the first
    plane of each universe. The "sleep paralisis demon" is nothing more than a shadow
    feeding off fear. There are a lot of things that like too pretend they are shadows
    but too know a shadow as a shadow you must know there looks. They look like a
    dark spot, darker than a normally cast shadow. They also have two white eyes most
    of the time. There are also those who have red eyes, but id advise avoiding the
    red eyed shadows at all costs, as the ones with red eyes usually have malicious
    intent twords something that you'd better hope is not you. There are also a lot
    of things that pretend too be a shadow, being just a black blob is a really good
    way too hide what you really are. If you are a shadow or are pretending too be
    one, once more it's hard too miss.

- en: Vampiric souls:                                                             
                 these aren't the best too be around, as they essentially steal your
    life essence and power through your blood. Thankfully most if not all were killed
    while creatures were still being hunted before they started needing too hide.
    "Vampiric" and "cannibalistic" entities thrive and can only survive off of certain
    things humans have in there blood and body. Essentially needing too eat humans
    like humans need too eat iron or protein. As i said before all vampires are at
    this point dead, but not all of the canibles are dead. Instead it's treated like
    a desise and there is a charity fund for these rare-ish conditions, and now instead
    of eating people they just get a shot in the arm every once and a while.

                      there is a race of people who can shift there bodys too become
    something else. Whatever they can imagine there bodys can become with enough foucus
    and practice, a lot like how squids, or chameleons can change there body colour
    and shape. Need wise they are no different then any human besides maybe eating
    more too sustain drastic change too there form. Looks wise, well there shape shifters,
    so id have as good a guess as you'd have, and there ability is in the name. A
    more well known type of shape shifting is werewolves, a shape shifter powered
    by the energy of the full moon can gain extra strength and agility, though the
    point of becoming a furry man dog while doing so is beyond me. Best way too know
    if your a shape shifter is too try a shape shifting spell, if it does not work
    then your probably not a shape shifter.

                      most were slain in medieval times. I think that it's self explanatory
    if youve seen just about anything regarding draggons. Giant fire breathing flying
    lizards. That are as extinct as the other giant reptiles but were more rare.

                          ah yes the dead. Not much too say here, the dead don't usually
    need that much, they have verrying ranges of ability, and there not going too
    stick around longer than three days unless there only posing as the dead or posess
    a body. But i thought they were still worth mentioning.

                                life on other planets is possible, but a lot like
    the ghosts i don't know enough of them too say much about them. Besides of course
    listing them here. Just remember that humanity is the dominant race on earth due
    too our violent tendencies, collective understanding, and really strong souls.
    We might because of this be the dominant race in every galaxy so far.

                          these are a people of servitude. Their exsistance is too
    serve the king of all gods, and too worship him day and night. They do however
    have enough free will too fall, rebell against the king, and disobey. Angels usually
    are about ten feet tall men and women who have perfect facial features and are
    essentially beautiful. They are often given whatch over the kings children, or
    are sent too deal with a problem in the spirit. These things are extremely powerful
    even when cast away from heaven onto the earth. One angel can often face a god
    and end up victorious. But be warned of the fallen angels, they are only exiled
    too the earth because they became something not good. The worst of these is one
    of the evils i write about in this noted thing. Angels have no known needs.

                                  all the last of these were slain by David the giant
    hunter. Giants while they were alive were the offspring of fallen angels and humans.
    They absolutely hated humanity but we're basically larger stronger ten times more
    violent humans with weak souls. Empowered by the king of the god's David started
    with goliath, and ended once all giants were dead, using nothing more than a slingshot
    and some rocks blessed by the king of the gods.

                          these are essentially extremely powerful creatures that
    humans spoiled with ritches and things too apese them. Now in a lot of different
    magical spells people still call apon these gods too empower what they are doing
    and assist the magic. Idles are however not gods. But gods can inhabit idles as
    gods are likely powerful enough too shrink themselves down and enter a simple
    statue. Too become a god like being all you need is a lot of power and a cult.
    Not all gods get along, but they listen too the chain of command by rank of power,
    they also dislike most creatures that are not a god. none of these gods are more
    powerful than the king who's power is only limited by impossible moral standards,
    because of these standards the king dosent help preform magic sadly, but he can
    fix most problems in life depending on what your willing too give up for him.
    No one can gaze appon the king without instantaneous death so i can't really discribe
    anything more than just a ball of light.

    said before there is not much as powerful as a human soul. The evil that plagues
    all worlds wishes nothing more than too collect this power in various ways in
    hopes too one day overthrow the king of the gods too bring anarchy, and distruction
    too all worlds. These are the seven devil heads and the man that is sin. I do
    not know all seven devil heads, and i do not know each name or purpose, but i
    can share what i do know of these. Just as i have shared what i do know of the
    creatures when i don't know all of them.

    So it wheres a mask. I don''t know for sure that this is the devil head of fear
    but it''s my best guess as he is the one who usually shows up if you seek the
    devil out of fear. He compherts his victims until they give it there allegiance,
    while also bringing its victims worst nightmares too life so that they cling too
    it more losing there soul in the process. I don''t know it''s real name but the
    poor souls it collects are used too create more monsters for its private collection

    collect. Or if your talking mental illness the voices in your mind telling you

    Through that act people share a peace of there soul with there partner, it also
    releases chemicals in the brain that make people feel good. But it is not good,
    as her children learn too steal the peaces that are given durring that act. I

    the other heads or are used another way. Lucifer is an angel, and can get into
    a persons mind, but don''t be fooled he is weaker than a human soul, and as such
    can be resisted. he also has no legs and absolutely hates bei3 reminded of that
    fact. It''s honestly fun taunting him at times. His real skill lies in his tricks
    and manipulative tactics, often sending something fear made in his place too be

    responsible for choosing not too act appon those dark thoughts. The devil heads
    obey the man that is sin but do not realise he is the one who coordinates this,
    instead giving Lucifer the blame. He is the plague that is in our world and is
    a devastating threat if his servants lead him too doing the impossible and winning
    a fight he can't win with the king of the gods. The war is already over because
    even with every human soul in all universes the man that is sin will never become
    strong enough too defeat the king of the gods. Does not mean he won't try. Because
