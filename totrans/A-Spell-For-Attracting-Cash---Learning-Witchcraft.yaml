- en: Place the spices and coins inside of the bag. Take the gold thread and tie four
    knots in it and do the same thing to the silver thread. Tie the bag using these
    knotted threads. Put your bag someplace safe – preferably in a dark, cool place
    – and leave it in that spot for eight days. If no extra money has made it to you
    by then, cast this spell again. It may take some time for your spell to weave
    its magic, like all spells.
