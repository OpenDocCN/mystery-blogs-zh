# Lupin the thirds masculine charm. (FTM friendly.)

As an FTM trans teen, and huge fan of the anime Lupin the third, I have made a spell that gives you the main character-Arsene Lupin the thirds masculine charm since I kin as him. This can be used if youre biologically male or FTM (regardless of your transition status).

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A jacket that is of one of the colors Lupin wears in the anime or movies (green, red, pink, or blue).

*   A tie that coordinates with the color jacket (green jacket-yellow tie, red jacket-pink or red or yellow tie, pink jacket-red tie, blue jacket-red tie).

*   A pair of pants thats either khaki colored or light colored.

*   A button down shirt thats dark blue or black.

*   A belt.

*   An electronic device to look at pictures of Lupin and listen to the OST/soundtrack.

*   Things for fixing/styling your hair: hair gel or pomade and scissors (only if your bangs are too long).

*   A combination of intent and pure and confident belief.

*   Things to make scent: lavender essential oil, witch hazel, a small glass spray bottle, cedar wood essential oil, and water.

## Casting Instructions for 'Lupin the thirds masculine charm. (FTM friendly.)'

 **(This spell mostly involves dressing like Lupin the third. To be clear, NOT REALLY in a form of cosplay but kind of. As a Lupin the third kin, I am blessing you all who do this spell with his confidence and his masculine charm.)**

**Part one-intention: Four days before casting this spell, no matter what the moon phase is go stand outside on a clear night. Look at the star closest to the moon while holding your electronic device (like a cell phone) that has a picture of Lupin the third pulled up on the internet browser. Doesn't matter what color jacket he's wearing in the image. And either out loud or mentally state the following: ****"I am ready to be confident. I am ready to have masculine charm. I am ready to have the confidence and masculine charm like Lupin the third." Say that while glancing at the star, and the image three times.**

**Before we move onto part two, if you're trying to manifest your twin flame, now is a good chance to manifest them.**

**Part two-Making the good stuff: Next, two days before casting this spell AFTER setting intentions, make the scent. In a small glass spray bottle, fill it about three quarters full of water, then another three quarters full of witch hazel. Next, add 10-25 drops of cedar wood essential oil, and 15-20 drops of lavender essential oil. Screw on the top of the spray bottle, put the cap back on and shake it well. Let it sit in a dark place away from sunlight till you're ready to use it. 
Before we move onto part three, it might be a good idea to spray it on you and let the scent invigorate you. Doesn't it smell nice and masculine?**

**Part three-The transformation begins: The day you plan on doing this spell (finally!), get dressed like Lupin. Put on the dark blue or black button down shirt and khaki or light colored pants. Then, ****look at your hair. If the top part of your hair/bangs are too long, I would highly recommend using scissors to cut them. Look at a picture of Lupin for reference. His bangs are in a short V-shape on his forehead in the middle. (If your bangs are just right already, just skip this step.) Then, use hair gel or pomade (a little bit, not a lot!) to fix the style. Then, put on the belt, tie and jacket. Make sure the tie color coordinates with the color jacket. Spray yourself with the scent you made, and affirm: "I am confident like Lupin. I have masculine charm like him. Ladies/other guys like me and will want to hang out/ask me out/want to date me."**

**You will feel masculine and confident. You will also radiate self love energies, and others will feel it because of how powerful it is. You might even meet your twin flame. (Not promising anything in regards to that.) Expect this to wear off in about 24-72 hours, but it could vary on the person. **

I like this. It doesn't claim to change your physical self but allows you to change your physical looks yourself. Great job!

Will this physically transform you into the character? No. Will the physically change your gender? No. HOWEVER, as a confidence spell and glamour, it has potential. As the creator said, this will help you be like the character. Reading this over, there are a few minor adjustments I would make. The biggest one being the chant. I understand you preform the first half in anticipation for the actual spell, but it is a little pointless, and the chant undermines itself. Chants and affirmations should state facts because you are telling the universe what you desire. ''I am like Lupin'' would work better than ''I will be like Lupin'' because one is confident and the other is a desire. Also, I question the timeframe of the spell, because it is hard to specify how long a spell works, so it makes me question how real this spell is. Dressing up like Lupin, say you are confident and manly, wearing a scent associated with male energies, all of these are fine. I would enchant the scented mist you created. After casting this spell, use the spray before leaving the house. Look in the mirror, spray your body, and say the chant ''I am as confident as Lupin. I am as masculine as Lupin. I am as charming as Lupin.'' This would work to charge your energy, cast a glamour, and make people perceive you how you desire. Also, this can be altered for any character you admire. You will still look like you, but your energy and others perception of you will change.
