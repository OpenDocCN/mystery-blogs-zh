- en: Because magick is a neutral energy found in nature. Magick is a part of nature
    and on the physical, it's ruled by nature. If a spell contradicts nature, it won't
    work because magick doesn't contradict nature. Humans can't physically transform,
    therefore, no spell will make you physically transform. If you wish to transform
    on the astral plane, or do a mental shift, or bring change to your life like you
    want to quit a habit or start a new job, these spells are possible because they
    either bring change on a different plane of existence, or it's helping you get
    something you could do on your own without magick [it'll just be easier because
    you're charging the energy around you to attract that change]
