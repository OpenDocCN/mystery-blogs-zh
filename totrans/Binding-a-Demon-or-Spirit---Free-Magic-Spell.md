# Binding a Demon or Spirit

  Rated 5/5 Stars

I wrote this spell, to bind and trap a certain unwelcome spirit.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Binding a Demon or Spirit'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 Name of the spirit, if possible

*   2 Triangle of The Arts

*   3 Stones or candles representing the 5 elements

*   4 Charm or Vessel to contain the spirit

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 Name of the spirit, if possible

*   2 Triangle of The Arts

*   3 Stones or candles representing the 5 elements

*   4 Charm or Vessel to contain the spirit

 As you cast your circle, invite the Guardians of the Watchtowers of the north, east, south, and west to witness you workings.

Place your triangle in the center of the circle, and within it place your "charm" or "vessel".

Around your triangle, form a pentagram with your stones/candles in appropriate positions.

Clear your mind, as you chant:

> **"Powers of the witches rise
> Course unseen across the skies
> Hear me beckon, hear my plea
> Spirit (name of spirit)*
> I summon thee!**
> 
> **By the power of the elements
> I bind thee here and now!
> Never again to be set free
> By any means or any how!**
> 
> **Guardians of the ancient towers,
> Grant me now thy sacred powers!
> Let this spirit never be set free,
> For such is my will, and so mote it be!"**

If you wish to seal the vessel with black candle wax, feel free.
I hope it works for you, as it did for me.

Thank the guardians as you close the circle.

Blessed be.

What would happen to someone if they opened a jar with a demon in it cause my friend is a lot a bit stupid

If your friend is lucky, the spirit/demon returns home. If your friend isn't, anywhere from minor bad luck to full-blown haunting.
