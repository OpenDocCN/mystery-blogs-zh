> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/affirmations-for-healing-affirmations/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/affirmations-for-healing-affirmations/#0001-01-01)

Affirmations only became popular over the last few years, but they’re now hugely celebrated for one simple reason: *they work.* Healing affirmations are especially powerful because they can help to overcome many different afflictions.

These affirmations for healing can apply in so many different cases. Whether you have a physical or mental illness, or you’re simply going through a difficult emotional time, these healing affirmations can quite literally change your reality.

The idea behind affirmations is that our thoughts (and words) create our corporeal world, so after enough repetition, we will start to believe the affirmation which will then change our body chemistry. This is great if you believe in energy work, but for all you science people out there, [the data stands behind affirmations](https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/) as well.

It might feel stupid at first to say an affirmation out loud, but just try it for a week or so and you’ll soon find that it feels *natural and good.*

## How Can You Use These Affirmations For Healing?

There are so many different ways that you can use healing affirmations. Some ideas include printing (or writing) out the affirmation and hanging it in your home, setting it as your iPhone background, sleeping with the affirmation under your pillow, or even just repeating the affirmation a specific amount of times each day.

You can say the affirmation or look at it, but for the best effect, I recommend that you do both. The more you experience the words behind the affirmation, the more powerful the results will be.

**How do you chose which affirmation will be most effective?**

As always, go with your intuition. When you’re reading this list of 101+ healing affirmations, you should browse until you come across an affirmation that just *feels right*. You’ll know when you see it.

If a few different affirmations for healing sit well with you, then you can either work with multiple affirmations or work with one at a time until you achieve your desired results.
