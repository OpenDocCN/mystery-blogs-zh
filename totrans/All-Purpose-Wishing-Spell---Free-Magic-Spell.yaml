    other 2 white candles at the bottom of the star. The 2 colored candles should
    be the middle prongs of the star. Place the plate or offering bowl in the center
    of these, and light the candles clockwise starting from the bottom left candle.

    of water to extinguish it, or drop it on the glass dish and pour salt on top of
    it to put the flame out. Alternately, you can just let it burn out on its own
    if you really want.

    A bowl of water, or an oil diffuser with oil/water for water, incense for air,
    salt or crystals for the earth, and the candles which are fire.

    it outside if you wish. Let the incense and oil diffuser if you started them finish
    burning/diffusing, the candles can be blown out and kept for another spell. The
    salt can be reused or thrown out whichever you prefer. If you would like you can
    meditate on the thought of your wish coming true as the incense and oil diffuser
    finish up.

- en: The first line says to light the candles, but if you have some objection to
    fire, you can use LED candles and it'll work the same. Burning it would release
    the spell, but you could also carry the paper with you. [also, fold the paper
    toward you if you want something to come to you. You're directing the energy]
    Since it also used water, you could rip it and toss it in running water to bring
    your wish to you. Fire is a living element and the fastest energy. Water is a
    steady second, then air and earth. Depending on the wish, you could switch the
    element.
