    yourself. This may work for few, or none. Just have strength, and know your limits.

- en: In this spell you will need to meditate and not ground yourself, for about as
    long as you would need to, to make yourself feel calm and free hearted. Then,
    you must light the white candle at 1:30am and go to bed straight away. Keep your
    mind as blank as possible when falling asleep and going into your own Astral Projection.
    Once you have reached yourself in Astral projection; find your victim that you
    have chosen while they are in their own Astral State. Now when they are in their
    Astral state, go towards their form and push your conscious with force into their
    own. You will be able to use their Astral Projection like it was your own. You
    may find secrets from their conscious, you might even enjoy every second of it.
    But remember, you putting yourself into them then waking up might put a piece
    of yourself into them. I have no clue what happens if you do..just don't do it.
    P.S. Make sure they are deeply asleep when you go to sleep.
