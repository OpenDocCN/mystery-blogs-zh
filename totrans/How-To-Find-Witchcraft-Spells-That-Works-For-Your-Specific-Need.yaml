- en: When you first start out working with your magic, you probably won’t know how
    to craft your own spell. In fact, it can take years to become comfortable coming
    up with witchcraft spells.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it isn’t necessarily difficult to create your own spell since you have
    tons of flexibility, you do need to make sure that your ingredients, method, and
    incantation make sense. Throwing a bunch of random herbs together won’t get you
    any results because generally, specific herbs work for certain purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many new witches use tried and tested spells for this reason. And I have to
    admit, I still use other peoples’ spells from time to time. Though I’ll often
    change a few ingredients or pull inspiration from spells that others have written,
    I find that I at least need to see some recipes in order to get my creative juices
    flowing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The unfortunate thing is that it’s hard to know when a spell is just gibberish
    (or something the author threw together in order to sell the book without actually
    testing it) versus when a spell is legit. You don’t want to put a ton of time
    and effort into a spell only to realize that the recipe was wrong in the first
    place!

- en: I’ve gotten a lot of questions about witchcraft spells and how to source them,
    so today I’m writing this post so that you’ll hopefully have a good idea of *where*
    to look for spells and *how* to know which witchcraft spells are legit.

    thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    It also means that you’re able to double check the ingredients in a spell to figure
    out if it’s legit.
  prefs: []

    working on a type of spell you’ve never done before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I recently became interested in justice/court related spells. I’ve
    worked quite a bit with money spells, love spells, luck spells, and protection
    spells, but the area of justice is new to me. I had to spend a *lot* of time researching
    herbs, colors, and associations before I was able to judge which spells could
    be effective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    an ancestor. Spells were tried and true because they came from people we trusted.
  prefs: []

    tons of online resources in hopes of finding a bit of knowledge.

    will work. You may need *some* experience to truly be able to decipher the validity
    of a spell, but reading through this list is a good place to start.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Witchcraft isn’t as simple as snapping your fingers. Over time, certain ingredients
    and techniques have been combined to create witchcraft because these tools and
    techniques actually work energetically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any legit spell should use real ingredients. That means you’re working with
    herbs, crystals, candles, string, poppets, jars, etc. Of course, you can definitely
    substitute things, but make sure that most of the ingredients you’re using have *energy*.
    A spell based only on synthetic ingredients just won’t work that well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, the techniques of any spell should be well-established. Jar spells,
    candle spells, and many other types of witchcraft spells have been practiced and
    honed for centuries.
  prefs: []

    easy. Chances are, it won’t work.

- en: 3\. The Techniques & Ingredients Align With Your Purpose
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can’t just throw together any ingredients and expect your spell to work.
    Your ingredients have to be specific to your purpose. For example, lavender works
    well for a self-love spell, but it might not work for a fiery motivation spell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you find a spell that you like, do a bit of research to make sure all of
    the ingredients have the right associations for your purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, make sure that the techniques fit in with the energy of your spell.
    Candle spells work well for quick, potent magic, while jar spells take longer
    but hold up better over time. If you need something done quickly, a jar spell
    might not do the trick.

    all of the spells on these sites will be good. It’s impossible to find any one
    site filled with incredible spells!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I typically start on Tumblr when I’m first researching a spell. I haven’t used
    Tumblr since I was in middle school for anything else, but I do think it’s a good
    resource if you’re brainstorming about anything spiritual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I’ll type in “*luck spell”* and browse through the results. Sometimes,
    I find a full spell that works for me, while other times I simply start here to
    get into the mentality of my spell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and research those associations for my specific type of spell.
  prefs: []

    spell, jar spell, etc.) and what verbiage I want to use.

    the spell, but I will use bits and pieces from each spell to craft my own.

    great! Remember to use the list above in order to cross-reference a spell before
    dumping hours of work in.

    relating to spell work) but I’ve also found some great inspiration for spells.
    Sometimes, I’ll read a question about a spell that I never even considered casting.
    Reddit is a great place to brainstorm and come up with totally new ideas.

    incantations. Say you already have your spell set (ingredients, techniques, etc.)
    but don’t have the specific words that you need to say. Pinterest is a great place
    to browse and find wording that you can use or alter as needed!

    or general witchcraft knowledge, the Reels section does have a few legit spells.
    I like how you can vet witches on Instagram more easily than you can on TikTok.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re interested in seeing spells visually, head to the Reels section and
    search for spells in general or a specific type of spell. Again, I recommend this
    more as research and less as a copy-and-paste activity.

    In fact, the authors probably didn’t try every spell because they simply wanted
    to sell a book!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There *are* a few gems, but they tend to be either older books or books written
    by reputable witches who are experienced in one specific area. Sometimes, anthologies
    are written by a group of witches so they can offer various spells, but again
    you need to make sure that you vet these witchcraft spells before diving in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will say that while I use online resources for research, I cast from book
    spells much more often. I find that these spells are well thought out and that
    the ingredients match my purpose, while witchcraft spells found online often cut
    corners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would *definitely* recommend that you get a few large anthologies. These are
    basically spell dictionaries that will have tons and tons of spells for just about
    any purpose. You’ll be able to sort through and modify these spells as you go.

    be able to substitute. Look up similar ingredients that function in a similar
    way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you will want to substitute herbs for other herbs that have the
    same properties, keeping in mind how they may function. I will often substitute
    black pepper for cayenne pepper, but cayenne pepper will *definitely* give the
    spell a stronger kick, so I try to stay aware of that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about the *energy* of the thing you’re substituting and try to see how
    different it is from the original ingredient. If the energy doesn’t bother you
    and the substituted ingredient is still traditionally known to help for your purpose,
    go for it!
  prefs: []

    can easily be bought at a local grocery store, but others are harder to come by.

    candles, and just about everything else) on Etsy.](https://rstyle.me/+S-HzmHdIoJoMlDn694R19w)

    and feel that the energy is better coming from a seller instead of a large, corporate
    site.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Local metaphysical shops are a great resource but not all of us live in areas
    where these shops are readily available, so I would definitely be prepared to
    shop online if need be.
