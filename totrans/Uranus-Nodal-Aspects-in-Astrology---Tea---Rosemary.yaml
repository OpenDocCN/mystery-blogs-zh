- en: Uranus is one of the most misunderstood planets in astrology due to its dynamic
    nature. It doesn’t mean *one thing* the way that the other planets do, instead
    it has a vast interpretation ability and may mean something different for every
    person.

    chart can be difficult because the question becomes: “what is unexpected about
    us?”'

- en: Typically, Uranus can be understood as the area of life that we want to rebel
    in. This may come as just being *different* from our peers in some way. It may
    also indicate something *misunderstood *about us– people from the outside simply
    don’t understand why we are this way.

    energy as well. These differences may come in the form of brilliance, inventions,
    science, technology, sudden changes, freedom, independence, or originality. You’ll
    notice many of these are keywords we use to describe Aquarius as well.

    important to the persons life path than it would have been otherwise. In fact
    Uranus *is *your life path– being different and rebelling from the norm is the
    thing that you are supposed to do in this life.

    households, where morals are imposed on them by some kind of authority. This innately

    out their own morals and go their own way in life, but this is not always allowed.'

    truth. These people may even lose touch with reality, or become nervous and sensitive
    to others opinions of them.
