*There has been a lot of candle magic books in the market, but I would say this one is my favorite. It has a beautiful cover of course, and illustrations that are not just decorative but also actually useful.*

I have personal aversion towards " pretty books" that show very little in depth knowledge and I was suspecting this one will be the case, but I am happy I was wrong. On the contrary, this book is right up to my alleyway - no meaningless fluff, just practical, realistic guidance, written by

The Book of Candle Magic by Madame Pamita : Book Review

someone who actually did the stuff they are talking about. It is definitely modern eclectic spin on classical candle magic with a few fascinating crossovers with sigil magic, magical squares and so on, which are very effective combinations, that offer a great range of flexibility to the spell-caster and would surely deserve a book on their own.

Even-tough it is very to the point and direct writing, this is not just a recipe book of spells (another thing I quite dislike) but step-by-step guide with useful illustrations and diagrams, that are easy to read and understand even for somebody who has never done a candle spell before. Madame Pamita also includes a whole chapter on candle wax reading, which I believe is very important skills for instant evaluation of the spell direction and results, saving yourself potentially years to see how the spell turned out, most books on the topic, don't include information about divination methods, so I was happy to see this one does.

This is very comprehensive book, that goes in-depth but its not confusing. I would recommend with clear conscious to anyone interested in candle magic!
