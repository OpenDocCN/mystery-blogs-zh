    appear as apparitions, or one may only feel their presence.

    have to join you. If they desire, either by their own wish or because they want
    something (like an offering of an object you have), to join you, they will. However,
    this spell will not force them to come to you.

    of the spell, it might help you connect with darker spirits and energies, or might
    help you in a seance or something like that.
