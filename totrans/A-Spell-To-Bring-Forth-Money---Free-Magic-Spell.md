## Casting Instructions for 'A Spell To Bring Forth Money'

Meditate for about ten minutes. This is optional, but recommended.
Now, sit on the ground (inside). Place two jars or cups in front of you. Put the blue and green candle(s) in the middle of the jars, and either place the other candles behind the jars or circle it.

Place the following in the first jar to the left, in this order;

-Add rain water (or water) letting it cover the bottom of the cup or jar.
-Add a drop of honey
-add one eyelash of yours
-Drop the coin (If you have a quarter, that one is better.)
-Drop the leaves (optional)
-Now, on a small paper (About the size of one inch both width and length) write the words ''Bring me Money'' and on the other side, write how much money you want (optional). Try to keep it small. Do not put one million dollars or something really big or it will not work. The amount of money also depends on your age, and if you have a job. If you are a kid or teen with no job, out something that your mom or dad would give you (say, 20 dollars or 100 dollars) for going to the mall, etc.
-Add a drop of your blood on the paper
-Drop the paper in the jar.
Put your mouth to the jar but DO NOT CONSUME, and chant 3 times;

''Money, Money, Come to me,
Bring me what I want to see,
Purify,
Energy,
Goodness for all,
this is my will,
so mote it be.''

Now, place the jar back down, and put a lid on it. If you do not have a lid, place plastic wrap or tin foil over it, and seal it by a pony tail holder or rubber band or string.

Now, fill the second jar to the right with rain water (or water) enough to cover the bottom.
Drop lavender leaves, or spray lavender spray three times.
Take a small paper (1 inch width x length) and draw the Gibu Auja Symbol in blood. If you don't know what that symbol looks like, heres a link. And if the link doesn't show, google it.

Now, drop the paper in the jar and put your mouth to the jar but DO NOT CONSUME and chant three times;
''Luck,
Protection,
Come to me,
This is my will,
So mote it be''
Place jar back down. If you don't have a lid, use tin foil or plastic wrap.
Now, focus on your energy, the candle's flame and the two jar/cups in front of you. Imagine the outcome, (this could be you getting your pay check at work, getting a raise, or your mom or dad giving you money)
Then, blow the candles out.

Place the jars in a dark, concealed place. (closet, cabinet, under your bed, etc.)

After you get your money, or if you start to get bad luck or any negative consequences, rinse the jar out immediately, and dispose of the paper.

This spell was newly made, and for best results, perform a enhancer spell, or ''how to make a spell'' spell. Here is the link

Even though the spell is titled ''how to make a spell'' it can also be used to enhance another spell.

If the link doesn't show, or if you have questions, or if the spell worked or didn't work, please mail me. I would love to hear everyone's results :)

Good luck, -ToxxicWishes.

Can I co it without the candles, I cant afford to buy them

You can edit any spell to suit your needs.

Can I use pipe water in case it doesn't rain

Is this mind over matter. I believe as children of he ceator we have the right to all things. So is the spell and intention based on faith and no works or do I have to work for it, say like money?
