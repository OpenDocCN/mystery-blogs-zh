- en: Now take your item you chose or made...and connect it with the string, the string
    has to be able to stand straight from the top not sideways, tie the knot tight
    so it dosn't slide. Now find it's yes and no position. You can also hold it in
    your hand and charge it, or set in the windowsill in the sunlight or moonlight.
    Put in salt to cleanse it but some things shouldn't be put in saltwater so if
    that's the case just put in salt or dirt. I advise you enchant it with the elements,
    example put it through incense for air, dip it in water for well water and in
    dirt or sand for earth or put it on leaves...like when you make runes. It you
    have and item that shouldn't be in water then get a little bit of water and dry
    it off or put it above steam. I hope this was helpful and enjoy your pendulum.

- en: Now to use a pendulum after you make it you simply hold it correctly by putting
    the string between your index finger and your thumb then relax your hand downwards
    or look at a picture of how it's done(I have one in my album, my album is public)
    now either think the questions in your head or say them aloud but before questions
    ask it "what's your yes position" mine personally spins clockwise or counter clockwise
    for yes and back and forth or side to side for no, then you must ask "what's your
    no position". For beginners don't worry about maybe positions yet. Now after you
    ask a question ask "is this accurate" and give it a little time to shift to yes
    or no. Sometimes I start off with "are my eyes brown" which is yes then "are my
    eyes green" which is no. Now if your pendulum dosn't move give it a nudge it will
    still awnser questions you don't know the awnser to correctly.
