 Look at the window and think of words to describe the moon then light the candle infront of you in the moon light. Chant; "Give me a enchanted life of immortals, the undead."

Stare into the flame and focus of nothing but it, then chant, "Powers of thy undead rise, pull yourself across these skies. Bring me a vampire life soon, as this candle light crosses the moon".

Then prick your finger with the needle and pour 1 drop of blood onto the flame, do more until the flame goes out. Then think of your self with ruby red eyes fangs with blood dripping from them. if you wont hunt humans, but animals then imagine gold eyes.

Chant: "Take my mortality and make me feed on blood and live in the night. I shall be able to (name power) then sleep in the morning". You should awake seeing yourself with ruby eyes, mortals shall not be able to see it though.

You cannot become a vampire.

Then how can you become a vampire

you can't. vampires aren't physically real. magick is a neutral energy that only effects energy to bring a desired changed. it doesn't contradict nature because it's a part of nature, ruled by nature, and since humans cannot naturally transform, and vampires aren't physical beings [they're astral beings like spirits or fae] no spell will let you physically transform because it would contradict nature.
