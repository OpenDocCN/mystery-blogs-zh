- en: Have you ever walked into a room in your home and just gotten very creeped out?
    Or were doing something in a room and felt bad feelings and like you were being
    watched? This spell will help with that.

- en: The spell is very simple, yet extremely powerful. I used it to get rid of the
    negative energy in my home.

- en: Begin by lighting the candle, it can be any color but black would work the best.
    Take the candle into the room, keep the lights off and only let the candle light
    the room.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Begin walking throughout the room. I don't believe in memorizing and chant for
    banishing. Its best if you use your own words so you have more power.
  prefs: []

- en: Tell the energy in the room that is not positive that it must leave the room,
    the house, and the area. Be sure to tell the bad energy that the candle's flame
    will suck it into the fire, and remove it.

- en: Say as many things as you like, but keep your cool. The evil spirits may try
    to frighten you. But they cannot touch you as long as you stay strong and keep
    the candle lit.

- en: As soon as you covered the room, tell the spirits and energy that it isn't welcome,
    and as soon as you blow out the candle, it will be removed and never can return.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Leave the room and blow out the candle. Don't enter the room until at least
    15 minutes. Then all that bad feelings and such will be gone.
