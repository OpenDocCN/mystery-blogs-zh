I love this spell, I hope it works.

Please use this wisely. I have practiced a separate mantram (one for health reasons) and it worked EXCEPTIONALLY well. I was so healthy that my vitals read that I was sick. But my point is that this could work all too well.

Can I get the one u did for your health reasons

What about pronouncing the wirds correctly?

Wow you have to chant this 3 times a day,108 times at dawn, noon and evening everyday till one month only...?

A mantra can help you bring a specific energy or desire into your life. Chanting a phrase can bring you into a trance or self hypnosis. If you are saying ''bring me love'' every day at the same time, you are telling the universe what you want and charging your energy to attract someone who will be a suitable partner. They will still have free will and you will still need to talk to them, but it is possible. However, if this spell is claiming you chant something like ''please love me'' alone in your room and that will hypnotize a specific person to blindly obey, no. If you were focusing on a picture of the person and including their name, this might cast a spell on them, but it would not be hypnosis. And furthermore, you should not force someone to love you. No solid love began with a kidnapping, and that is what you are attempting with this chant.

How can we do that? What about school?

Do it before school by waking up early. Everything is possible if you want to achieve it.

How in the heck can I say all this. Can someone help me pronounce these words?
