- en: This spell uses candle magic and an appeal to the Elements. One aspect needs
    to be noted. Black candles were once associated with Black Magic and malevolence
    but today are much more used to represent loss, sadness, discord and negativity.

    closest to you. Clear your mind of everything except what you are doing. Light
    the white candle, being aware of its symbolism and say the following: "Earth,
    Fire, Wind, Water and Spirit; I ask thee to cleanse my body of all negative energies".'

    words above and pause to let the energies come to a natural balance. Light the
    green candle and again repeat the above words. Sit back, keep your mind clear
    and be peaceful for at least 10 minutes.

    to burn right down so that you are filled with healing energy. You should feel
    rested and relaxed and more ready to tackle problems as they arise. Make this
    part of your weekly routine till you feel it no longer to be necessary.

    Try it for yourself and see if you like this method more.
