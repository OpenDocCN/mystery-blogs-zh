- en: A Witches Ladder is comprised of 3 lengths of material braided together, adding
    3 feathers every 3 inches while chanting. The Witches Ladder is one of the most
    versatile spells ever discovered because there is no specific requirements as
    far as colors, gems, anything. You need only the strings and feathers, and you
    can work for anything.
