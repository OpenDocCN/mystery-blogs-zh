- en: Before casting a spell, Wiccans often create a sacred space to connect with
    the divine and to raise their energy. This can be achieved through the casting
    of a circle, a symbolic boundary that separates the mundane world from the magical
    realm. The circle can be marked physically with stones, or visualized in your
    mind’s eye. Within this sacred space, you are free to work your magic with focused
    intent.
