- en: A worry stone, sometimes called a palm stone depending on the size, is a **smooth
    stone with a thumb-sized indentation** in the middle. They are often round or
    oval in shape for easier handling. These stones are easy to carry with you wherever
    you go, perfect to pick out of your pocket when you need to take a minute and
    de-stress.

- en: It is possible that these small, smooth stones have been used in many cultures
    across the world in times of stress. Their origins are often credited to [Ancient
    Greece](https://spells8.com/greek-deities-devotionals/) in the form of palm stones,
    but it is not hard to imagine that many cultures had similar practices. Keep reading
    to learn how you can benefit from the use of worry stones in your magickal practice.

- en: There are many different materials that a worry stone can be made from. These
    include natural stones, crystals and gems, clay, and even glass. The material
    used, or found, may even **play a role in how you can use the worry stone** in
    your magickal practice. In most cases, it is common to find worry stones made
    of natural materials. Plastic is not generally used as it is not considered natural.

    erosion, usually by a natural body of water. You may find smooth stones while
    walking through a river or along the beach. The next time you are walking along
    a body of water, keep an eye out for a worry stone perfect for you! These particular
    stones may have the added benefit of being connected to both the element of Water
    and Earth.'

    tumbled, though some may be rough cuts with a smooth surface. These particular
    worry stones would need to be made from skin safe, non-porous, and solid stones.
    Sorry, that rough piece of selenite you have is not a good candidate for a worry
    stone! As natural pieces of the earth, worry stones made from crystals or other
    gemstones are natural connections with the element of Earth.

    that’s right! **Glass can also be used as a worry stone.** In this case, the glass
    would not be sharp so as not to cut yourself while using it. Do you know how glass
    is made? Glass is made by heating up sand to very high temperatures. Worry stones
    made from glass may have the added benefit of being connected to both the element
    of Earth and Fire.

    would be baked clay, though any sort of solid material would work. The material
    you use to make your clay would lend itself to the connections it has with the
    element. If you use baked clay, it may have the added connection to the element
    of Fire. If you use air dry clay, it may have the added connection of the element
    of Earth. Keep reading for a recipe to make your own!

- en: Worry stones are used as a [grounding](https://spells8.com/lessons/grounding-mindfulness/)
    tool to help those who may have anxiety, depression, or a general feeling of worry.
    The small indentation on the smooth stone, if there is one at all, is the perfect
    size for a thumb or finger. When using a worry stone, you would rub the smooth
    surface of the stone with your finger while being mindful of the sensation. You
    may even perform a [small meditation](https://spells8.com/%e2%96%b6%ef%b8%8f-witch-music-full-moon-meditation/),
    practicing keeping the mind focused on one simple movement to calm the nerves.
    This is a wonderfully simple grounding technique for the busy mind.

    we give it during the ritual. You may want to consecrate your worry stones for
