    protecting you from negative energy. It worked very well on me. Best for rituals
    and casting spells!

    is where it is preferred you have sage incense. I''m not sure if it works with
    any other sent, but sage is the incense I have on my altar) Pass your piece through
    the smoke and say: By the elemental power of air. Lastly, go to your candle and

    do take it off, your magickal power will go back down to it's original state and
    you will no longer be protected. Put it back on to amp up your power and protect
    yourself again.
