- en: Simple practice. Should work for some. You can also hold objects like crystals,
    herbs, or personal objects like a teddy bear or phone. Sit and feel the energy
    within the object, try to connect with who owns the object if it is of sentimental
    value. You can also place you hand on a tree and feel the pulse of energy. Personally,
    I would work on psi balls and feeling the energy flowing in your own body before
    sensing the energy in a room as it might be difficult for newbies.
