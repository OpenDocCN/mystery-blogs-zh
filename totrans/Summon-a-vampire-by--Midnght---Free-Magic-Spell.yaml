  prefs: []

    This spell is fake and real magic does not work like this, it's as simple as that.

- en: Are you referring to my comment? I was critiquing the spell, not the person
    who wrote it. Contrary to popular belief, I have no qualms with anyone who posts
    a spell on this site... Possible exception being BellaSullin, but she left the
    site.

    is a simple solution. **Ignore it.** That is all. You can ignore the comment section.
    If you see a profile picture or name you do not agree with, you do not read their
    comment. It is as simple as that. My comments are designed to educate. Yes, I
    am blunt in the fantasy section because there is far more outright lies than truths.
    If a spell is in the realm of possibility, I will give it more insight. But this
    is fake, so I will not waste my time on an explanation unless asked for one.

    we were are new once. If you would permit me to convey some advice, be willing
    to grow in your beliefs. Your faith is weak if a simple *no* is enough to make
    you question your convictions. However, you should also know when to let a belief
    go. If you are presented with enough genuine evidence, you should not cling to
    something because it is familiar. If you have not already created your Book of
    Shadows, or Grimoire, I suggest you do so. This will be your Magikal journal where
    you can record and reflect on your craft. If you do not wish to listen to those
    who tell you a spell does not work, try it. If it sounds safe, go for it. Be sure
    to record how you felt before the spell. Immediately after casting, record how
    you felt during the spell. Lastly, keep your Book of Shadows with you for a full
    lunar month and record anything and everything you notice that you feel pertained
    to the spell.

    you. I am not insulting anyone. If you are hurt by a simple *you cannot do this*
    then it is a sign you have an ego wound and you need to do shadow work to address
    it. The reason I and many others post these type of *negative* comments are to
    save new members time and know which spells to try. Ultimately, it is up to you
    whether you listen or not. I genuinely do not care either way. I am simply the
    person saying *you do not want to take that path, it is bumpy.*
