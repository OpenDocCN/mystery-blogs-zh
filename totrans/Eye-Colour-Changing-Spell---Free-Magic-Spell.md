 ## Casting Instructions for 'Eye-Colour Changing Spell'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A pentacle (can be drawn on paper)

*   1 candle the colour you want your eyes

*   Lighter/matches/other means of fire

*   1 mirror

Place the candle of your desired eye colour on the pentacle. Light it with whatever means you feel necessary. Take a deep breath through your nose and out through your mouth, with your eyes closed. While you do that, visualise your face with your eyes as they are now. Open your eyes and chant thrice:

''One, two, three, eyes change for me,
One, two, three, [colour now] to [colour desired] I see.''

Visualise your eyes changing while breathing as above. Do that twice, then chant thrice:

''By the power of three, so mote it be.''

Check your eyes in the mirror. They should have changed. When you wish, you may either use my reversal spell (just go to my profile and click History), or get a candle of your previous eye colour and do the above spell.
