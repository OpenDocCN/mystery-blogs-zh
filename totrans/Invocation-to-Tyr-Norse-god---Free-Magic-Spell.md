 ## Casting Instructions for 'Invocation to Tyr Norse god'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:**Honor is not all that comfortable. It demands all you have. All you are, all you can do. It's wraps you like a chain. That you shuffle where others run. Yet that chain will bear you up. When others trip and fall. It limits you, like the loss of a limb; you reach, and fall ever short, brought up by honor's limitation. And yet the limiting hones you sharper. Like a tool that must be ground down to work. As ever sharpening moves some of you. O lord of honor, whose name invokes, seals bargin without a thought of cheating. You whose word is law and law is will, you who are never afraid. To do what needs to be done. Even when there is no question. That there will be great loss. May we have half the steel that lies within you. O warrior one-handed in your spine in your hand in your soul.
