Sacred stones, crystals and metals have fascinated humans for aeons. Their beauty hypnotizes; their diversity electrifies. As we became more curious about our world, gems were certainly on the list of things people wanted to know more about. Mages, mystics and Medicine Men all sought out the spirit of a stone and its capabilities. Modern correspondence lists are filled with information on what they discovered. The fun part is putting all those energetic attributes to work in our magic.

## Uses for Crystals, Gems and Minerals in Wicca and Magic

Witches, Wiccans, Druids, Seers and many other awakened humans use sacred stones regularly for a variety of purposes including money magic (prosperity, abundance). One might be charged with keen-mindedness so you do better on your job before asking for a raise. Another could be saturated with calming energy so you can really focus on successful approaches for improving cash flow. In these examples, there is no one particular stone that is a MUST. Like any other component in magic, what a crystal means to you matters in how you apply it.

Besides staying aware of a stone’s voice when looking for crystals, you need two other pieces of information notable for your [**Book of Shadows**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/book-of-shadows/witchs-book-shadow/) for using your new tool. One would be the many ways you can add them to magical practices. The second is which stones have natural energy dynamics for prosperity, wealth and abundance.

**13 Applications for Crystals in Magic and Witchcraft**

**1.** Carrying or wearing an energized stone with you throughout the day, especially if you are shopping or paying the bills. Use it as a literal touchstone before making decisions.
**2.** Sleeping with your crystal. The purpose here is encouraging insightful [**dreams**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witch/dream-interpretation-for-wiccans-witches-and-pagans/) about financial situations and opportunities on the horizon. Hint: Make notes of what you see in this dream so you can refer to them later for insight.
**3.** Making a [**gem elixir**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/magic-wiccan-potions/witches-brews-magic-potions-elixirs-and-tinctures/). Wash the stone well then add it to spring water. Let it sit in the water for four minutes (four is the “money” number in [**Numerology**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witch/the-magic-of-numerology-numbers-with-their-symbolism-and-meaning/)). Remove the stone and drink the water as a way of internalizing that energy for that power presentation or any other expression that can improve your business prospects.
[wisew_rectangle_large align=”left”]**4.** Keep the stone in the area where you do most of the work with your money. Where do you work on the budget or balance your check book? That’s a perfect location. Just set it with intention and let the crystal work its wonders.
**5.** Place it with other components you use for [**money spells**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/money-spells/40-money-spells/). This way all those ingredients charge each other!
**6.** Move the crystal over specific Chakras to get them back in balance. For example, when you’re afraid of being broke scan your Root Chakra. If you’re irresponsible with spending, focus on the Sacral Chakra and if you gift too much of your money to others (or loan it) that’s your Heart Chakra.
**7.** Substitute crystal points for a magic wand in your spells. Point the crystal in the direction you’re sending your money-oriented energies. Or point it at yourself since you want the money coming your way.
**8.** Burying energized crystals around your home. This not only keeps prosperity vibes humming but can also work as a foundation for casting sacred space.
**9.** Place them on your altar as a gift for or veneration of specific Deities with whom you work when money gets tight (or just to say thanks!).
**10.** Decorate a change box or bottle with suitable crystals so money grows.
**11.** Create charms that attract providence, amulets that turn away the poverty pox, and talismans that improve your awareness of positive possibilities when you hear them in conversation or in a moment of inspiration.
**12.** Use them in pendulum divination (points) when you have binary questions about your financial situation.
**13.** Try [**scrying**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/scrying/scrying-divination-magical-crystals-basics/) with a crystal, keeping the question about your prospects and needs in mind. Consider making notes of your experience in your Book of Shadows
