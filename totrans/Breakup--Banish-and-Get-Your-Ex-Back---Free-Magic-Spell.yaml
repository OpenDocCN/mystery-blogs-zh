- en: If you want your ex back but they're with a new partner, try this simple, but
    really powerful spell. It breaks up the relationship, banishes the other wo/man,
    and brings your ex to you if done correctly. This has really worked well for me.
    Bue beware of free will however! This spell works best if there's some feelings
    between you and your ex. But again, If you concentrate, this spell will still
    remove the other wo/man from the picture and banish them.

    (for example, tomorrow you will replace "by the 7th day" with "by the 6th day".
    then "5th day", "4th day", "3rd day", "2nd" or "next day" and "by today" for the

- en: If your target is responsible for your breakup and you want revenge on top of
    it, then do this in the restroom and write their first and last name on a piece
    of toilet paper, then do the spell. Afterward wipe feces on the toilet paper and
    say "you're s#*t! You're life is s#*t!", and flush it down the toilet. Not only
    have you broken them up, and banished her/him, but you've also turned his/her
    life upside down. If you go more then once a day, then you can do this spell multiple
    times during the day too.
