**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 white candle

One week prior to ovulation, Mom-to-be should increase her consumption of citrus/acidic foods (tomatoes, oranges, lemons, etc), nuts and leafy greens like kale or spinach. Avoid greasy or oily meats (sausages, pepperoni, pork). If you aren't already, consider taking a folic acid supplement.

The day before your most fertile day, the actual day, and the day after, place three new candles of equal size (1 blue, 1 pink, 1 white) near the bed.

The father-to-be should light the blue candle and say the following:

''Divine Father, We call thee El, Priapus, Ing, Min and Cernunnos,

You, whose sheltering arms shield and comfort your young,

Whose power is seen in the mighty river, the nourishing Sun,

Bless this union of man and mate.

The mother-to-be should light the pink candle and say the following:

''Divine Mother, We call thee Inanna, Asherah, Freya, Vesta and Hathor

You, who bear, nurture, and defend your young against all dangers,

Whose power is seen in the fertile fields, the moonlit breezes,

Bless this union of woman and mate.

Together, you both should light the third candle and together repeat the following:

''Lord and Lady, Mother and Father, Life Divine.

As two are made one, we seek your sacred blessing,

Gift us with a healthy child,

One who embodies the best of us both.

Imagine a warm light filling the room as you make love. Let the candles burn until they go out on their own. Repeat with new candles for each of the remaining nights.
