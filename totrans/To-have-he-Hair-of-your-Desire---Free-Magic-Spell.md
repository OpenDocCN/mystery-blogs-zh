Does this work

no you can't change your hair with magick it is apart of your dna genes

@Midoriya you don't belive

Midoriya is sort of correct. If you're dreaming of long pink hair to grow naturally from your head, no, this spell won't work. However, if you're hoping your hair will grow longer faster, then that's in the realm of possibility, but it won't be an instant thing. You might see an extra inch or two over the span of a month, but that's about it.
