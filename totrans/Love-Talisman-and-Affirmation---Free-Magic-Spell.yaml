- en: '**Love Spell** During a full or waxing moon raise energy with breath meditation,
    chanting, or another method you prefer. Obtain some apple seeds, vervain, rose
    petals, loveage, and cinnamon.  (All are not required, and you may substitute
    in other fragrant love herbs.)  Mix the herbs during a waxing moon and ask the
    powers around you to empower and bless your blend. You may call on your patron
    deity for assistance at this time. As you mix the herbs, visualize your energy
    mixing with the herbs. Place some of the herbs into a 9 x9 inch square cloth or
    pouch make the talisman. There should be enough herbs in the sachet so it has
    a pleasant fragrance. Red and pink are good colors for the cloth as they represent
    love. Next add a love symbol such as a heart charm or a copper coin with the symbol
    of Venus carved in it. Better if it was minted in your birth year. Also add the
    piece of rose quartz. Tie the bundle closed with red, pink, or white string with
    3 with times around and 3 knots.  Let it sit in the light of the moon to absorb
    energy. Full moon is best for this.  In a fireproof bowl or cauldron, burn the
    remaining herbs and fervently chant the following: Lasting love and happiness
    start as love for me fills his heart. Let his desire burn like a fire. Then we
    shall be together joyfully. So mote it be! (substitute her for his when applicable)
    This works better if you have the words memorized. The exact words aren''t important,
    so if you would rather use a love poem you wrote, that''s fine so long as it clearly
    expresses your will using affirmative words. The herbs should be dry beforehand
    and you may need to use some alcohol or charcoal lighter fluid to help them burn.
    Exercise appropriate safety and keep away anything else flammable, use a small
    amount of fuel, and this is best done outisde away from dry leaves. While doing
    so, visualize being with a romantic partner. Write an affirmation on the pink
    paper stating "I will soon be intimate with a man / lady who..." Then describe
    his or her desired qualities using positive statements. Refrain from using negative
    words like "not" or "without" in your affirmation. Draw a heart or another love
    symbol in red ink on the other side and scent the paper with rosewater or your
    favorite perfume. Spend some time meditating on being with a an ideal lover. Visualize
    romantic outings together and concentrate intensely on your emotions and the idea
    of having a romantic partner. This step is important since directing your energy
    is the core of the spell. After this is done, release any energy by grounding.
    Do this by hitting the ground with both hands and visualize energy flowing into
    the earth. You can add energy to the spell at any time by reading your affirmation
    and visualizing being with an ideal lover; do this daily if possible. In order
    for the spell to manifest, you must give it the opportunity to. Seek out social
    venues and socialize as much as possible with a positive attitude. Carry the talisman
    and affirmation with you to attract a soulmate. Don''t tell others about the spell
    as their disbelief or jealous intentions may prevent it from manifesting. If you
    don''t have some of the mentioned substances, substitute with them what feels
    appropriate for expressing love. Rose petals are powerful in love magic, and the
    more ways you can incorporate them into your ritual the better.  For added effect,
    this spell can be performed during a full moon or on Beltaine (April 30th).'
