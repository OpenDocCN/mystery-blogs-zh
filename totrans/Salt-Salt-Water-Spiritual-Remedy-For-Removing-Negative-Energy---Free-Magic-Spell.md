 **Salt Salt Water Spiritual Remedy  For Removing Negative Energy**

Ghosts from the subtle (spiritual) realm leave black energy on a majority of beings including humans that can create a variety of problems such as depression, unclear thinking or malfunction of an organ which lead to even further difficulties such as addiction, financial problems or chest pain respectively.
It is difficult to get rid of this black energy except through a generalised spiritual remedy such as spiritual practice or a more specific one like the salt water remedy.
This spell, if done correctly, will ease the caster of lethargy, reduction of promptness, the inability to think, excessive thinking (particularly negative thinking); anger, stress, physical illness, and a lot more. A recommendation for anyone.
The salt water remedy is a simple but powerful spiritual remedy to counteract the harmful unseen black energy and drain it out of our system. By doing so, we do not waste our spiritual practice in counteracting black energy. Instead it can be used to bring about our spiritual growth.

This spell was borrowed from the Spiritual Research Foundation's website and I thank the website for creating this method.)

*   Water filled in the bucket (up to 50%) to cover the ankles when the feet are immersed in the bucket

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   1 large bucket

*   Water filled in the bucket (up to 50%) to cover the ankles when the feet are immersed in the bucket

*   Rock salt (though table salt or sea salt can be used at the cost of less effectiveness)

*   1 towel

*   1 foot mat

Preparation

Fill a bucket (up to 50%) with water so as to cover the ankles. Add 2 tablespoons of rock salt.

Pray to God sincerely and with faith to remove the black energy in you. Also pray specifically for destroying the black energy of the ghosts (demons, devils, negative energies, etc.) affecting you. Prayer is an important ingredient which enhances the effectiveness of this remedy.

The remedy

Sit upright with your feet immersed in the salt water. Keep a distance of at least 2-3 cms between the feet. This aids in the maximum discharge of black energy. If the feet touch each other, then there is obstacle to the discharge of black energy through the feet.

Keep the feet in the salt water for 10  15 minutes.

While the feet are immersed, chant the Name of God according to your religion.

On completion

After the completion of the remedy give gratitude to God and pray for the creation of a protective sheath around you.

Then throw the salt water in the toilet and rinse the bucket with fresh water.

Chant the Name of God according to your religion for 2-3 minutes.

In cases of severe distress, the salt water remedy can be repeated 2-3 times in a day at 2-3 hour intervals for better results.

This can work, but I take issue with a number of points in the spell. Negative energy can be due to malevolent spirits, but it could also be the result of daily life. Someone cuts you off in traffic, says something cruel, or you get angry, a little bit of negative energy sticks to you. Regular grounding, shielding, and cleansing will keep things in check. This does work, but you could also add it to a bath with a few herbs, soak in the tub, and do the same thing. You also do not need to pray to a deity if you do not work with one. Visualize the negative energy slipping off you into the water as you soak and if you wish to say a chant, you can easily state your intention ''cleansing waters take away, negative energy begone today.'' Heck, it doesn't even need to rhyme, just chant ''cleanse'' if you need to say something to focus. When you feel lighter, and the negative feelings are gone, get out of the tub, pull the plug, and the water will take the negative energy away.
