  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may have an idea about how things are supposed to be that may not line up
    with how reality it. Remember that with Magic, you are manifesting a reality that
    is not separate from the reality we are living in. In other words, you want your
    work to actually happen. This is why it's good to be aware of how natural and
    universal laws work, as this can be applied to your spell and manifestation work
    for results that are realistic.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically, if you do a certain spell or set a certain intention, it can take
    time for it to come into your life, and sometimes this doesn't mean today, tomorrow,
    or even next week, sometimes it can take longer based on various factors, but,
    with patience, eventually the things you want will come.

    manifesting.

    internal or external. The more you're able to do this, the easier you'll be able
    to overcome situations and draw things in your life that you want.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you may think the solution requires a certain approach, but through
    experimentation, you may find that something else works better for you. **Keep
    experimenting** and finding different ways that work and that get you closer to
    what you want. This can also man incorporating different ideas but in a practical
    way. If you can take an idea and apply it practically, this becomes a practical
    technique too.

- en: Manifestation Magic can certainly help get the ball rolling, but it's also important
    that you work to be active in whatever it is related to what you want. And this
    can include putting yourself in different situations to increase your chances
    for a better outcome.

    to manifest things. It's a skill that can be built up like any other skill and
    that can improve with practice over time and through understanding how universal
    laws work in accordance with the outcome of your spell work.

- en: Sometimes you think an idea is good in theory, but it may not be the right time
    or the best thing in practice, and so, you may subconsciously resist the results
    that you want without realizing it or the energy of what you want may not line
    up with what you currently want to manifest. Keep meditating and contemplating
    on what you want and allowing the true energy to become more apparent so you can
    line up with it.

  prefs:

    manifest it into your life.

- en: Desire is really important when manifesting. Without it, it's possible that
    something may not come to full fruition. Sometimes you may want something, but
    it's not as urgent, so you might not put as much effort into it. On the other
    hand, it may also be better for your manifesting because by being unattached,
    you can sometimes remove blockages that are created by wanting something too much.
    So, it's always good to find that fine line between not wanting something too
    much or too little with desire, but to approach it as naturally as anything else
    that you've received.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Distractions often pose big obstacles that get in the way of people finishing
    the things they've started and it can sometimes take work to stay motivated on
    the task at hand. The same is true for manifesting things into your life. But
    though persistence, you can continue to make more and more progress towards your
    goal as you keep working to overcome the obstacles along the way.
