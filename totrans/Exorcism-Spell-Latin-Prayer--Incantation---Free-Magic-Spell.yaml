- en: The method of exorcism most useful against demons is to recite an incantation
    which is long and detailed, which is heavily charged with energy that comes not
    from the mind, but from the glory of the gods.  This kind of exorcism is often
    used by religions such as Christianity, because you do not need to possess magical
    gifts to be able to use energy that comes from the gods. This method is a good
    one for two reasons. First, it uses a force so pure that when the demon leaves
    the body of the victim, it will already be so immersed in this energy that it
    will be annihilated. Secondly, you do not need to adapt the incantation according
    to the identity or strength of the evil spirit, since the power of the gods still
    exceed the power of the demon. Here is a prayer of exorcism which became particularly
    strong after being used in different variations for centuries against many demons.
    It is in Latin and is the root of the pagan rites of exorcism used by Christians
    **Regna terrae, cantata Deo, psallite Cernunnos,** **Regna terrae, cantata Dea
    psallite Aradia.** **caeli Deus, Deus terrae,** **Humiliter majestati gloriae
    tuae supplicamus** **Ut ab omni infernalium spirituum potestate,** **Laqueo, and
    deceptione nequitia,** **Omnis fallaciae, libera nos, dominates.** **Exorcizamus
    you omnis immundus spiritus** **Omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio,** **Infernalis
    adversarii, omnis legio,** **Omnis and congregatio secta diabolica.** **Ab insidiis
    diaboli, libera nos, dominates,** **Ut coven tuam secura tibi libertate servire
    facias,** **Te rogamus, audi nos!** **Ut inimicos sanctae circulae humiliare digneris,**
    **Te rogamus, audi nos!** **Terribilis Deus Sanctuario suo,** **Cernunnos ipse
    truderit virtutem plebi Suae,** **Aradia ipse fortitudinem plebi Suae.** **Benedictus
    Deus, Gloria Patri,** **Benedictus Dea, Matri gloria!** The most obvious disadvantage
    of this method of exorcism is the magnitude of the incantation; this is not a
    short formula that is easy to learn by heart. Although each word will gradually
    weaken and enrage the demon, the exorcism will not be over until you have reached
    the end of the prayer.  However, the demon will immediately recognise this incantation
    from the very first words, and will do everything in their power in order to silence
    the person reciting the formula.  So if you want to use this form of exorcism,
    you must know the incantation by heart, and have a strong resolve to avoid being
    interrupted before pronouncing the last word.
