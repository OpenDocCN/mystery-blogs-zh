- en: Palden Lhamo is a powerful female protector. Known as Shri Devi in Sanskrit(not
    to be confused with Lakshmi who is different), Palden Lhamo is one of the wrathful
    Buddhist deities. She protects the lamas, monks, nuns, the Dalai Lama, and many
    holy ones. All who worship her will be protected by her. Palden Lhamo was once
    a woman who was forced to marry an evil king and gave birth to an evil son. She
    couldn't convince the king to be good and the evil king wanted to ban Buddhism.
    Sensing that her son was to be the evil one who would destroy all the dharma,
    sutras, mantras, and Buddhism, she was forced to kill her son in order to save
    the world. She drank his blood, ate his flesh, and flayed him. As she fled on
    a white mule, her furious husband shot the mule, but she healed it making the
    spot become an eye to watch over all. However, when she went to hell, she escaped
    stealing a sword and bag of diseases from the hellish protectors. She fought her
    way to her earth only to have no peace and live in the charnel grounds as a hag.
    She cried out to the Buddha for a reason to live. The Buddha appeared before her
    and asked her to become a protector of Buddhism and the dharma. Astonished, she
    agreed and is now the wrathful protector. She is the only female wrathful deity
    of Buddhism. Chanting her mantra will ensure her protection and get rid of enemies
    or anyone who harms her followers, holy men, or innocent people. Remember, she
    was forced to kill her son in order to save the world. She will do whatever it
    takes to save and protect all living beings and the world.

- en: To begin, this would work if you worship Palden Lhamo. Calling on any spiritual
    being, deity or otherwise, for help requires something in exchange. If you work
    with her, asking her for protection makes sense. If you do not, you should provide
    an offering of thanks. Regarding the actual spell, lighting incense, calling on
    a deity, and saying a chant can work to protect you from spiritual danger. How
    well this works will vary.
