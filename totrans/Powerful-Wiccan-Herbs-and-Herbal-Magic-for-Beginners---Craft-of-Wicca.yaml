    type of use of Wiccan herbs will play a background role in the spell. You will
    prepare this ahead of time and then use the scent to enhance your magic.

    to ingest the herb. This type of use of Wiccan herbs will be the primary focus
    of the spell. Your magic with the herbs will happen at the time of the spell,
    for example, making a love tea, which can then be drunk at any time afterward
    to complete the spell.
  prefs: []
