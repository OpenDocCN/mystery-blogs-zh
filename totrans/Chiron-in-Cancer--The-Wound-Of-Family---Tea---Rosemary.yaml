    we develop from an early age. While Chiron can be pretty difficult, it’s also
    *so* useful to know your own Chiron and explore the wound in order to heal it.

- en: If you have Chiron in Cancer, you have an especially difficult wound that comes
    from family, however keep in mind that there is always a silver lining! Those
    with Chiron in Cancer can end up being incredible parents, aunts and uncles, or
    even just extremely loving people if they’re able to work through this wound.

    been abandoned.

    childhood family trauma that leads to core feelings of loneliness, emotional pain,
    or emptiness.

- en: '**In the first scenario**, the person with Chiron in Cancer will withdraw from
    love. They will only pursue relationships with unattainable people (or those who
    are definitely not interested), which only reinforces the idea that they are unlovable.'
  prefs: []

- en: They may fantasize about people who they can never have a successful relationship
    with or they may live the single life indefinitely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this scenario, the person might also technically enter into relationships
    but refuse to actually open up. They are so afraid of losing nurture (as they
    did in childhood) that they never try to get it in the first place. This person’s
    fear of loss is the main issue here, but this stems from the original wound.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Alternatively (in the second scenario)**, the person will go overboard nurturing
    others. They may smother their partners and friends and become the typical needy
    Cancer individual who is looking for emotional attention and validation 24/7.'

- en: The native with Chiron in Cancer has a constant, nagging feeling of emptiness;
    they search for ways to fill this hole up. They often over-idealize partners by
    putting them on a pedestal in order to distract from their own inner turmoil,
    but they have extremely painful breakups when these relationships inevitably fail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a relationship does end, the person will feel as though they have lost
    everything. They don’t know how to exist without the other person because they
    used the relationship to compensate for their own wound.

- en: Those with Chiron in Cancer are especially vulnerable around family. This hole
    inside them feels extra painful around family members and they may act different
    to try and gain any sort of praise, attention, love, etc., when what they are
    really seeking is nurture and acceptance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They will probably go to any lengths to get love from other people, especially
    family and intimate friends. They may pretend to be someone they’re not, self-sacrifice
    for others, boat, lie, or delude themselves about who the other person is. The
    thing that matters most to these natives is replacing the hole inside themselves
    with love.

- en: This wound almost always comes from early experiences with family. Often, this
    person has core issues with the mother, but the house that Chiron is in will show
    the initial wounding more clearly. It is also possible to have this placement
    due to the father or family in general.

    abandonment, or even abuse.

    by idealization or by contempt. If they have lost their one of their parents early
    on, for any reason, they are inclined towards idealization; if they were abandoned,
    they are inclined towards disappointment and contempt. May also swing back and
    forth

- en: The Chiron in Cancer person’s instinct is to avoid or bandaid the pain, but
    this is only a temporary fix. Instead, they will need to go *through* the pain.

- en: More than any other placement, Chiron in Cancer requires therapeutic-like work
    to heal. If traditional therapy isn’t an option (although I do feel that a good
    therapist can help a native with this placement make leaps and bounds), then I
    recommend looking to books or YouTube videos.

    issues, codependency, working with attachment styles, and developing boundaries.

    this person has so much pain and has successful worked through it, they can be
    some of the most loving and caring people on the earth.
