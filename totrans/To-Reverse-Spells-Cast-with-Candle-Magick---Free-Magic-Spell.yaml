    if you do not work with these deities. Why must it be done for five days? Why
    two candles? I would use one candle. If you know the person who cast on you, carve
    their name into the candle. A photo would also help. Anoint the candle with oil
    and roll them in a mixture of black pepper, cloves, and thyme. Take some tin foil,
    place it on the working surface, then the photo with the picture facing the tin
    foil, and finally the candle on top of that. The refection of the tin foil will
    act as a mirror and reflect the energy back at the person. Light the candle, say
    a return to sender chant. I would not use this one unless you work with specific
    deities. If you do, call on those deities. Then let the candle burn out as you
    contemplate how this will effect the person. After the spell, bundle the remaining
    items and dispose of them. Burying them off property might be best, but you toss
    them in an outdoor trash symbolic of what you think of them. I would also cleanse
    and protect yourself to ensure you do not feel another witches attacks in future.
