Relationships fail and regrets will start to set in which could lead you to wanting to get the romance back on the road. If this is your situation, this spell might be the best answer that you need. It is recommended that you ask your ex’s permission to cast the spell so they cannot accuse you of manipulation.

**What You Need**

You will need a red candle as well as a handful of dried beans. There is no set number of beans needed for this spell. You also need to have a small, heat-resistant bowl.

**The Spell**

To start the spell, you need to recall how happy you and your ex were during your relationship and when you are full of the warm, nostalgic glow you should light the candle. In the flame of the candle, you should see the feelings you and the other person had for each other. At this point, you need to clasp the beans in your hand see them filling with these feelings.

Once the beans are full, you should place them in the bowl and move this clockwise above the flame of the candle. When doing this, you should take care to not burn yourself. The beans are the catalyst that will bring you and your ex back together. As you do this, you should say these words or something similar:

*Love that was, please be recovered.*
*Let us be what we were to one another,*
*And let it be done, that it harm no one.*

After the spell has been cast, you will need to take the beans and place them in the ground. The location should be a place where you know your ex will walk by regularly.
