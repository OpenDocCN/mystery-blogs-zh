> 来源：[https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/energy_spells/18402/page.html#0001-01-01](https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/spiritual_spells/energy_spells/18402/page.html#0001-01-01)

**Charging**

This spell was newly made, and is best done if charged.

Get out a piece of paper and write down the spell name, it's purpose, requirements, and incantation.

*Yes, you have to physically write down the whole spell. You can shorten it a little, as long as if it doesn't change the meaning, etc.*

Now, place your hand over the paper and imagine your energy running through your veins. Imagine putting that energy into the spell. **Note: Don't use too much of your energy, save some for the spell.** Also, imagine energy coming from mother nature (from plants, the ground, etc.) imagine it coming from the ground, going through your body, through your hand and into the paper. Imagine energy coming from the universe (imagine the sky, the stars, the clouds, etc) going down through the top of your head, through your body, through your hand and into the paper.

While or after you do this, (you can hold the paper if you want) still imagine the energy flowing into the paper and chant:

''Wind, fire, water, earth,

I call on you to make this spell magick

so mote it be.''

(Chant from: http://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/love_spells/enchanting_spells/17050/page.html )

You can make up your own chant as well if you'd like.

During this, you may feel coldness, warmth, tingling, etc.

After, you may get a headache. This is a sign you used too much of your own energy, or it was too much energy that you couldn't handle just yet.

Now, you are able to perform the spell.

**Performing the spell**

Sit on the floor comfortably. It's best if you sit up straight leaning against a wall or door.

Place the candles in front of you at a angle (facing your knees, as you are sitting cross-legged.)

Light the candles and place a small glass bowl (metal, ceramic, etc not plastic since it releases toxins) in front of you.

Get a small piece of paper (one inch width x length) it does not have to be exact measurements.

Write the following:

Your Name

Date of birth

The words, ''bring me power''

Current date.

while you are doing this, imagine the outcome and focus on your energy.

draw a drop of blood and place it on the paper.

While you are writing on the paper and adding your blood to the paper, chant the following:

''Fire in thy casters veins,

grant me thou dearest wish.

Herbs in mother nature's womb,

Show me what I have missed.''

continue to chant this as you light the paper with the candle's flame and placing it in the bowl to burn out. Sprinkle (or place a leaf of) rosemary, basil and thyme leaves.

After you add the last herb, chant one more time. Then, add:

''This is my will,

So mote it be.''

let the paper burn out.

now, focus on your energy and the energy within the room.

Imagine the outcome.

When you feel ready, blow out the candles and place the bowl in a dark place, where no one else will find it or touch it.

If you start to get bad luck, rinse the bowl and it's contents out immediately.

If the spell works, you should feel more energy and power, as well as you should start to awaken and develop your current abilities, if any.

Once you are satisfied, or whenever you feel like it, rinse the bowl out and it's contents.

If you do start to see results with your abilities, do not rinse the bowl immediately. You can give it time. The contents in the bowl is what drawing in power, so if you rinse it out, it stops the spell from working, meaning, it stops drawing in more power.

Good luck. If you need help, mail me!
