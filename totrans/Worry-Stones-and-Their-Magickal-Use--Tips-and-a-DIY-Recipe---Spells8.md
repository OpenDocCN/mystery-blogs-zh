# Worry Stones and Their Magickal Use: Tips and a DIY Recipe ‚Äì Spells8

> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://spells8.com/worry-stones-meaning/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/worry-stones-meaning/#0001-01-01)

A worry stone, sometimes called a palm stone depending on the size, is a **smooth stone with a thumb-sized indentation** in the middle. They are often round or oval in shape for easier handling. These stones are easy to carry with you wherever you go, perfect to pick out of your pocket when you need to take a minute and de-stress.

It is possible that these small, smooth stones have been used in many cultures across the world in times of stress. Their origins are often credited to [Ancient Greece](https://spells8.com/greek-deities-devotionals/) in the form of palm stones, but it is not hard to imagine that many cultures had similar practices. Keep reading to learn how you can benefit from the use of worry stones in your magickal practice.

## What are worry stones made from?

There are many different materials that a worry stone can be made from. These include natural stones, crystals and gems, clay, and even glass. The material used, or found, may even **play a role in how you can use the worry stone** in your magickal practice. In most cases, it is common to find worry stones made of natural materials. Plastic is not generally used as it is not considered natural.

**Natural worry stones** are simple stones that have been worn down through erosion, usually by a natural body of water. You may find smooth stones while walking through a river or along the beach. The next time you are walking along a body of water, keep an eye out for a worry stone perfect for you! These particular stones may have the added benefit of being connected to both the element of Water and Earth.

Worry stones made from **crystals or other precious gemstones** are usually tumbled, though some may be rough cuts with a smooth surface. These particular worry stones would need to be made from skin safe, non-porous, and solid stones. Sorry, that rough piece of selenite you have is not a good candidate for a worry stone! As natural pieces of the earth, worry stones made from crystals or other gemstones are natural connections with the element of Earth.

Have you ever been walking along the beach and found a piece of sea glass? Yes, that‚Äôs right! **Glass can also be used as a worry stone.** In this case, the glass would not be sharp so as not to cut yourself while using it. Do you know how glass is made? Glass is made by heating up sand to very high temperatures. Worry stones made from glass may have the added benefit of being connected to both the element of Earth and Fire.

You may even want to **make your own worry stones!** The best medium for this would be baked clay, though any sort of solid material would work. The material you use to make your clay would lend itself to the connections it has with the element. If you use baked clay, it may have the added connection to the element of Fire. If you use air dry clay, it may have the added connection of the element of Earth. Keep reading for a recipe to make your own!

## How do you use a worry stone?

Worry stones are used as a [grounding](https://spells8.com/lessons/grounding-mindfulness/) tool to help those who may have anxiety, depression, or a general feeling of worry. The small indentation on the smooth stone, if there is one at all, is the perfect size for a thumb or finger. When using a worry stone, you would rub the smooth surface of the stone with your finger while being mindful of the sensation. You may even perform a [small meditation](https://spells8.com/%e2%96%b6%ef%b8%8f-witch-music-full-moon-meditation/), practicing keeping the mind focused on one simple movement to calm the nerves. This is a wonderfully simple grounding technique for the busy mind.

Within a witchcraft practice, a worry stone can be consecrated for specific uses or simply used as is. Remember from before: you can make your own worry stones or use stones made from [tumbled crystals](https://spells8.com/crystals-galore-whats-your-favorite/). If you make your own worry stones, it will be **easy to incorporate different ingredients, intentions, and symbols** into your creation. This can include [sigils](https://spells8.com/sigil-making-101/) or [symbols](https://spells8.com/10-magical-symbols/), dried [herbs](https://spells8.com/green-witch-magic-grimoire/), [oils](https://spells8.com/topic/moon-mother-oil-recipe/), and [energy](https://spells8.com/weekly-challenge-energy-work-2022/).

## Crystal Worry Stones

Just like you can paint your own clay worry stone a specific color for a specific intention, you may want to choose a crystal worry stone based on the crystal‚Äôs magickal properties. In doing so, you can invite the energy of that crystal to help you work your magick.

**Clear Quartz** ‚Äì Considered by many to be a master healing, use a [clear quartz](https://spells8.com/mental-clarity-spell-quartz/) worry stone for protection, mental clarity, and healing.

**Rose Quartz** ‚Äì This beautiful pink stone is the center of self-love. If you are dealing with self-doubt, use a [rose quartz](https://spells8.com/rose-quartz-love-activation/) worry stone with affirmations of self-love.

**Black Tourmaline** ‚Äì For difficult and tumultuous times, black tourmaline may be your guide. Use a [black tourmaline](https://spells8.com/black-tourmaline-crystal-activation/) worry stone when you need emotional protection, grounding, and shielding energies.

**Fluorite** ‚Äì A [fluorite](https://spells8.com/fluorite-crystal-activation/) worry stone may be just what you need to increase concentration, focus, and awareness!

**Amber** ‚Äì Though not technically a crystal, this [fossilized resin](https://spells8.com/amber-crystal-activation/) from trees may be the perfect worry stone for you. An amber worry stone may help promote healing, reduce pain, and increase emotional awareness.

## Consecrating Worry Stones

As witches, we have the ability to make our tools and objects sacred. We do this through a ritual known as consecration. In doing so, we are affirming that the tool being consecrated will be used for one specific purpose, the purpose we give it during the ritual. You may want to consecrate your worry stones for specific purposes. Here are a few other ideas for uses of worry stones that may benefit from consecration.

If you do not know how to perform a consecration ritual, check out our handy guide and cast along video!

### Meditations

During meditation, the goal is to achieve an **altered state of consciousness** so that we may relax or commune with spirits. The simple act of rubbing a worry stone when we need to reach a meditative state may help you reach that state of mind faster. You may want to consecrate a specific worry stone for times when you are meditating to reduce stress. You may also want to consecrate a specific worry stone for rituals revolving healing, anxiety, stress, or self-love.

### Trancework

Just because they are called worry stones does not mean they must be used only when you worry. Often, these stones can help induce an altered state of consciousness, something many witches need if doing trancework. You might find it helpful to consecrate a specific worry stone for a deity. In doing so, you would **use this worry stone for all communication** and trancework with that particular deity.

### Sigil Activation

This particular use of a worry stone can be used if you make your own or if you buy a worry stone with a word, phrase, or affirmation inscribed on it. For example, if you inscribe a sigil on a worry stone for focus or awareness during an exam, the **act of rubbing the worry stone** when you need it can activate the sigil for the time you require its use. You may find it helpful to consecrate specific worry stones for these purposes in your magickal practice.

Though worry stones are helpful outside of a magickal practice, there are many ways you can incorporate them into your daily life. These ideas here are just one way you can get started!
