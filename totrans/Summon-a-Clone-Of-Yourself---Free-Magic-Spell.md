It sounds good on paper and I really like the approach. However I feel that getting a death goddess involved it seems kind of counterintuitive. Besides I feel that using the graveyard soil is more than enough energy right?

You cannot summon a clone of yourself. At best, you can create a servitor. Even then, which death deity are you calling on and why?

Do I have to use graveyard soil/ashes or can I use something different, and how do you get rid of the clone after it has made its bid?

As tadashi pointed out in the previous comment, this spell will not work. You cannot summon a clone of yourself.

But could you create something that is human-like or at least looks like a human and grants you your wishes?

If you mean physically, no. If you mean some sort of thoughtform or servitor, perhaps. What that could do would be limited though. It wouldn't be able to do anything physical.
