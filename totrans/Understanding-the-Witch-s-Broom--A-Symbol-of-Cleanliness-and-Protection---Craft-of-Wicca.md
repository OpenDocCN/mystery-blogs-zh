 ## The History of the Wiccan Broom

The use of brooms in ritual and ceremonial contexts dates back to ancient times. In ancient Egypt, brooms were used to sweep away negative energy and purify spaces. Similarly, in ancient Europe, brooms were used in rituals to protect against evil spirits and negative energies.

 In Wicca, the broom is often used in rituals of protection and purification. It is used to sweep away negative energy and to create a sacred space for ritual and ceremony. The broom is also used to draw boundaries and to mark the boundaries of sacred space.

 ## The Symbolism of the Witch’s Broom

The Wiccan broom is a symbol of cleanliness and protection. The act of sweeping is symbolic of clearing away negative energy and creating a sacred space. The broom is also a symbol of boundaries and of marking the boundaries of sacred space.

 In addition to its symbolic meanings, the Wiccan broom also has practical uses. It is often used to sweep away physical dirt and debris in order to create a clean and sacred space. It is also used to sweep away negative energy and to purify a space before rituals or ceremonies.

## How to Use a Wiccan Broom

To use a Wiccan broom, begin by consecrating the broom. This can be done by holding the broom and charging it with energy while visualizing it as a powerful tool for purification and protection.

 Next, use the broom to sweep the area you wish to purify and consecrate. Begin by sweeping the perimeter of the space, working your way inward. As you sweep, visualize the broom sweeping away negative energy and creating a sacred space.

 When you have finished sweeping, you can use the broom to mark the boundaries of your sacred space. This can be done by placing the broom across the entrance to your sacred space or by leaning the broom against a wall or other object.

You can also use your Wiccan broom to create a protective barrier around yourself or your home by sweeping around the perimeter of your space.

 ## How to Make Your Own Besom for Wiccan and Pagan Rituals

A besom, also known as a broom, is a traditional tool used in Wiccan and pagan rituals for purification and protection. The act of sweeping with a besom is symbolic of sweeping away negative energy and making way for positive change. Making your own besom can be a fun and rewarding experience, as it allows you to infuse your tool with your own energy and intentions.

### Materials Needed

To make your own besom, you will need the following materials:

 *   A wooden handle (traditionally made from ash wood)
*   A bundle of besom straw or broom corn
*   Twine or cord
*   Scissors
*   A drill (optional)

### Step 1: Preparing the Handle

The first step in making your own besom is to prepare the handle. If you are using a pre-made wooden handle, make sure it is smooth and free of any rough edges. If you are using a branch or piece of wood, you will need to sand it down to create a smooth surface.

If you wish to add a personal touch to your besom, you can use a drill to create a design or symbol on the handle. This can be as simple as a spiral or as complex as a specific sigil.

 ### Step 2: Bundling the Straw

The next step is to bundle the straw or broom corn. You will need a bundle that is approximately the same length as your handle. Take the bundle of straw and secure it at one end with twine or cord. Then, begin to tightly wrap the twine or cord around the bundle, making sure to keep the straw tightly packed together. Once you reach the end of the bundle, secure it with another piece of twine or cord.

### Step 3: Attaching the Bundle to the Handle

Now that you have your bundle of straw and your handle prepared, it’s time to attach them together. Take the bundle of straw and place it on top of the handle, making sure that the handle is centered within the bundle. Use twine or a cord to tightly secure the bundle to the handle.

 ### Step 4: Trimming and Shaping

The final step is to shape and trim your besom to your desired shape. You can trim the straw to create a point at the bottom or a more rounded shape. Once you are satisfied with the shape of your besom, you can use any remaining twine or cord to decorate the top of the besom.
