Does this work?

It might. I doubt the whole ''guess the animal'' part, because anyone could say ''I like this animal, it's my spirit guide'' when it's not. To get a spirit animal or guide is through a spiritual journey [also, theres the matter of appropriating native culture since spirit animals/totums/guides are native] I would say this chant before meditating, or before bed, then be observant, journal, and be open to anything. Also, be aware that just because a crow lands in front of you, it's not your spirit animal. Should you see crows everywhere [groups everywhere you go, pictures in buildings or online, articles about crows and their spiritual significance, overhearing people talking about crows, and dreaming about them] this would be considered a sign that a crow is your spirit animal. If you're already obsessed with a specific animal, your mind might be seeking patterns that aren't there. Try it if you wish, but I would research going to a ritual [lead by a reputable person of the native community] or other more in depth rituals/meditations on the subject
