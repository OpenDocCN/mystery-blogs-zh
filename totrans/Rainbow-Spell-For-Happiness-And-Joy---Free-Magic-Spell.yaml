- en: 'ou Will Need: 7 Candles, 7 Ribbons and 7 Flowers, in each case one in each
    color of the rainbow. The rainbow colors also represent the old planets of the
    Zodiac: Red for Mars, Orange for Sun, Yellow for Moon, Green for Mercury, Blue
    for Venus, Indigo for Jupiter and Violet for Saturn. Tie each candle at the base
    with its matching colored ribbon. In each of seven rooms in your house, or seven
    places in one room if you live somewhere smaller, place one candle with its matching
    flower in a stem vase, to make a simple yet colorful alter. Open all the windows
    and ask for nature''s blessings: promise to honor nature more attentively in the
    future, by leaving out crumbs for the birds, growing more plants and flowers,
    not killing creatures who come inside and recycling as much as you can for the
    sake of the environment. Promise, too, to try t0 smile more and not to criticize
    others too much. Light your candles in the order of the Rainbow colors (as above)
    and feel the color of each light burning into you. Sit in the middle of the room
    (or house) and surround yourself mentally with the swirling light of every colors.
    After one hour, extinguish the candles and untie the ribbons, then wind them loosely
    together into a braid. Repeat this procedure for six more nights, undoing the
    ribbons from the braid, and retying them them each time. At the end of the week,
    when the flowers will have wilted and the candles burnt down, take the ribbons
    and weave them into a tidy braid. This will become your most powerful talisman,
    and will always attract Rainbow colors into your life. Recharge the braid at an
    open window on one day of every month, and always keep it in a special place.'
