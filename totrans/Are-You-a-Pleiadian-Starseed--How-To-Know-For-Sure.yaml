    and have come here in droves in the past few decades—because they have a real
    purpose here! Starseeds tend to come to earth together, so if you are a starseed,
    you tend to be surrounded by other starseeds. If this is the case, then you almost
    surely know a Pleiadian starseed.

  zh: 2\. 你喜欢生活中的感官享受
- en: Pleiadian starseeds are well known for their enjoyment of the sensual side of
    life, especially sex. On the Pleiades, they did not have such physical bodies,
    so the existence of the physical body is something that the Pleiadian starseed
    wants to explore fully– and has a very fun time doing so.

  zh: 昴宿星人以他们对生活中感官享受的热爱而闻名，尤其是性。在昴宿星，他们没有这样的物理身体，所以昴宿星人想要充分探索物质身体的存在——并且做这些事情非常有趣。
- en: They may also struggle with addictions in many forms because of the physicality
    of earth, but sex seems to be a universal love of the Pleiadian starseeds. They
    are a bit more provocative than the other starseeds. Because they have such a
    romantic spirit and tend to prioritize romantic love over other forms, sex has
    a special place in the Pleiadian starseeds life.

  zh: 他们可能也会因为地球的物质性而在许多形式上挣扎，但性似乎是昴宿星人普遍喜爱的一种情感。他们比其他星际种子更具挑衅性。因为他们具有浪漫的精神并倾向于将浪漫爱情置于其他形式之上，性在昴宿星人生活中有着特殊的地位。
- en: There is actually a test that you can do to see if you are fully aligned with
    your Pleiadian nature, and it has to do with your comfort level during sex. If
    you are very comfortable and relaxed, you may be more aligned with your Pleiadian
    energy. If you are uncomfortable or tense, than this is a good indicator that
    you need to reconnect with source and with your divine nature.

  zh: 实际上有一个测试可以测试你是否完全与你的昴宿星本质对齐，这与你在性行为中的舒适程度有关。如果你感到非常舒适和放松，你可能与你的昴宿星能量更加对齐。如果你感到不舒服或紧张，那么这是一个很好的指示你需要重新连接源头和你的神圣本质。
- en: Pleiadians just like sex. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you have
    not yet worked through your codependency issues that a lot of Pleiadian starseeds
    come in with, it could be very confusing. Pleiadian starseeds should learn that
    even on earth, sex and love are not the same thing. It is great to enjoy them
    both, but they are separate things.

  zh: 昴宿星人就像性一样。这不一定是一件坏事，但如果你还没有解决好昴宿星人带来的很多共依存问题，可能会非常困惑。昴宿星人应该学会，即使在地球上，性和爱不是同一件事情。享受它们两者都很棒，但它们是分开的事情。

  zh: 1\. 你有竞争意识
- en: Pleiadian starseeds are very competitive and may love sports and games. One
    Pleiadian starseed I know actually got up in the middle of a game of Settlers
    of Catan and tried to leave because she wasn’t winning. So yes, they are also
    poor losers sometimes.

  zh: 星际种子的昴宿星人很有竞争力，可能喜欢运动和游戏。我认识的一个昴宿星人实际上在一场《卡坦岛屿》游戏中起身试图离开，因为她没有赢。所以是的，有时候他们也是输不起的。
- en: In the Pleiades, games and sports are considered one of the highest of honors,
    and people spend lifetimes mastering their craft. Pleiadian starseeds may be drawn
    to sports or games at an early age, or may just be competitive about whatever
    their skill is. They often feel they must be *the best* at the thing that they
    do.

  zh: 在昴宿星，游戏和体育被认为是最高的荣誉之一，人们花费一生时间来精通他们的技艺。昴宿星人可能在很小的时候就被吸引到运动或游戏，或者只是对他们的技能有竞争心理。他们经常觉得自己必须成为*最好的*。
