    out that there are spoonie witches too, and are curious what they are. Or maybe
    you are suffering from a chronic illness just like them, so you wonder what if
    you are a spoonie witch too.

    of witches with low energy, either due to chronic conditions or differing abilities.
    They adjust their practices to the demands of their condition to create adaptive,
    inclusive, and less taxing magical practices.**'

- en: The [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spoonie)
    refers to a “spoonie” as someone living with a long-term illness, especially a
    physical one. Many people with chronic mental illness have identified with this
    term too, which originated from Christine Miserandino’s [Spoon Theory](https://www.healthline.com/health/spoon-theory-chronic-illness-explained-like-never-before).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She explains this in her blog, [But You Don’t Look Sick](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/),
    where she describes what it’s like to live with chronic illness so healthy people
    can understand. What healthy don’t realize is that chronically sick people have
    excruciating difficulty just going through normal activities of daily living that
    regular folks take for granted, like getting out of bed or taking a shower.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Miserandino uses a spoon as a unit of measurement to quantify energy. Chronically
    ill and physically/mentally challenged people have a limited supply of energy,
    so if they can view energy in a tangible form, they can manage their reserves
    better and preserve what they currently have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One spoon stands for one unit of energy for accomplishing a single daily activity,
    like getting dressed or taking a shower. A sick person with a limited number of
    spoons has to ration their energy. They must plan their day stringently—and in
    advance—so they don’t run out of spoons.

- en: Taking from this definition, a spoonie witch is one with a chronic illness who
    practices witchcraft in consideration of his or her health issues. As a result,
    spoonie witches use their magic and other skills to deal with their malady and
    help others like them.

    witch, addressed those apprehensive about joining the spoonie witch community
    (since outsiders often associate witchcraft with “the black arts”) when she said:
    “Witchcraft does not always have to be a religion. It does not always have to
    be a spiritual journey. Sometimes it’s just a practice.”'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spoonie witchcraft is a practice connected with the spoon theory—a metaphor
    for the use of energy in dealing with chronic illness, disability, or mental disorders.
    This theory uses spoons as representations of mental or physical energy used to
    function in daily life. Disability or illness impacts the way spoons are used
    up.

- en: If a sick person runs out of spoons, he has to rest until his spoons are restored.
    A used spoon can only be replaced if he rests. But resting doesn’t necessarily
    guarantee a person more spoons. Many disabled people have a continuously low supply
    of energy, especially if they have sleep disorders or mental health issues.
