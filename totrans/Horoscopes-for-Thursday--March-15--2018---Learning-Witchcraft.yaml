- en: Pisces is a sign of many talents but on a material level you sometimes leave
    things to chance. The message of your birthday chart this year is that where money
    matters and business issues are concerned you need to be a bit more worldly-wise.

    you must not allow them to distract you from your number one aim: getting your
    finances in some sort of order. Only after that is done can you afford to get
    involved.'

- en: It’s perfectly natural that you are angry with someone who has let you down
    but don’t let it gnaw at you to such an extent that it ruins your entire day.
    Talking of days, the Sun leaves your sign on the 20th. Do something big before
    then.

- en: Your confidence seems to be at a low ebb at the moment but there is no reason
    for it to be. A week or so from now the Sun will move into your sign and a new
    and more promising phase will begin. Look forward to that – and smile!

- en: You don’t have to go along with what everyone else wants to do. In fact the
    planets strongly suggest you should aim to do something completely different today,
    if for no other reason than to remind certain people that you have a mind of your
    own.

- en: The Sun in the career area of your chart can do wonders for your reputation,
    but it can also damage your social and professional standing if you don’t play
    by the rules. There will be plenty of time for fun and games later – but be serious
    today.

    your back on them and walk away. You don’t need beneficial terms, still less handouts,
    from people you don’t know you can trust. Try trusting yourself instead.

    only will you not be able to resolve them but you could end up turning both sides
    against you. Chances are your intervention will do more harm than good.

    seek approval. Whatever the reason you need to get past it today and get back
    to a position where what others say and do has no effect on you at all.

    abilities? The answer to both those questions is a resounding “No!” You’re a Libra,
    a cardinal sign, and nothing is ever too much for you. Believe it, it’s true.

    that because you feel great the rest of the world feels great as well. No Scorpio,
    when you close your eyes it does not mean it’s night – it means you cannot see.

    used to seeing you as super optimistic that they may find it hard to believe you
    are hurting inside. They will, of course, assist you – but first they need to
    know you need help.

    they may seem. If you want to make a financial contribution make it to a legitimate
    charity or organization where you know your money will make a difference.
