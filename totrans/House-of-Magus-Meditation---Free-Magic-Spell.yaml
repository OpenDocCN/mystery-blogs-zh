    If you choose to play something, nature sounds would be good for this exercise.

    You are walking on a stone path that cuts through a field of red and white flowers.
    The sky is a vibrant blue with few clouds. Take your time stepping through here
    and pick a couple of flowers, smell them. The white ones could smell like gardenias,
    the red ones like roses. Take in the beautiful scents and the sun on your skin.
    Keep walking a bit.

    get closer, you see that the front doors are open. It looks safe and no one is
    around, so you decide to go into the castle. You see a grand staircase in front
    of you with flags of all symbols going up the railing. To the left and right,
    you see doors. You decide to go to your right and shake the door handle to see
    that the door is unlocked. You step inside, and find a room with one window at
    the opposite side of the room. In the middle of the room, there is a small and
    modest altar. Upon it, you see a pentagram, a cup, some coins and a wand.

    through you. You point the want to the ground and feel energy going out from this
    wand going to the floor, and you feel the tingle of it on the bottoms of your
    feet. At your amazement, you put the wand down and contemplate what has just happened.

    trail.
