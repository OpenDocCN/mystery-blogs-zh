The Midheaven (MC) and the Imum coeli (IC) are two opposite points in astrology that are calculated based on your place and time of birth. The IC shows the qualities that you learned in childhood and the environment that you wanted to escape.

In order to get away from the values of the IC, you push towards the Midheaven. In fact, the Midheaven is how people tend to perceive you in the outer world, but more specifically in your career. Although you may embrace the qualities of your Midheaven, the IC always exists underneath.

The IC in Scorpio placement is all about issues power and control in childhood. As an adult, you look for stability and material success to try and escape that sense of darkness.

Keep in mind that the Midheaven and IC are always opposite signs, so you can’t have one without the other.

## IC In Scorpio:

With your IC in Scorpio, you have some serious trauma from childhood. Your wounds are deep and repressed, but you need to keep them unconscious because the trauma is simply too much for your conscious mind to handle.

IC in Scorpio tends to be an especially traumatic placement. With the sign of Scorpio, you may have an even more repressed inner world than others.

As a child with IC in Scorpio, you may have had an emotionally chaotic home atmosphere. There were some intense power struggles in your family that could have manifested in many different ways.

However, even though you were suppressed in some way by your family system due to these power struggles, you *also* had to make adult decisions at a young age. 

IC in Scorpio means that you childhood may have had elements of alcoholism, abuse, death, trauma, sex, or manipulation. Maybe one of your parents had a mental illness, control issues, or were strange in some way.

This can manifest in many different ways. For example, many people with IC in Scorpio experienced physical or sexual abuse as children. Others experienced emotional abuse or power trips from one or both of their parents.

In some way, you had to step up and be the adult even when you were young. Your conscious mind wasn’t ready to make adult decisions, but family circumstances forced you into the role.

With IC in Scorpio, members of your family may have been pitted against each other. You felt like there was a lack of control in the family, even though everyone was trying *to* control each other. You probably felt as though you had very little *personal* power.

The themes of power and control were always present in your childhood. In fact, IC in Scorpio is all about control. Any form of abuse or trauma left a mark on you because you felt like you weren’t in control of what happened in your life.

As you grow with IC in Scorpio, you learn that vulnerability is bad. You realize that when you show weakness, others can take advantage of you.

The lessons of power and control in your childhood probably make you shut down in same way. You bury your trauma and control your outer personal by closing yourself up as much as possible.

In fact, IC in Scorpio is one of the most repressed placements in the birth chart. You may need to do some serious digging to access the trauma that stems from your childhood. Look to the themes of power and control and see how these values played out in your family system.

## Midheaven In Taurus:

Now, with Midheaven in Taurus, you’ve taught yourself how to be independent. You don’t want anyone to control you, so you figured out how to live without relying on anyone else, using your most natural skills.

In your career, you probably want a secure job with clearly defined boundaries. Instability is scary to you, and you *definitely* don’t want an emotionally controlling career. You’re grounded and competent in the workplace. 

Sometimes, people with Midheaven in Taurus are really attractive or sensual. You learned about your best qualities in childhood because these were the only things you had control over, so you now use these qualities to be successful.

People with Midheaven in Taurus can often have a sensual streak, and you may have picked up on this and used it to your advantage.

You’re also patient and stable. From your childhood trauma, you learned that slow and steady wins the race. You want to create consistency and a sense of security so that no one else ever has power over you.

This means that you’re a really hard worker. You probably have big ideas with Midheaven in Taurus, but you also know how to execute them, by taking the steps that are necessary to achieve these goals.

You may not be very emotional in your career. It’s even possible that emotions scare you because of the *chaos* you encountered in childhood, much of which was due to turbulent emotions in your family system.

Instead, you’re factual and clear-cut. You may be focused on tangible things, such as beauty/looks or possessions and money, because these are things that you can measure.

As a career choice, the Midheaven in Taurus placement can manifest in a few different ways. Taurus rules the home, money, and possessions, but it also rules beauty and sensuality.

For example, Donald Trump’s Midheaven is in Taurus (real estate, money, possessions) but Marilyn Monroe also had Midheaven in Taurus (money, beauty, sensuality). These are slightly different outcomes for the placement, but for both people, their careers were a way to escape the turbulent control of their childhood.

The purpose of your Midheaven in Taurus is always to control your *own* environment. You never want to relive the trauma of your childhood, so you try to stabilize your life. You’ve learned that you can only rely on yourself for safety and security.

You desire things to be physical and defined. You don’t want to descend into the darkness of your childhood, where emotions *and* physical possessions feel muddy, never knowing who owns what. With your Midheaven in Taurus, *things* make sense to you, but power and abusive emotions do not.

While your Midheaven in Taurus can make you very successful, don’t forget about your inner child. At some point, you need to look inside and heal the wounds from childhood. This will help you learn to be vulnerable while keeping your own personal power.

Healing the IC in Scorpio takes a *lot* of time. This placement typically means that you have deeply buried trauma that may even be unconscious to you. Working with a therapist or doing shadow work can help to unlock some of this trauma.

Eventually, you must learn to accept your childhood self, even with all of the baggage that comes with acceptance. This is the only way to truly integrate both your IC in Scorpio and your Midheaven in Taurus placements so that you can be one whole person.

At some point with Midheaven in Taurus, you must learn that power comes from within. No one can truly take your power; it will *always* be yours. This is ultimately the lesson that these placements are teaching you.

Even in the worst situations, you will *always* have your own personal power.
