    a furry, and if you kinda hate it, you can turn back to your normal self.

    be an anthro. They should always get your message, but unless you have a good
    reason why you want to quit being 100% human and switch to 50% human.

    you won't worry about not getting a boy/girl if you're canine, you don't need
    to fret about your awful voice if you're avian, you get to skip work and school
    all you want when you're feline, and if you want to be huggable, be a... horse!
    With so many different choices to choose from, it's almost impossible to choose
    your future for most people.

    to be for subspecies. Use the same things except for the plates and stuff like
    that, if your cat doesn't have spikes, get rid of it and continue on, just alter
    it a bit. That's what I did

- en: You cannot physically transform into anything like NordStar said. However, Neko_wolfy6
    makes an excellent point, you can always alter a spell to suit your needs. It
    would add a little personal touch and enhance the spell in a way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a good point, Nekoshema. I can see your point on this matter, but i have
    to disagree. I personally feel that transformation spells are possible. I do have
    to agree with you that some of these spells don't work, but it wouldn't hurt to
    give it a try,wold it?

    thing, correct, try it yourself and see if it works. people post to help, if you
    have doubts, try it and observe any results.

- en: You don't know if NordStar tried in this in the past or simply studied magick
    and learned through research magick cannot physically transform a human into a
    duck [or whatever nonsense you think it does] magick is a natural energy, that
    effects energy, to bring natural change. That's it. It doesn't contradict nature,
    or do the impossible. On the physical plane it is ruled by nature, that's just
    a fact.

    ate more and now about 5-6 days later (I am not sick) but my whole body starts
    to get hot and a couple days before that I had strong compulsions to pet myself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '''''instantly after 2 days''''? you may wish to look up the definition of ''''instantly''''.
    what you have described isn''t physical transformation [especially since this
    spell claims you become an animal, not hot and hungry] what you''re describing
    are placebos. you want it to be real, so your mind has tricked your body into
    displaying ''''symptoms'''' so you can convince yourself it''s real. magick on
    the physical doesn''t contradict nature. if you wish to transform into an animal,
    look into astral projection as you can transform your astral body into anything
    you desire.'

- en: Dude, there is so much tension here. I have tried this spell multiple times,
    but i'm still human.Though I do have a question. If your spirit was originally
    that of an animal's, like reincarnation and that, would it matter what spell you
    did to transform or shape-shift? Or will it not matter, because, as all of you
    say, your human? This question has popped up in my head multiple times and i just
    want to see if anybody knows the answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Physically, nothing would change. Transformation spells are to bring change
    into your life [say you want to stop a bad habit or become a ''whole new person''
    large changes can be helped with a transformation spell or calling on werewolf
    energy] If you were an otherkin [human body, animal spirit] I suppose this spell
    could help to transform your astral or spiritual form [though from what I've been
    told by otherkin when they project, their astral form is of their spiritual form,
    not their physical one] You can also use a transformation spell as your meditating
    or going on a spiritual journey. That can, in theory, bring change to your spirit.
    The point most make and argue is the physical has limitations of nature. The spiritual
    is limitless.
