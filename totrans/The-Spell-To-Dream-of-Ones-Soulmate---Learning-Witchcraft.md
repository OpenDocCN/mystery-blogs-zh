**Materials:**
Three Raisins
Three almonds

EIther milk or almond milk.
A red candle
Honey

You can now cast your circle and light your candle. Gaze into the candles falma une a peaceful and meditative feeling comes over you.

The raisins and almonds should be held in your hand, visualize meeting your true soulmate. Do not focus on the person, but on how you feel once you are together. Will there be a sense of safety and security? WIll you be overwhelmed with excitement? Will you be happy and full of laughter? Maybe you will feel everything that was mentioned above. This feeling should be held in your heart as you chant the following:

“Angels of love, spirits of union
This night bring to me a vision,
Allow that through my dream I may see,
When the time is right, my soul mate
So mote be it.”

The raisins and almonds can now be placed in the red cloth, the cloth should then be folded over them. The candle can be blown out and the circle closed.

With a teaspoon of honey, drink the milk, warmed if you prefer. Right before you go to sleep, the red cloth with the raisins and almonds must be placed under your pillow, your intention must be to dream of your soulmate.

**Note:** If is is difficult for you to recall your dreams, a week or more prior to performing this spell, you may want to practice dream recall. To do this, a journal must be kept next to your bed. The moment you wake up, lay very still and try to remember your dreams, as soon as you remember them all, write them down. As you practice, it will become easier to recall more and more of them.

Wish for you the sweetest of dreams!
