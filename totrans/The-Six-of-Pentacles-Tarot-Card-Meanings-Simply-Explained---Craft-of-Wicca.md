 The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, so it’s good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to have a good interpretation of the moment.

Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember, each reading, deck, person, position, and question is different. Reading the cards is an art, not a science.

 Here is a new interpretation of the Six of Pentacles tarot card:

 When it comes to technology, the Six of Pentacles is all about balance and fairness in the digital world. This card is a reminder to think about how you’re distributing your time and resources when it comes to technology.
