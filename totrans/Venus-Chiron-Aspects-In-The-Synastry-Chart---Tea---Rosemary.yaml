- en: Venus rules love, money, appearances, and in the synastry chart, *how* one loves.
    Meanwhile, Chiron is the doorway to one’s deepest wounds and insecurities. So
    in synastry, these two planets in aspect often indicate pain in love, yet there
    is also the potential for healing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most Venus-Chiron synastry aspects trigger wounds of love for the Chiron person.
    This means that they will be faced with all the ways they did not receive adequate
    love as a child and the impact of that absence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Venus-Chiron aspects also revolve around *value*, particularly of the *self*.
    The Chiron person might struggle to see themselves as valuable, yet they have
    an opportunity through this synastry aspect to learn what they *can* value about
    themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the Chiron individual, Venus will touch on the pain that they *already *hold,
    either from childhood or from previous relationships. This can be immensely triggering
    for the Chiron individual but offers them an opportunity to heal this long-held
    pain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many astrologers believe that Venus-Chiron aspects are extremely common in the
    charts of married couples. While I *sometimes* see these aspects appear for married
    partners, this is definitely not always the case. In my experience, these aspects
    can be incredibly painful *or* healing but don’t necessarily indicate whether
    or not a relationship will be a success. Much of the outcome will depend on how
    much work the Chiron person has done and how willing they are to confront their
    own insecurities.

- en: Venus Conjunct Chiron Synastry
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus conjunct Chiron synastry aspect can be a tough placement. In this
    relationship, the Venus individual triggers the Chiron person’s wound through
    the way they love, their personal taste/aesthetic, or the way that they think
    and act around money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some way, the Venus person triggers the Chiron’s person sense of inadequacy
    around love. This probably stems from childhood or past relationships, but it
    makes the Chiron person feel (subconsciously) that they do not deserve love. It
    reminds them that they don’t have enough *value*. Of course, this is not true,
    but it certainly *feels* to true to the Chiron person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Chiron individual may find that they feel a strange sense of inadequacy
    around the Venus person. They might not know exactly *why*, but they somehow feel
    that they don’t measure up. This is because all of the feelings they have about
    their Chironic wound are magnified in the presence of the Venus individual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But how does this play out? If the Chiron person has not even begun to confront
    their wound, then they’re likely to lash out. In the most extreme examples, the
    Chiron person will want to hurt the Venus person or bring them down to try and
    “fix” their own negative feelings. They might also try to change the values of
    the Venus individual to make them less threatening.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, for a Chironic individual who *has* worked on their sense of inadequacy
    in this area, the relationship can be an opportunity to grow. In fact, this can
    be an *incredibly* healing relationship if Chiron is able to get past the more
    subconscious feelings that pop up and make them conscious in order to sort through
    their own emotions and experiences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless, the Venus conjunct Chiron synastry relationship will probably be
    a bit painful for both individuals (Chiron because of the triggers and Venus due
    to Chiron’s reactions) but can also be very healing if both people are emotionally
    mature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this aspect is dealt with in a developed manner, a wonderful relationship
    may flourish. Both people will understand the other’s pain and know how to soothe.
    However, immature handling of this aspect can lead to a toxic or critical relationship
    as well as a variety of unhealthy coping mechanisms from one or both individuals.

- en: Venus Trine Chiron Synastry
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This relationship can feel “meant to be” when the couple first meets. There
    is a sense of healing, at least for the wounded individual in the Venus trine
    Chiron synastry relationship, because they feel as though Venus provides all the
    love they’ve always wanted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Something about the Venus person helps the Chiron person deal with their wound.
    The Venus individual may present themselves a certain way or even show love a
    certain way. Regardless, the Venus individual smoothes the rough edges of the
    Chironic wound and makes the Chiron individual feel *whole, *at least at the beginning
    of the relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the Venus trine Chiron synastry aspect can make for a very healing relationship
    that *feels* fated, it isn’t always truly fated. Sometimes, the trine makes the
    Chiron person lean on the Venus person to feel whole. They may start to believe
    that they can’t live without the individual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a healthy relationship, the Venus trine Chiron synastry aspect simply smoothes
    the edges of the Chironic wound and teaches both people how to love *with* boundaries.
    It takes two mature individuals to create this kind of relationship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In an unhealthy context, the Venus trine Chiron synastry aspect can create a
    very codependent relationship. Venus can sometimes be a superficial planet, and
    in this context, Venus is able to keep Chiron *superficially* happy, yet the wound
    still exists. Chiron may start to think that they can’t live without Venus. However,
    no one is happy in this dependent type of relationship. Chiron is also unable
    to fully deal with their wounds and uses Venus like a bandaid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, the Venus trine Chiron synastry aspect makes two individuals feel *tied*
    to each other in a deeper way, but they struggle to be logical and to clearly
    express themselves. They have trouble being *individuals*. It is essential that
    both people work on their own wounds and share their findings with each other
    instead of expecting the other person to fix their wounds for them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This relationship can occasionally end up failing because either Chiron or Venus *needs*
    to break away from the other in order to find themselves. This is even *more*
    painful for the other person but is also an opportunity (again) to actually look
    at the wound and heal. However, it *is* possible for this relationship to work,
    but it requires very open emotional communication.

- en: Venus Sextile Chiron Synastry
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus sextile Chiron synastry aspect is much softer than the previous two.
    In this relationship, there is an opportunity for the Chiron person to heal their
    love-related issues, or at the very least to acknowledge *where* their insecurities
    lie.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though the Venus sextile Chiron relationship in synastry can be mildly triggering
    for the Chiron individual, it’s also quite healing. The Venus person naturally
    provides love in a way that allows Chiron to see what they *didn’t* have in past
    relationships or with their parents. This previous *lack* of love created the
    insecurities, the sense of worthlessness, that the Chiron individual deals with,
    but the Venus person is able to fill some of those holes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this relationship won’t solve all the issues for Chiron, it does give
    them a chance to step into the light and figure out how they truly feel about
    themselves, to do things differently going forward. Of course, this requires that
    Chiron is *ready* to do the work. If the Chiron individual would rather ignore
    their insecurities then this aspect may be completely inactive.
  prefs: []

- en: Venus Opposition Chiron Synastry
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus opposition Chiron synastry aspect indicates that the Venus person
    will trigger the Chiron person’s wound, again and again. Typically, the *way*
    that the Venus person expresses love or how they conduct relationships is what
    triggers the wound.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there may be other “Venusian” qualities that trigger Chiron, such as
    how much money Venus makes or how they express beauty. Regardless, something about
    the way that the Venus individual expresses these qualities brings out all of
    the worst insecurities in Chiron.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chiron is usually seeing the shadow self in Venus, or who they *wish* they were.
    Venus reminds them of the qualities that they feel they *lack*, which makes them
    believe that they do not have value. Even if Chiron does not consciously realize
    this, they are likely to act out due to these unconscious emotions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a romantic relationship, the Venus opposition Chiron synastry aspect is difficult
    to overcome unless the Chiron individual is ready to do some serious emotional
    work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Venus opposition Chiron synastry *actually* means that the Chiron
    person is triggered by who the Venus person chooses to love. This is more apparent
    in a friendship, and may not even be activated until the Venus person enters into
    a romantic relationship; the energy of this relationship changes what Venus and
    Chiron have together. This is not always the case but is certainly a possibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect can *also* be a bit competitive in some ways. Chiron may feel that
    they always have to measure up to Venus or compete with what Venus does, looks
    like, or the possessions that Venus has.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many ways that the Venus opposition Chiron synastry aspect can trigger
    the Chiron individual, and all of them are Venusian. The most important thing
    to realize is that Chiron is essentially seeing in Venus what they feel they *lack*.
    It’s not OK with them to lack this but makes them feel that they lack value overall.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the Venus opposition Chiron synastry aspect is quite difficult emotionally,
    it’s also a good chance for the Chiron individual to confront that shadow in themself
    and to learn how to be OK with themself exactly as they are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Venus Square Chiron Synastry
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the opposition aspect indicates that Chiron sees the shadow self, the
    Venus square Chiron synastry aspect is more of a *conflict* or difference in viewpoint
    (instead of the opposite).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, this means that the way the Venus person loves is simply not what
    the Chiron person needs to feel secure and to heal. This is very painful for the
    Chiron person because Venus repeatedly triggers the square by not loving them
    in the way they need. Venus may make Chiron feel more insecure because they just
    can’t understand where Venus is coming from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Venus square Chiron synastry aspect can also mean that Chiron is triggered
    by the way Venus spends/earns money, the way they look, or any of the Venusian
    qualities that they present. Something about Venus makes Chiron feel insecure.
    Chiron may feel that no matter how hard they try, they can’t seem to calm down
    their feelings of inadequacy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a friendship or familial relationship, Venus square Chiron can have another
    meaning. Sometimes, this aspect indicates that the Venus person is attracted to
    or dates people who trigger the Chiron individual. In this case, the Venus person’s
    method of love triggers Chiron indirectly, through their partners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect is generally about Venus triggering all sorts of inadequacy in the
    Chiron person. The energy of this relationship can be very disconnected because
    these two just cannot understand each other. Typically, Chiron does not know how
    to explain these triggers to Venus (not that Venus would necessarily understand)
    so the matter remains conflicted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If both people are willing, the Venus square Chiron synastry aspect *can* be
    resolved, but it takes a lot of communication. This aspect isn’t necessarily bad
    but simply indicates that these two relational styles don’t match up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, both partners will stay together because Chiron feels the need to
    prove that they *are* good enough, despite the constant pain they endure by being
    around Venus. Other times, Chiron feels the need to disconnect or flee.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s very important that both partners are willing to dig *deep* into their
    emotional psyches *and* willing to learn how to explain their emotions in a way
    that the other can understand for this relationship to last.
