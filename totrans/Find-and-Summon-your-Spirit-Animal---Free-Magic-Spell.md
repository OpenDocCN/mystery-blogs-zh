**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Paper

*   Pen

*   Stuffed animals: fox, wolf, lion, deer, monkey, snake, bear, bird, horse,

*   Water

 Take the pen and paper. Out of the following list, write down one of these traits that you are (tell the truth of it will not work): smart, caring, adventurous, risky, quick, friendly, quiet, thoughtful, humble. Make sure you write down just one! Now fold this paper up and hold up the glass of water to the sunlight and chant this:

"O great Spirit Animal
Thy come to me
Greatness for me
In you I see
Best come quick
Show much haste
Into my heart
For you I shall not waste
I bow down to you,
My trait be (insert trait here)
Depend on me
For it is you, Spirit Animal,
That I seek."

Now drink the glass of water. Go back inside. Get all of your stuffed animals and line them up. Place the folded paper in front of them and write on the paper, "To My Spirit Animal". Then chant this:

"Fox of smarts, it could be
Or the caring horse is me
Perhaps the adventurous bear
Or the risky snake,
The lion of haste
The friendly wolf
Or the quiet deer
The thoughtful monkey,
Who dare not sneer
Maybe the humble bird
Winning without a word
Who could it be?
We shall see..."

Now go to sleep, and while you are falling asleep focus on your trait. In your dream, the animal will show up somewhere (most likely near you). The might talk to you, or might not. Remember the animal. This is your spirit animal.

This is not how you connect with a spirit guide, this might help someone create the illusion of a spirit guide, but you need to go through a spiritual journey to actually meet your guide. You cannot go into it going ''I really like foxes'' because you will discover you connect with foxes, not through spiritual reasons, but from reasoning biases.
