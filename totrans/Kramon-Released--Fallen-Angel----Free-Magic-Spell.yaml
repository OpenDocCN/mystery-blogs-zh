    makes way more sense lol. Got to say, this is a new one for me, I applaud their
    imagination.
  id: totrans-55
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously need to say it, but this is fake. That said, why would a fallen angel
    become a shadow hedgehog holding a cythe that's half evil? Once you're cast out
    of heaven the grim reaper recruits you? Also candle formation is what makes him
    both good and bad without turning on you why? He also into fung shui?

    Yes it appears of this form so I go with it. Believe it or not no reason to waste

- en: The demonic entity can and might be real, but it's name isn't Kramon. Remember
    that demons can appear in all sorts of shapes, they can take shapes that you do
    not even believe, my friend. During a ritual a snake turned into a dark figure
    outside my pentagram and I still haven't managed to find out what demon it was.

- en: Well, there are more demons than you can think of. People only reincount the
    powerful, while there are a lot that people have not encounted or read in the
    bible. Those are top rate demons being the first demon, princes of hell and so
    forth. You think thats all that populates hell? Well, i will leave you to your
    ignorance Theurgic.
  id: totrans-59

- en: Seriously... What is this? There is no such thing as a demonic entity called
    'Kramon'. There is no fallen angel called 'Kramon'. Get off your ass and go read
    some REAL books about magic. Magic isn't a game, dude. You can't just create an
    entity that doesn't even exist. Why did you even do this spell?

    gagged. this is just someone playing pretend and wanting to look cool, just kindly
    explain why this is fake and move on, don't get too riled up over it or you'll
    have a bad time.
  id: totrans-61

- en: Actually ''Theurgic'' nobody knows all the demons and angels so this could be
    a fallen angel (it is probably not though) To the author of this ritual I recommend
    studying already discovered angels and demons and not wastig time chasing and
    summoning imaginary demons. Also the demon can appear in any form it could be
    a chicken (demons usually are in forms of just a shadow because they are too powerful
    to be in their true form. IF and I am repeating IF he is true and you really did
    see him in your dreams then you need to get as many protection spells as possible
    because the demon might be looking for a host/vessel and unless you really need
    his help, then I don't recommend doing it (I am speaking from experience). ''Fujin''
    please stop posting fake rituals please it is a real time waster

    hit yalls minds? We dont know every demon or angel or hybrid angel, demon, or
    just a hybrid. We dont know everything. Its not going to be in a book because
    it probably only appears to worthy people worth its time.
