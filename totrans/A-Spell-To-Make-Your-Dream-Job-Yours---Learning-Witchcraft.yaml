- en: Give your spell making skills some rest and refreshment in the 3 preceding dark
    days and do the spell on the night of the new moon. The brown candles will represent
    your dream job and burn the green candle, since the color represents prosperity.
    Finally, there’s a fourth candle that represents you or the person with whom the
    spell is being cast on behalf.

- en: Your magic will be more potent if the color associated with yours or the other
    person’s astrological sign. You should set aside an appropriate time for the spell
    since the candles should burn out completely rather than being extinguished. For
    the spell you need two brown candles, one personal candle, one green candle, an
    essential oil and incense associated with prosperity such as cinnamon or ginger.

- en: Start by anointing all the candles with the oils. Work them towards yourself
    if you’re casting the spell for your own needs but work away from you if you’re
    casting the spell for someone else. Place one of the brown candles at the center
    of your altar, with a green candle to the right and the personal one to the left.

    you should light up the second brown candle for nine minutes. Focus on the flame
    and meditate on the job you want or what you want the other person to get. Imagine
    how much better things will be when the spell works and believe it will actually
    work.
