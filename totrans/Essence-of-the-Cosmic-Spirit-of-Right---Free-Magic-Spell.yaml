    itself, and have used it successfully many times. The degree of efficacy of this
    method will vary between individuals, due to differences between individual souls.

    sounds (mentioned below), solitude, and dim lighting. Candle light or other fire
    light is preferable, but any dim lighting will suffice. Certain constant humming
    sounds, such as computer noise and refrigerator noise, are disruptive to the efficacy
    of the method. In contrast, certain quiet textured sounds, particularly the sound
    of rustling wind or whistling wind, improve the efficacy of the method. Certain
    woody smells, notably pine, can improve the efficacy of the method. Eliminate
    any sources of discomfort, such as excess heat or cold.'

    thoughts, and keep it cleared. Then, focus on the beauty of the darkness, quietness,
    and solitude. By getting a feel for that beauty, your soul is getting a grip upon
    the essence of the Cosmic Spirit of Right, which you can then pull in, which in
    turn produces a stronger feeling.'
