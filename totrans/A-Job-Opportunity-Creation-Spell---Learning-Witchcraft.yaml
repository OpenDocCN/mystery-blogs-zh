    be in Leo since the lion represents ferocity and forward momentum.

    then the silver candle.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let the candles burn for a short amount of time (about thirty seconds should
    do), and then remove the letter from the envelope. Leave the letter on the altar,
    and then hold the envelope to the silver flame. Se it in the fireproof dish, and
    let it burn down to ash. This is to signify the outgoing energy. You’re hoping
    for that letter from them, and with the silver candle you send that out to them.

- en: Once the envelope has fully burned down to ash, pick up the letter. Set it aflame
    using the gold candle, the candle representing the sun, the giver, and those gifts
    granted to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thank the spirits for the gifts they’ve given you and, hopefully, continue to
    give. Once the letter has been burned down to ash, sit back and meditate, pray,
    or otherwise align yourself with your spirituality as the candles burn down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The principle here is that as the candles burn down, the energy and thoughts
    are floating upon the wind, while the physical things holding you back are melting
    down with the wax.
