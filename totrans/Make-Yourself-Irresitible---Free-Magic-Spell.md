Do i need all the ingredients can't i just used the chant

you can use the chant, but I'm unsure how effective it would be [especially since you need to leave offerings to each of the deities you are calling upon] the bath with the honey is required as a way for you to soak in the energy and visualize your desired outcome, and the bundle is a charm to attract your desired outcome. you can change an item here and there in a spell and it still works, but removing 99% of it, I'm not sure how well it would work [but I'm more concerned calling on deities and not giving them an offering to say thanks]

This might cast a glamour and make you appear favourable to others. However, making yourself ''irresistible'' is not a thing a spell can do. There are better spells for this goal. Above all, calling on three deities you do not work with can be dangerous. If the deities do not get along, if you do not give them an offering, if you have never spoken to them before this is disrespectful. Aphrodite despised Circe, so calling on them to work together could result in one or both turning on you. At best, they will ignore you, at worst they will teach you a lesson.
