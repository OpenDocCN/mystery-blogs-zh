  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Quarter Guardians (often called Watchtowers) are used in a Circle to personify
    the elements (Earth, Fire, Air, and Water). Each is situated in its respective
    directional areas (North, South, East, and West). Each of the Guardians presides
    over its respective area. They split the Circle into four quarters and help to
    give the Circle its strength.
  prefs: []

    to use a colored candle for each. It is also possible to use something else such
    as crystals, or even something that directly relates to the direction of the Elements.
    Such as: incense for East, a bowl of water for West, salt for North, and a candle
    for South.'

    location. Neglect to do so will certainly affect the quality of any magick you
    will be undertaking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To start with it is a good idea to use a compass to make sure you get the exact
    directions of North, South, East, and West. Of course, once you have cast your
    Circle in this location a few times you will no longer need to check with the
    compass. Obviously when using a compass, make sure there are no strong magnetic
    or metal influences within the area that might affect a true reading.

    In order they are ideas for candle colors, crystals, and tarot cards. There are
    many more options than those shown. Black Candles are used to ward off negativity,

    find a safe spot. Dig a hole big enough to put the bound item in. Pour the ashes
    of the burnt sage and rosemary over the bound item and close the hole. You have
    now reached the very last act to perform. It's called the ''libation to the Lord
    and Lady'' and is an important part of finishing the ritual. In a way it's giving
    something back to those who have given their time, love and energy to you.

    to it when you take into account of the necessary preparations and stages. But
    like so much else in this world, if it's worth doing, do it well. Having said
    that it can be adapted as you desire but don't pare it down too much. It is such
    an important ritual it deserves the effort that is made to perform it.

    However, that is not to say that you are forbidden to leave it. Sometimes the
    need will arise, whether it's a call of nature or something else entirely.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Standing in the East, take the athame and literally cut a doorway shape in the
    air. Walk through the doorway you have created in the Circle (taking the athame
    with you). Once you have exited the Circle, turn and, facing the circle, use the
    athame to close the opening. This will seal the circle so that nothing can enter
    or leave while you are gone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you return to the circle, it is important that you follow the same procedure.
    Cut a doorway in the circle, step through, and close it again with the athame.
