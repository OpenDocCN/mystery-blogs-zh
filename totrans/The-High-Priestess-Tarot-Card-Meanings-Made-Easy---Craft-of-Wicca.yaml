    dressing up like a man and being elected to the position of pope.

    her feet, the [triple goddess symbol](https://craftofwicca.com/wiccan-symbols-and-meanings-general-and-specific/)
    on her head, pomegranates in the background, black and white pillars with B and
    J, and Torah in hand.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The B and J stand for Boaz and Jachin. It’s a reference to the first Temple
    of Jerusalem. In fact, once you know that, it’s easier to see the temple veil
    hanging in the back.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This gives a clear separation between her and others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the longest time, I never realized they were pomegranates in the background.
    They can be taken literally since these appear at the Solomon Temple, but more
    likely, they were chosen to represent fertility (all the seeds).
  prefs: []

    the cards. It gets you in the habit of looking for specific details.

    the priestess works will remain a mystery. She also cloaked her identity in the
    oldest versions of the story.

    to the triple goddess to the temple.

    her *inner voice* and then answers people’s questions.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common reversed High Priestess meaning is secrecy, confusion, lost
    sense of self, and repression.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reversed cards often mean the opposite of the upright meaning. If you think
    of the high priestess as sharing her knowledge with the masses, then keeping things
    secret and repressed is the opposite meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be a bit harder to remember that the card can mean a lost sense of self
    or confusion in the proper context.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The High Priestess has a clear divine intuition. Her inner voice is clear, and
    the reversed card has her lose her sense of self. She is getting mixed signals,
    and it’s hard to tell which is true and which is false.

    symbolism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is that every person will have different decks, and so it’s
    good to learn how to go with your gut on what you see. This is the best way to
    have a good interpretation for the moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too many people stick to a learned reading instead of going with the flow. Remember,
    each reading, deck, person, position, and the question is different. Reading the
    cards is an art, not a science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll use a different deck for every one of these. Today’s is the [Fountain
    Tarot](https://amzn.to/34vbyAY). I love how this deck abstracts the images without
    straying too far from traditional symbolism.

    in multiple places.

- en: The crescent moon at her feet has become her chair. The veil in the back has
    become much more prominent. The moon hat has become the moon in the sky.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Her face indicates the mysterious nature much better here. She seems to be in
    a pool of water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Water tends to represent divination, which is another way to explain what the
    card is all about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s interesting that the scroll is rolled up. We can’t tell what’s in it. She
    has the information to consult, but she isn’t using it just yet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to the High Priestess.

    things to look out for.

    like your job or finances or hobby or relationships, then the High Priestess will
    indicate to turn inward about it.

    High Priestess appears, it can be trusted.

    topic.
  prefs: []

    card representing a person can mean that the person is enshrouded in mystery.
