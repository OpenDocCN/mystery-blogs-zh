- en: Heat the spring water in the bowl or pot over the burner until the water is
    boiling hot. Add the star anise as you say "Let all negativity be deflected from
    this place". Now add the bay leaf as you say "As the scent of this leaf moves
    around this place, may it become a purified sacred space". Add the sage as you
    say " Through sage, I now make this spell manifest. That with peace and protection,
    this space is blessed".

    should work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I agree, this does indeed ring as an effective process. All of the herbs used
    are related with clearing and protection, and should be pungent enough to carry
    into the air well from the simmer.

- en: As a note on the affirmations, they are pretty good as well. Though I would
    worry less about making them whyme and just use whatever wording that I resonated
    with in the moment and followed the intent of the working. That's just personal
    preference though.
