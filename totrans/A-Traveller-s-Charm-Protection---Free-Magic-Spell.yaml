    plane, then this is the perfect working.

    if possible, or if you know what the plane you are flying on looks like, visualise
    it in your mind.

    often than not you feel slightly cold.

    of the plane inside your mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When this has been done then visualise the plane in gold energy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coat every corner and area of the plane in it. I say to use gold, because gold
    is the strongest colour, it also protects and brings the person using it good
    luck.

- en: Then take hold of Kenaz and Raidho (if you are uncomfortable with closing your
    eyes in a crowded place, you can keep them open so long as you can keep yourself
    in a trance like this) vibrate them in your mind, or you can mutter them.

    did not want to look as though I was even more insane than what I already am.
