- en: This is incantation for Binding your circle. When a Circle is bound, each of
    the Circle members powers are linked so more than one witch from the Circle would
    have to be focusing on the spell at hand for it to take action. A binding ceremony
    is a powerful ritual that is able to bind the magic of a witch, to their coven,
    by suppressing their power.

    the forces of darkness. When evil assails us, when fear weakens us, when descent
    threatens us, in the circle we will find our power. We come to this place alone,
