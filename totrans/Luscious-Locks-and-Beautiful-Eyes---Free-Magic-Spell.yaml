    a flat surface. Then set your LIT candle in the center of the pentagram. Make
    your middle and index fingers touch one of the points on the pentagram, and have
    your other hand hovering above the candle. When you feel the heat from the candle
    going through your hand burn 2 of your flower petals in the flames, then say this
    spell 2x.
