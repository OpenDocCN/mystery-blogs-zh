    a vase. Pour some warm water into the vase, though not enough to drown the flowers.
    Place the vase on a square table somewhere in your home. At each corner - North,
    South, West, and East - recite the following:'

    ELYON, and by the name IAO, this thing is and shall be."'

    scrying, remote viewing, and so forth. No one will be able to use magic to look
    into your house, or even to discern its location, so long as the flowers are alive.
    When they wither, you will have to begin the spell again.

- en: Belladonna means "silence" in the language of flowers. It is also heavily associated
    with magic and beauty.
  prefs:

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Roses, while also being symbols of love, are also associated with Harpocrates,
    god of silence and secrets. Thus, in the language of flowers, roses have a secondary
    meaning of "secrecy" in addition to their more common meaning of "love."
  prefs:

- en: White roses are associated with purity, secrecy, silence, and innocence.
  prefs:

- en: This spell will also prevent remote viewing, scrying, etc. from inside the house,
    so keep that in mind before casting.

    is poisonous and therefore hard to come by unless you plan to grow it. Blue roses
    are incredibly rare unless these are dyed white roses. You can place food colouring
    in the water of a white flower and it will change the colour of the petals. I
    would consider growing roses and belladonna for protection and saying this chant
    while watering them. Plants can be a line of defense if you care for them with
    intention.
