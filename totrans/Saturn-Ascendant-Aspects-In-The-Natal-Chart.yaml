- en: In the natal chart, Saturn aspects to the Ascendant dictate how serious and
    responsible you appear. When your Ascendant is influenced by Saturn, you can seem
    conservative, bland, closed-off, uptight, or simply business-like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After all, Saturn is all about restrictions. These aspects will typically *restrict*
    your Ascendant from totally shining through, though they can be helpful or difficult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn-Ascendant aspects, you may struggle to show your true emotions or
    even your inner self. You might feel stuck behind the repressive, Saturnian mask.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, people with these aspects are true old souls, while others might
    distant or aloof. There are both benefits and difficult parts of these Saturn-Ascendant
    aspects!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any of these aspects are relatively painful, especially when compared to other
    Ascendant aspects, yet they help you work through your Saturn in relationship
    to the outside world, too.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    at least outwardly. You may come across as especially solemn or austere and repress
    some of the emotions that you feel inside.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn conjunct Ascendant doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re shy, although
    you may have felt a bit repressed socially as a child. Usually, this is something
    you grow out of as you age.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this aspect *does* mean that you have a misplaced sense of responsibility.
    You probably feel responsible for your family members or friends, even if their
    problems aren’t your fault.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn conjunct Ascendant can also mean that your parents placed a lot of responsibility
    on you from a young age, although this isn’t always the case. In this scenario,
    you learned that other people’s issues *were* your problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, you feel that it is your duty to “fix” things. You probably experience
    a huge amount of guilt if you try to ignore these issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also feel that you struggle to take risks. You’re always playing it
    safe or hesitating socially. This doesn’t mean that you don’t engage in risky
    behaviors, but simply that you don’t go after the things you *really* want because
    you’re afraid to try.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn conjunct Ascendant, you may feel that the Universe holds you back
    in life. It can start to seem like your whole existence revolves around the concept
    of “one step forward, two steps back.” Keep in mind that the Saturn conjunct Ascendant
    aspect transforms greatly after your first Saturn return.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you grow older, simple problems can start to feel complicated and heavy.
    You carry around a lot of responsibility, but this can start to overwhelm you.
    It’s sometimes easier to just avoid your problems, but then you’re left with a
    vague sense of guilt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn conjunct Ascendant, it’s really important that you actively deal
    with your problems instead of avoiding them. Work is the best antidote, however
    you need to make sure that you’re working on something that feels right in your
    gut. Don’t do a task just because you feel like you “should.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t leave things until the last minute because they can build up and cause
    depression. In fact, loneliness or pessimism, resulting in depression, is common
    with Saturn conjunct Ascendant. These are things that you need to actively work
    to improve so that you can eventually lead a happier, more peaceful life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important that you spend time working on your self-confidence. You may
    feel that you’re never enough, but this comes from a sense of inner guilt. Others
    can’t see that this is why you will go out of your way to help someone. You must
    learn how to do what’s good for *you*, not what other people want you to do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have a lot of fear and apprehension about living in the moment. You try
    not to react, so you may come off as slightly cold during conflicts, but this
    is because your Saturn restricts your emotions from shining through.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn conjunct Ascendant, you may also feel a bit restricted physically,
    as though you’re out of place in your body. This aspect can make you feel very
    self-conscious about your appearance. In fact, your appearance can be karmic,
    so you’re always struggling against it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a child, you may have been shy or felt out of place. You probably felt awkward
    or *wrong* in your body and tried to avoid expressing your emotions. It was almost
    like you just couldn’t break through, no matter how hard you tried.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t lose hope! Saturn is always a late bloomer, so you will find that these
    issues change dramatically as you near your first Saturn return. You can learn
    how to *master* these very things that caused so much trouble for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learn to take responsibility for *yourself* and do those daily tasks that make
    you *feel* in your gut. Avoidance is the worst thing for you, but you need to
    make sure that you’re actively focusing on what you want, not what others want.
    This will help you grow socially, too, and you will learn to accept your body
    and your place in life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn conjunct Ascendant, each small *personal* success that you have
    will build your self-confidence. This aspect takes time to heal, but it can eventually
    make you very responsible for yourself and dedicated to living your happiest,
    truest life, even publicly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will start to notice that you feel a sense of guilt for *yourself* when
    you do too much for others. This is a sign that you are betraying yourself and
    is where much of your depression and anxiety stems from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learn to follow your gut instincts to heal Saturn conjunct Ascendant. Focus
    on what feels right instead of what you “should” do. There are no “shoulds” with
    Saturn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, you will start to relax and learn these lessons naturally. Saturn
    feels much less strict as you age, but you also have to push yourself to face
    your fears and figure out solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is lots of potential for transformation with Saturn conjunct Ascendant!
    Ultimately, you can live a life of peace where you’re totally responsible for
    your own needs. With this aspect, you really can create the life you want long-term
    with a bit of effort.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn trine Ascendant, you appear restrained around other people. You
    almost always control your reactions, so other people don’t see what you truly
    think or feel unless you want them to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may be quite reserved. Saturn trine Ascendant means that you appear serious
    and disciplined, thought it may be hard for other people to see who you truly
    are beneath this mask.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Others don’t see *any* outward impulsivity in your personality. Sometimes, you
    can even be a bit hard to get to know, because you’re not the best at small talk.
    These are skills you can learn over time; they don’t come naturally at a young
    age.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn trine Ascendant, you can sometimes seem closed off, mainly because
    your reactions are *so* private. Your disposition is very serious, but you can
    sometimes seem a little bland or empty because you never show people who you are
    underneath.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to learn how to express yourself better in order to be *respected.*
    People don’t usually dislike you, but they aren’t drawn to you either because
    you hide who you are. This is instinctual for you; it feels unnatural to show
    yourself to the outside world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Saturn trine Ascendant can make it difficult for you to forge relationships.
    You’re simply *so* careful, even as a child, but this can make other people a
    bit nervous.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to relax and show your playful side. This can be really difficult for
    you because it feels natural to hide who you are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the way that you think can also be a bit rigid. You might be a tad
    judgmental and see others as right or wrong, the world as black or white. Over
    time, you need to learn how to appreciate different viewpoints so that you don’t
    alienate people when you do open up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Saturn trine Ascendant aspect is one of the more difficult trine aspects.
    Even though it’s instinctive, like all trines, it also creates a lot of social
    issues that are hard to undo.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, you need to learn how to be more vulnerable with people. You will
    come to discover what a conversational rhythm means and will know that when someone
    else shares something, it’s your turn to share back.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be really scary to open yourself up to judgment and criticism. However,
    you’re mainly afraid of this because *you* tend to judge and criticize others
    so much. When you work on these qualities, you will come to realize that other
    people aren’t as critical and will most likely accept who you are, when you’re
    able to show them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will also learn that even if someone judges you, there’s no reason to feel
    badly as long as you were being your truest, authentic self. These skills will
    become more natural the close you get to your Saturn return, if you’re actively
    working towards a resolution.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn sextile Ascendant, you’re outwardly serious and independent. Regardless
    of your childhood circumstances, you had to learn responsibility in *some* way
    at a very young age.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the trine, these qualities didn’t come naturally to you with the sextile.
    Instead, you went through life events that *taught* you to become responsible
    and even a bit austere. You become independent at a young age; others can now
    see this reflected in your outer personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Saturn sextile Ascendant can make you feel like an outcast. You may
    have a small number of friends or close partnerships, but you value loyalty, so
    you would prefer to have only a few people in your close circle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The relationships that you develop may surround your shared work goals, routines,
    or sense of responsibility. Alternatively, your relationships are based on sorrow
    or guilt that you experienced in your early life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although you’re very self-reliant, you do want a few key people around you.
    You must be able to count on them and you will give the same back. You desire
    very serious friendships and romantic partnerships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Others around you can see that you’re responsible, sensible, and direct. You
    don’t beat around the bush. That doesn’t mean that everyone is privy to your inner
    thoughts as you keep those very guarded, but they can see these outer elements
    of your personality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re very strong-willed and know what you want. This is because, in childhood,
    you had to fight for what you needed. Saturn sextile Ascendant makes you someone
    truly respectable as an adult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you need to be careful that you don’t become too self-reliant or rigid.
    Learn to bend a little, even when it doesn’t feel totally comfortable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn sextile Ascendant can easily make you *too* serious. Don’t lose your
    sense of play. Remember to let your inner child out sometimes! Not *everything*
    that you do needs a good reason; sometimes you should try an activity just for
    fun.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You keep things very serious and business-like with the people around you. This
    can be a great skill, but it’s also important that you learn to open up to those
    closest to you. Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable, although this can be extra-difficult
    with Saturn sextile Ascendant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or Saturn setting. This aspect generally affects your relationships, but you will
    see these qualities show up *most* in your one-on-one friendships and romantic
    partnerships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, the Saturn opposition Ascendant aspect indicates that you didn’t receive
    enough praise or encouragement as a child. Now, you may be less-than-assertive
    and might doubt yourself. Any challenge can seem too intimidating or hard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may attract strict father figures as romantic partners, regardless of the
    gender roles. In fact, your relationships probably have some kind of parental
    role and may be unbalanced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is because you don’t feel that you have the capability to be responsible
    foe your own life, so you attract people who will take over the role of controlling
    you and your life. However, this doesn’t work in the long run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you might be the “responsible,” strict partner in relationships.
    In this scenario, you attract lovers who are more immature or even physically
    young. You feel responsible for them and they allow you to take over these duties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, Saturn opposition Ascendant can mean that you’re scared of relationships
    in general because you don’t want to be vulnerable. You may have experienced negative
    events in past relationships, either with ex-partners or even with your parents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saturn opposition Ascendant usually indicates that relationships are a core
    part of your shadow-work. You will discover who you are underneath by working
    through your issues in partnerships and friendships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This aspect will force you into difficult relationships with people who teach
    you these lessons. The key to healing Saturn opposition Ascendant is to learn
    how to accept others for who they are while *also* accepting your shadow self
    and setting clear boundaries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, you need to own *all* parts of yourself. With Saturn opposition
    Ascendant, you probably attract people who reflect your shadow self. In fact,
    your partners have the very negative qualities that you suppress within yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you learn to own and express these hidden qualities, you will start to
    attract relationships where you can be yourself authentically with partners who
    want the same type of relationship that you do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    After all, you only grow with this placement *through* relationships.

    learning lessons and getting close to fulfillment when you simply keep trying.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Saturn square Ascendant, you experienced some less-than-stellar circumstances
    in childhood. You either had intensely strict rules, physical or verbal abuse,
    or you were emotionally scarred by rules at your school. Sometimes, this placement
    reflects a combination of all three circumstances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In your childhood, you felt that you couldn’t control your environment no matter
    how hard you tried. When you eventually realized that your efforts were fruitless,
    you retreated into yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now with Saturn square Ascendant, you’re probably a bit reserved when you meet
    new people. This might actually annoy you, because you know that you’re not portraying
    your truest self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was learned in childhood. You couldn’t express yourself openly for fear
    of punishment or retaliation in some environment, whether this was with your parents,
    teachers, or other children. Your natural enthusiasm was tempered with rules and
    limitations; you had to hide the truest parts of yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These lessons are very hard to unlearn! You may find that no matter how much
    you want to show your truest self to other people, Saturn square Ascendant keeps
    the inner you totally hidden.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also felt very serious or responsible as a child. In some way, you were
    responsible or other people or had a lot of weight on you. This taught you that,
    with Saturn square Ascendant, it’s your job to take care of things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These lessons make you even more inhibited or shy! It’s especially difficult
    for you to interact when you first meet someone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because you have this Saturn square Ascendant aspect, others tend to react negatively
    to you, too. You may come off as too rigid or even pessimistic, even if you’re
    trying your hardest to be outgoing and optimistic. You clam up and just can’t
    break free of your bonds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will feel especially repressed in childhood. The Saturn square Ascendant
    aspect is the *most* tough before your first Saturn return.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may take some time to develop your social skills and confidence in groups,
    but it’s important that you actively work to learn these skills. Don’t ever think
    that you’re just not outgoing; you simply don’t have the same skills that other
    people are born with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, you will figure out how to show more of your inner self and take
    social risks. This will happen when you’re willing to open up and try. It’s very
    scary to be vulnerable with Saturn square Ascendant, but this is the path to healing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that everything was out of control as a child, so you like to stay in areas you
    have *complete* control over now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Be OK with everything that happens, even if it feels bad. Remember that you can’t
    have *good* things without the equal and opposite *bad* thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    by getting to the roots of your childhood trauma and recognizing your responses

    they force you to deal with these issues.
