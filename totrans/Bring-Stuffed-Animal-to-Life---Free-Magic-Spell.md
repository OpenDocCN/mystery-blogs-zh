This cant work because it is impossible to bring something or a dead person to life even through Magic.

Try saying that to Necromancy

Necromancers work with spirits, they don't bring people back from the dead either.

hey , Jackia_Sunde !! if you had a bit more knowledge you would know what necromancy is and you would know not to pick fights online.

You cannot bring an inanimate object to life. You can enchant it to be a protection ward, but it will not be alive.
