Secret Grimoire

## Agate – It’s Meaning and Benefits

Agate is a banded, semiprecious gemstone. A form of microcrystalline quartz, agate colours include black, blue, brown, grey, green, orange, pink, purple, red, white, and yellow. Most agates have multiple colours that are structured into wavy bands, flowing patterns, or concentric designs.

Agate has a long history of use. The Sumerians and Mesopotamians used agate to make beads and ceremonial axe heads. Ancient Egyptians fashioned agate into amulets and the Minoans of Crete and Mycenaeans of mainland Greece used these stones for jewellery, as did the Romans, who were especially fond of agate for signet rings. Throughout the middle ages, the crystal was highly valued as a good luck charm.

## Spells Featuring Agate

### An All-purpose Self Healing Ritual

This is an excellent ritual for beginners or those who haven’t worked with crystal healing before. This ritual is also an awesome way of linking crystals with your own self-healing.

**You will need:**

*   One crystal of your choice
*   An undisturbed room or space

**Method**

*   Step 1 – Choose a crystal for the ritual. You can intuitively select a crystal by passing your hand over your collection and seeing which crystal you feel drawn to or you can choose a crystal that correspondences to your issue or question from a list of [crystal correspondences](https://wiccanow.com/crystal-correspondences/).
*   Step 2 – Hold the [cleansed](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-cleanse-your-crystals-6-no-fuss-tips-and-tricks/) and [charged crystal](https://wiccanow.com/how-to-charge-your-crystals-15-fantastic-tips/) in your open cupped hands. Name whatever it is you want to lose, for example, a fear, pain, symptoms of a chronic condition or a migraine. As you hold the stone, imagine it getting heavier and heavier as it becomes filled with the pain, fear or condition you wish to lose.
*   Step 3 – When the stone begins to feel too heavy to hold, wash it under running water and visualise your negative feelings or pain being rinsed away. If the stone is too delicate to wash with water, pass an incense stick over it and imagine the smoke dispersing your negative emotions or pain.
*   Step 4 – Keep the crystal in a place where a light will shine on it. Repeat the ritual as many times as needed. You may need to repeat many times if the condition is ongoing. Stay patient and always use the same crystal.
