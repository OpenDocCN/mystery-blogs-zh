    – the type of books that you want to read, crammed full of the information you
    want to know.

    that helps me improve existing books, as well as coming up with ideas for new
    ones.

    books. For those of you interested, you'll be provided with a digital version
    of one of my books, completely free of charge, for you to download and read at
    your leisure. All I ask in return is that you spend a few minutes to leave an
    honest review on Amazon.

    the best possible book, reviews are also a great way for new readers to discover
    my work. For a small independent author like myself, reader reviews have the potential
    to keep me in business. That''s why you should support all your favorite authors
    by leaving an honest review when you''ve enjoyed a good book.'
