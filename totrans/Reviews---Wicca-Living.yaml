    that helps me improve existing books, as well as coming up with ideas for new
    ones.

  zh: 不过，要实现这一点，我需要观众的帮助。您的反馈帮助我改善现有的书籍，同时也为新作品提供了创意。

    books. For those of you interested, you'll be provided with a digital version
    of one of my books, completely free of charge, for you to download and read at
    your leisure. All I ask in return is that you spend a few minutes to leave an
    honest review on Amazon.

- en: 'Full disclosure: while I read every one of my reviews in an attempt to produce
    the best possible book, reviews are also a great way for new readers to discover
    my work. For a small independent author like myself, reader reviews have the potential
    to keep me in business. That''s why you should support all your favorite authors
    by leaving an honest review when you''ve enjoyed a good book.'

  zh: 完全透明披露：虽然我会阅读每一条评论，以期出版最优秀的书籍，但评论也是新读者发现我的作品的好方式。对于像我这样的小型独立作者，读者评论可能使我继续留在业内。这就是为什么当您喜欢一本好书时，应该留下诚实的评论来支持所有您喜欢的作者。
