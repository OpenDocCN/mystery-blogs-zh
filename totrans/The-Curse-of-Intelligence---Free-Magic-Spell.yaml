- en: These are all questions I have been asking myself now, but whenever I tried
    to ask people these questions, they either blew me off or thought I was suicidal,
    but never actually understood what I was saying, and I think I have finally figured
    out why. They aren't intelligent enough to comprehend these questions. I do not
    proclaim myself to be the most intelligent person there is, I am just stating
    a fact. In all honesty, I would rather be in their shoes, living life happy and
    normal. But I am to intelligent to live that type of life. I know that there are
    other people like me. That is why it is called the curse of intelligence. I may
    sound naive, but I think that if we banded together, we would be able to actually
    figure out those things and finally break this curse of knowing that everything
    we do is meaningless.

    you off because they don't wanna deal with that. I personally hate philosophical
    questions.
