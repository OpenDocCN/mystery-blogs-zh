- en: Marriage spells just like love spells are really tricky and must be performed
    with care and tact. This spell is not intended to be performed if you are someone
    who wishes to get married. It is for already married couples who want to make
    their marriages to last forever.

    \ name of your spouse and yourself on the petals. For example of you have written\
    \ your name on one petal you need to write your spouse\x92s name on the next petal.\
    \ Use black ink. Do this until you have filled the names on all petals. Then dip\
    \ these petals in rose water and lay them under your bed covers."

    Once you have arranged the rose petals under your bed covers light the jasmine
    candle or jasmine incense and turn out the lights. Say the following spell twice
    before you retire to bed for the night:'

    pillows. This can be performed once a month or once in two months depending on
    the current status of the relationship that the both of you share.

    your energy into the spell. I might also do this annually on your anniversary,
    or perhaps Beltain. Finally, right before bed sounds nice, but I would let the
    petals dry, or place them in a satchel to place under your bed because wet fresh
    petals and you'll be sleeping on them? Wet bed with stains is all I'm saying.
