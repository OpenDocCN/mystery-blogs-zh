 Combine 4 parts powdered sandalwood and 1 part powdered cinnamon. You should use enough to fill a small bowl. Walk out of your doorway, and out to the nearest sidewalk. If you're in an apartment or condo, go out of the building to the sidewalk.

As you walk back to your front door, sprinkle this powder behind you, and stop once you get inside your house. Forget about this ritual, and go about your life...over the next several days, you'll be pleasantly suprised.
