- en: A spell of my own invention, it came to me in a time of need. I use it when
    a person is standing in the way of my happiness. If someone is refusing to help
    you and you really feel that morally they should, go ahead and cast this. Its
    not so much black magic in my opinion, its more of a way to make someone understand
    you and get you both on the same page.

- en: The first line of this spell is the most important aspect of it. You need to
    ask for help with this task, it involves projecting your mind into that of another,
    so you will probably need a powerful energy to help you with that, unless you
    have a natural affinity for astral projection or telepathy. You should focus your
    energy on summoning a powerful spirit to aid you. I often repeat this part of
    the spell multiple times. Who you ask for help with your magic is entirely up
    to you.

    a circle of salt around yourself, lit some candles, put on some trance music,
    did it under a new moon etc however I think if you are in need of help from a
    spell now, do it while you have the energy to put into it.
