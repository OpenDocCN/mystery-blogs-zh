    him "Can I/We make a deal?" if he replies with yes you''re good. List the items
    you would like, (Ex:Protection, Mind Reading, Teleporting) once you''ve listed
    them ask him "What would you like from this deal?" he will list items that he
    will like, if you do not like the first choice ask for another. His main three
    are sleep possession, able to read your mind and see your pat, or taking your
    soul!'

    can't physically summon a being that only exist in a television show.

    it's a bad idea, he's my favourite character so don't at me!] i would of done
    this already if it was possible. at bet you can make a thoughtform or servature
    like Bill, but it won't be him sadly [Remember the universe is a hologram, reality
    is an illusion, buy gold byeeee]

    but you can't summon him [which is a shame because he's such a delightful fello]
