    With every sentence you write down, imagine those qualities being pulled from
    you and placed onto the paper. Fold it up and smile, realizing that the weight
    and anxiety you once felt is gone. Place the paper in the empty bowl and burn
    it. those thoughts are gone now.

    feel the characteristics you want absorb through your skin like the water into
    the piece of paper. Notice how bright and radiant you are, how luck will always
    be in your favour from now on.

    You can throw away the other wet piece, because the magic has done it job. Feel
    a light grow inside you as you clean up.
