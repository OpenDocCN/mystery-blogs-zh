 WHILE DOING THIS SPELL, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO. Constantly be saying in your head to the jar that you want it to protect you from other people's emotions.

First, take your incense and light it. Clear your head. When it is cleared, put the incense in the jar and say "clear" 10 times.

Second, put salt to fill about 1/4 of the jar.

Third, put the stem and rose petal in the mortar and pestle. Crush it until it is fine enough to slip through your fingers like sand. Then put it in the jar.

Fourth, pour the moon water into the jar.

After filling the jar, close it. Take your candle and light it. Seal the jar with the wax and let it dry. MAKE SURE YOU PUT STRONG INTENT INTO THIS STEP. 

Done! Keep this jar with you to protect yourself! Message me if you have any questions!

REMEMBER TO PUT STRONG INTENT IN!! It will not work if you don't. You can also make a spell jar for other people to give them!

Hello Author, How to get any 'charged moon water'? What is the best type of 'Stem' to make this spell more effective?
