    Yes, you will probably make a few enemies, but you will also make a lot of new
    friends, some of whom will open doors for you that up until now have remained
    firmly closed.

- en: There may be a rational explanation for everything under the Sun but sometimes
    even big-brained Aquarius finds it hard to understand what is going on and this
    seems to be one of those occasions. Switch off your mind for a bit and rely on
    your instincts.

- en: You can tackle even the toughest tasks with confidence now. Not only that but
    the adventurous side of your nature will come to the fore and you will find yourself
    doing things that make others think you’ve gone mad. Maybe you have, but is that
    so bad?

    job done could bring sizeable financial rewards. And you’re worth every penny.

    few weeks. Don’t listen to those who say you should aim lower – if anything you
    should be aiming even higher than you are now. Make it all or nothing!

    who would rather hear some comforting lies. One day in the not too distant future
    they will thank you for being honest with them. It’s always the best policy.

    about it over the next 48 hours, so calm down. You may also need to un-stress
    a loved one who has been getting worked up emotionally about the same issue.

    you are willing to adapt the more you will gain on every level. Some people have
    to be dragged kicking and screaming into the future. Don’t be one of them.

    cherished dreams are about to come true. Don’t worry if you have to give up something
    of sentimental value today – what replaces it will be fantastic.

    of ideas and passion. Make it your business today to surprise and delight the
    object of your affection. Do something they don’t expect. They’ll love you for
    it.

    One of your secrets may need extra protecting today as someone seems to be nosing
    around trying to find out what you’ve been up to. They must not be allowed to
    know.
