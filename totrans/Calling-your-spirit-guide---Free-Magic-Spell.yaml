- en: '*As a brief note, this spell is written as a formal, ritual-based casting.
    However portions can naturally be adapted to visualizations. Just as any verbal
    statements are what worked for me and best seen as guidelines. You can adapt the
    wording to suit your preferred language, cadence, or of course rhyme. Just be
    sure the words convey the calling in a form of request, and that they are in line
    with your desired intent.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1- Prepare by contemplating what you are wanting to summon and why. What is
    the goal of what you are calling to you. not just what you are wanting to summon,
    but why you are summoning it. Use this to choose your wording when you declare
    what you are calling for later, during the spell. For example there is a subtle
    difference between saying ''I search for my Spirit guide.'' and ''I search for
    my spirit guardian.''

- en: 2-gather what you need/use to cast a circle and call your corners. Also have
    four candles. votives/tea lights are fine, or colored candles if you have them-
    one for each basic element.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3- choose your place and lay your circle. Ideally this should be in a natural
    setting, but anywhere you have room to draw and close a circle will do. Just be
    sure it is private enough to avoid being disturbed. Draw and close your circle
    and call on your corners however you usually do, and seat yourself in your circle
    comfortably. Or of course see the example in the spell components section.

- en: 4- Set the four candles down in a row a short reach out in front of you. Take
    the first candle and move it directly in front of you. Light the candle, and declare
    this intent.

- en: '''''I light this lamp of spirit. May its light reach across to the plain of
    air. May it make contact and illuminate the passage between our worlds. I search
    for [the being you want to contact], may this light lead you to my presence.'''''
  prefs: []

- en: 5- repeat with the second light, making the same plea in the same wording except
    to the plain of fire. (''May its light reach across to the plain of fire.'') and
    again for earth and water, lighting each candle in turn. When finished this stage,
    all four candles should be burning, close together, and directly in front of you.
    You can arrange them however you want. I had them in a tight diamond, each element
    towards its respective corner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6- you can close your eyes, or look intently into the middle of the four flames
    so that when your eyes go out of focus their light starts to blend together. Either
    way visualize four bridges coming towards your location, each one lit by the corresponding
    candle.

- en: '''''May these lamps dispel the darkness, and light the way. May the light reach
    to the planes of the elements and to the realms of spirit that [the entity you
    are trying to call on] may come to me. I invite you before me. I ask for your
    presence to [state your intent and goal.IE; to become aware of your spirit guide,
    or call the presence of your guardian, or to gain specific knowledge/insight from
    or about a specific entity, etc]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The called entity may make itself known to you then and there, it may remain
    silent, to make itself known later. Or it may not come at all. Like any magic
    this depends on many things. The purpose of this spell is to declare your intent,
    and your goals, and to extend an invitation for an entity to come to you to help
    you meat that goal. If you are using this working to invite a specific known entity,
    this would be the time to do so by placing it outside the circle in front of you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do your best to keep expectations curbed. Especially with an open ended request
    like 'my spirit guide' as it will come in the image it is meant to, not in the
    image you want or guess or hope for. And if that form does not match your expectations
    you may skip over the sign of presence and miss entirely that you were successful.
    Instead do your best to be empty of assumption and be silent and still.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 8- After a time of silence and contemplation, or, if you are fortunate enough
    to gain some form of interaction and it is concluded, take a moment to return
    to your position of authority and magical thought and intent. When returned to
    focus, state; ''As the lantern fades, the paths shall close.'' then in one breath,
    blow out the four candles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this is being used to gain a connection to your guide or guardian, there
    is no need to dismiss the entity. If it was a specific entity like a god/goddess,
    then be thankful for its presence even if you felt nothing or had no inkling to
    it being there, and include a statement of asking the spirit to return to its
    rightful realm in peace before blowing out the candles. Then end the ritual by
    opening your circle and clearing it. If you included an offering you will want
    to take it to a natural place or setting if it isn't there already, and leave
    it behind. It is no longer yours.

    while editing some typo's. Where it says ''If you are using this working to invite
    a specific known entity, this would be the time to do so by placing it outside
    the circle in front of you. '' It should read ''If you are using this working
    to invite a specific known entity, and you have an offering to give, this would
    be the time to do so by placing it outside the circle in front of you.''
