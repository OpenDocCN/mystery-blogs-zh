> 来源：[https://teaandrosemary.com/moon-saturn-aspects-synastry/#0001-01-01](https://teaandrosemary.com/moon-saturn-aspects-synastry/#0001-01-01)

In astrology, Saturn is the serious, mature individual, while the Moon is the inner, emotional self. These two are virtual opposites, so in the synastry chart, Saturn-Moon aspects can be quite difficult.

However, these aspects are *great* for growth. If you see a Saturn-Moon aspect in your synastry chart with your partner, you’ll know that you have an opportunity to learn a lot from each other.

With any of these Saturn-Moon aspects, the Saturn person feels mature, serious, and reserved, while the Moon person can be over-emotional or childlike. It’s easy for the Saturn person to feel overwhelmed by the emotional nature of their partner, yet the Moon person can also feel emotionally oppressed.

Ultimately, these aspects are like relationship-glue. Even if both partners are unhappy, they’re often drawn to stay together. Saturn creates long-term relationships. However, the success of the relationship will depend on the emotional maturity of both people.

Any Moon-Saturn aspect sign can be used for good, but it takes *work.* If both people are emotionally immature, then even the Moon trine Saturn synastry aspect will feel difficult and painful. If both partners are emotionally mature, then even the square aspect can feel easy. These aspects depend quite a bit on where both people are in terms of managing their own emotions and needs.

Although these Moon-Saturn aspects are difficult and painful, they also help you deal with your issues in a relationship. If you have one of these aspects, then you can be sure that you will be pushed to learn and grow.

There are typically issues of dependency and security with these aspects. One or both people may feel a heavy sense of responsibility, or they may even act out parent-child roles.

Keep in mind that *all* of these Moon-Saturn aspect descriptions depend *greatly* on the signs of the planets. For example, a Capricorn moon sign will be able to deal with these aspects more easily because they aren’t too emotional. Their emotions won’t trigger Saturn as much.

However, a Cancer moon sign is someone who needs a lot of emotional support, so the lack of nurture from the Saturn partner will create more problems.

With any Moon-Saturn aspects, the Saturn person has the tendency to be cold or rigid. They may shut the Moon person down or withdraw when their emotional reactions feel too extreme. However, they can also bring structure to the Moon person and learn to stick up for themselves instead of retreating.

The Moon person has the tendency to be over-emotional, illogical, or even manipulative. They probably try to force the Saturn person to adhere to what *they* need emotionally instead of looking at the relationship as a partnership. Ideally, they will learn emotional balance, self-sufficiency, and how to better explain and obtain what they need emotionally. They can also learn how to balance their own emotional needs with those of their partner.

## Moon Conjunct Saturn Synastry

The Moon conjunct Saturn synastry aspect indicates a serious, heavy bond. This relationship has a strong air of responsibility. These partners may also feel bound to each other in some way.

At times, the Moon person can feel limited with the Moon conjunct Saturn synastry aspect. They might intuitively know that they can’t express the full range of their moon sign, or that they must hide their emotions in some way.

This is because the Saturn person limits without even realizing it. The Moon person might feel constrained in some way, especially in the sign/house that this Moon conjunct Saturn synastry aspect sits in.

Sometimes, the Moon person also feels the need to censor their feelings of dependency. They feel  that the Saturn person doesn’t want them to appear *too* dependent or needy.

However, the Moon person greatly desires emotional intimacy with this Moon conjunct Saturn synastry aspect. They feel blocked from truly sharing their emotions in some way, whether this is because of external karmic reasons or because they know the Saturn person doesn’t wish for emotional closeness. The Moon person is probably scared of being “too much,” though they can’t help revealing their emotional nature at times.

Any relationship with this Moon conjunct Saturn synastry aspect can be serious and long-lasting. Sometimes, this aspect is the glue that holds a relationship together. The bond can be a bit painful, but it’s also strong and keeps both people coming back to each other.

Ultimately, this relationship *can* work for the better. The Saturn person can learn to be careful with the emotions of the Moon person. The Saturn individual can also help to give the Moon person direction in life.

The Moon person can learn healthy dependency and how to be with another person *without* becoming codependent. This is a painful journey for both people, but this Moon conjunct Saturn synastry aspect can create a great life-long learning opportunity.

This placement is all about balance. If you have this Moon conjunct Saturn synastry aspect and are the Moon individual, be careful not to censor your emotions too much. It’s essential that you share your *true* feelings without going overboard, or you will start to feel trapped.

## Moon Trine Saturn Synastry

With this Moon trine Saturn synastry aspect, the Saturn person is probably a grounding force in the relationship. They can help direct the Moon person to stay on their path and to work for their goals. In the best case scenario, Saturn is a gentle guiding force.

The Moon person probably feels that the Saturn individual is a stable and secure fixture in their lives. This Moon trine Saturn synastry aspect is all about emotional stability. 

This Moon trine Saturn synastry aspect means that both partners may invest in each other emotionally. They take each other quite seriously, so there’s a lot of promise for a long-term relationship with this aspect.

In some sense, both partners are there for each other. The Saturn person is a constant for the Moon person; they can always rely on them. Sometimes, the Saturn person gives more to the Moon person than they receive back, but they probably don’t mind very much.

This Moon trine Saturn synastry aspect creates the glue of the relationship. It makes these partners *want* to stay together and work through their issues. The relationship could get boring or stale over time because it can become very routine.

## Moon Sextile Saturn Synastry

With the Moon sextile Saturn synastry aspect, there is an opportunity for both people to develop healthy emotional maturity in the relationship. However, this doesn’t come totally naturally, and this couple may need to work for a fulfilling end result.

The Moon individual can help the Saturn person work through their karma. The specifics of this karma will depend on the sign and house of this person’s Saturn sign.

On the other hand, the Saturn person can help the Moon to mature emotionally. They bring the structure and stability that the Moon person desperately needs.

With this Moon sextile Saturn synastry aspect, the Moon person can appear emotionally immature compared to the Saturn person. However, this relationship is a lovely opportunity to teach each other things that both people need to mature and grow.

This Moon sextile Saturn aspect can also mean that there is an opportunity for both people to work through issues with their respective parents. Sometimes, the couple is actually acting out parental roles when they first meet. The relationship will bring up issues of dependency or security, but this couple can work through those problems if they work to tackle them.

Ideally, the Saturn person will bring structure to the Moon individual. They will stick up for themselves and find time to work on their own feelings instead of taking on the Moon person’s emotions, which gives the Moon person the opportunity to mature emotionally.

## Moon Opposition Saturn Synastry

This Moon opposition Saturn synastry aspect means that these individuals have opposite reactions to circumstances. The Saturn person might appear overly rigid while the Moon person seems too emotional. When things happen in life, each person simply cannot understand why the other reacts in the opposite way.

In the relationship, the Saturn person can be domineering while the Moon individual is overly emotional or even childish. The Moon person might try to find happiness in the Saturn person instead of within themselves.

Sometimes with this Moon opposition Saturn synastry aspect, there is fear surrounding the stability of the relationship. One or both of these people might feel insecure or have a deep inner fear that the other will betray them.

Typically, the Moon person is afraid of being vulnerable or emotionally injured. The Saturn person fears losing control or getting stuck in an unstable relationship.

Both people with this Moon opposition Saturn synastry aspect may need a lot of reassurance in different ways. This relationship can quickly become emotionally draining, but this is because neither person is getting to the root of the problem and working on their *own* issues. Instead, they try to change the other.

The goal in this Moon opposition Saturn synastry relationship is for the Saturn person to learn how to work with others’ emotions instead of shutting them down. The Moon individual needs to find happiness within instead of clinging to the Saturn person in order to escape their own unhappiness.

## Moon Square Saturn Synastry

With this Moon square Saturn synastry aspect, the Moon person usually feels limited by the Saturn person. The Moon person responds to situations in an emotional manner and may feel judged by the Saturn person when they have these knee-jerk reactions.

The Saturn person might see the Moon person as oversensitive or too defensive. They may feel that there’s little room to share their own feelings because the Moon person’s emotions are seen as more important. Ultimately, neither person feels totally comfortable opening up to each other.

This Moon square Saturn synastry aspect can be extreme with either person. For example, the Saturn individual could be extremely cold and controlling, or the Moon person could be incredibly oversensitive, manipulative, and illogical.

Sometimes, both people are at the extremes, although often one individual is more extreme than the other, depending on the placement, sign, and house of the Moon square Saturn synastry aspect. 

With this Moon square Saturn synastry aspect, the Saturn person must learn to work with the emotional nature of the Moon person. Although the Moon person isn’t always rational, they usually have a good reason for what they feel underneath. The Saturn person needs to dig to figure out the Moon person’s true motives.

On the other hand, the Moon person must learn that the Saturn person does need structure in place over time so that they know what to expect. It’s painful for them to be at the whims of the Moon individual’s emotions.

This Moon square Saturn synastry aspect has a *lot* to do with understanding. If it feels like both people are always on opposite pages then therapy can be helpful. Both parties have very different types of emotional expression, but they must work to understand how they each feel and express their feelings before there will be true contentment in the relationship.

Illusions can be stripped away with hard work. With the Moon square Saturn synastry aspect, both people don’t understand what lies at the core of the other. They must dig to learn the other person on a new level. It is uncomfortable work, but this aspect can push both towards intense emotional growth, if they’re willing to put the work in.
