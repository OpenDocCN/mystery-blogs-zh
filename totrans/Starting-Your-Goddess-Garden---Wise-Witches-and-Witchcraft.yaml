- en: If your mind is spinning with magical gardening ideas and your hands are itching
    to get dirty, then you’re in the right place. The process of creating goddess-themed
    gardens is whimsical and inspiring, not to mention educational. The question for
    most Wiccans is where to begin? At the beginning, of course.

    setting. This alone might give you a great sense for your garden’s layout or embellishments.
    Let’s consider a Greek Goddess just for fun. You could use an oval design (the
    shape of the Coliseum) with some decorative pillars, some of which could have
    hanging plants, adding to the ambiance. These little touches make your Goddess
    feel right at home.

    Artemis garden grow daisies. For Bast, you better bring the catnip! Cerridwen
    likes vervain. Primroses please Freya, add coriander for Hathor, Iris for Isis,
    and some Carnations for Venus. About the only limitations you have in sacred plant
    selections are your regional weather and the size of your garden.

- en: In magick, patterns are power For some Goddess gardens the pattern comes from
    a specified function, like having a clock garden for Horae, the goddess of time.
    (take the clock garden, for example). Other gardens may use geomantic patterns,
    like creating a square garden for the Earth Element with the symbolism of the
    four cardinal directions, four corners of creation and the four winds in mind.
    Alternatively, a circle is certainly apt because we live on a globe. Goddesses
    who would enjoy this garden include Gaia, Rhea, Danu and the Mother Goddess.

- en: As with the plants for your magical garden, choose stones that honor your Goddess
    or augment the energy of your pants. The sacred stones can be put into the soil,
    hung above a window sill (for window gardens), or placed on top of a firm dirt
    surface where it sustains magickal energy. Examples include using topaz for Amaterasu,
    black tourmaline for Aradia, green quartz for Brigit, jet for Hecate, coral for
    Oshun and moonstone for Seline.

    of magickal goals. The more intense the color is, the more potent it is. For example,
    adding a deep red rose to a love garden symbolically deepens the love being grown
    there. Consequently, when a goddess does not have specific sacred plants, or when
    you don’t like the plants suggested, use colors matching your theme and goals.
    You might incorporate pink plants or accent pieces for Aphrodite, red and white
    for Brigit, green for Demeter and Isis, green and white for Kuan Yin, and fire-red
    for Vesta.

    or a bird feeder is more to your liking. And don’t forget some type of Goddess
    figurine. Warning: decorative touches can become addictive and hazardous to one’s

    in your yard both matter if you want to increase the good vibes in your garden.
    Feng Shui tells us that the North facing garden sustains plants that like moisture
    while the South facing garden supports greenery that loves sunlight and warm weather.
    Put metal wind chimes in the Western-oriented garden for good luck, and place
    small ornamental trees in the Eastern garden for the best flow of chi (life energy).

    location of your garden. Air resides in the East representing communication and
    intelligence, which would suit the Greek Goddess Iris nicely. Fire, residing in
    the South, corresponds with the Hawaiian Volcano Goddess Pele. Water is in the
    West, which would make the Nile Goddess Anuket quite pleased. Lastly, we have
    Earth in the Northern, a location ideal for the Incan Goddess Pachamama.

    There are so many spiritual ways of using the plants you’ve grown, let alone mundane
    ones! Why not make a blessing potion for everyone in your house? Design protective
