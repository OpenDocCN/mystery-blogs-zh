    center of the altar. Put one candle on the left side of this bowl, and another
    candle on the right side. Light both candles while reciting the following prayer:'

    Lady of the Staying Power. I hail you. Grant me Your courage, which is that of
    an open yet invincible heart. Grant me Your humility, which is that of mindful
    devotion to Your love. Grant me above all that I may be of service to You, Your
    husband, Your children, and to all Gods who might have use of me. Hail, Sigyn".'

- en: Take a portion of food and drink (ideally a portion of a meal you had intended
    on eating) and offer it to Sigyn on the altar, while saying "For Your time in
    the cave, when You starved and went malnourished in duty to love. May it nourish
    You". Take the bowl in both  hands and lift it above your head, "May I hold this
    bowl in Your stead, Lady. May I take Your place in the cave tonight, for a few
    brief moments". Hold the bowl above your head for a determined amount of time
    (as long as you feel right) to symbolize what Sigyn did for Loki.

    to burn out as an offering. Leave the food on the altar until the following morning.
