- en: My humblest apologies, I did not know you spoke on behalf of everyone on this
    public forum. If I choose to call out fake spells made by children who refuse
    to accept the realities of Magic that is my choice, and since I am not breaking
    any rules educating people on what Magic can and cannot do, I will continue to
    do so. If that offends you, perhaps in future you can try and ignore when I point
    out a spell does not work, honey :)

- en: Clearly you do since you are responding to this dead post. I would like to unpack
    the first half of your comment, are you 22 and in college? Does that make your
    comment more or less valid? Are you assuming I am 22 and in college? Where is
    the evidence of that? Granted, since most individuals on this side ignore evidence
    disproving their biases I am not surprised. However, I am not 22 in college, I
    am in my late twenties and have graduated. Not that it matters since anyone at
    any age can be wise and educated, just as anyone can be immature and ignorant.

- en: I feel he explained himself pretty well [he's also explained himself in other
    posts] he's not breaking any rules, and chooses to educate people by pointing
    out fake spells on the site. As for your comment of ''fun and exciting'' magick
    isn't a game. For many people magick and spells are part of their religious practice.
    Magick isn't like what's depicted in the movies, and for some witches having ignorant
    people who refuse to listen to reality is insulting to their faith

    millionth time, is not breaking any rules. Please, allow him to post things without
    being bashed by delusional children who do not want to accept reality.

    rarer still they actually understand what I am doing and not conclude I am a ''hater''
    you are a breath of fresh air and I commend you. As for Prittypink, Magic is an
    energetic force of nature that brings nature change to our world. What you saw
    in Harry Potter was ''fun and exciting'' because it was fictional entertainment.
    The Magic I practice and this site is founded on, is the real Magic actual witches
    and pagans work with daily. I was raised Wiccan, I do not enjoy watching children
    make a mockery of my faith. Some may be able to laugh it off as ''harmless fun''
    however, one bad apple spoils the bunch, and letting people constantly give false
    claims is harmful to those who do not know any better, get discouraged, and leave
    this path because they honestly did not know any better. I do not fault new members
    who wish to learn, however, those who spread misinformation should be. I merely
    state a fact, Magic does not contradict the laws of nature on the physical plane,
    as a way to inform, and hopefully cause new members to seek further information.
    I am not slapping the tools out of their hands and shaming them, I am saying ''dig
    a little deeper first''. Should they choose to proceed, it is on them.

    was a disagreement. Someone asked me a question, I answered said question. A new
    user chimed in with their opinion and frustration and then two other members explained
    my point. I then gave my explanation. The entire discourse was rather civil. However,
    I would like to point out this occurred a little over 2 years ago and 1 of the
    users has since deleted their account. There was no point in asking us not to
    fight when the situation had well and truly ended. Blessed Be.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It demonstrates the person who wrote this piece of fiction doesn't understand
    the principles being listed. In some traditions, the ''power of three'' is taught
    as basically three people gathering or at least working towards a joint cause,
    saying something three times instead of once, three items to represent a given
    principle rather than one item to represent the same, has more effect than triple
    just one -- to simplify it. But don't waste your time on this spell. It's pure
    fantasy, and cannot work.
