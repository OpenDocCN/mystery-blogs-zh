- en: As a beginner Tarot reader, it can be hard to know where to start. The deck
    feels overwhelming and there are a million different spreads you can use. How
    are you supposed to know where to begin?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I struggled to learn Tarot for many years. It felt like such an uphill battle
    to memorize the cards, and then I struggled to give intuitive readings, to use
    large spreads, etc. Along the way, I learned some valuable tips and saw the areas
    where I wasted a lot of time as a beginner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I did almost every single one of these 10 things that I recommend *not* doing,
    so I’m here to share them with you today. Avoiding these super common mistakes
    will make the process of learning Tarot *so* much easier!

- en: 1\. Reading With the Whole Deck at Once
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you first start out, there’s just no way that you can know the meaning
    of every card in the deck. No matter how much you study them, the definitions
    will fly right out of your head when you’re actually looking at a spread right
    in front of you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, I recommend starting with the Major Arcana. Once you’ve done plenty
    of readings with just these cards (and almost any reading will be accurate even
    using only these cards!) switch to the Minor Arcana. Once you’ve mastered those,
    switch to the Court Cards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if this takes you many months (it took me about 3 months to learn the Major
    Arcana alone, but only a few weeks to learn the Court Cards – it depends on how
    well you practice and how easily the information sticks), it’s worth it because
    you will *actually learn them*. You definitely don’t want to be stuck looking
    up every definition in a year, and this is the best way to deepen your study and
    to go from beginner to intermediate to advanced.

- en: 2\. Not Reading Reversals
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right off the bat, I recommend reading reversals. They are so, so, so important
    both literally and metaphorically!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It does complicate things a bit, but I think it’s *much* more complicated to
    start off not reading them and add reversals in later. I recommend starting with
    only one section of the deck (typically the Major Arcana) and reading the cards
    both upright and reversed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are plenty of online websites where you can find the definitions for both
    versions of the card. The reversed cards offer some perspectives that just aren’t
    available when you only read the cards upright, so I would 100% start that sooner
    rather than later.

- en: 3\. Asking Yes/No Questions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you technically can use your Tarot deck to ask yes/no questions, it isn’t
    really worth your time. First of all, you probably won’t get a very good reading.
    You’ll get hung up on the actual answer (is it yes or no?) and will focus less
    on what the cards are actually telling you to do and why. The Tarot deck is very
    good at giving advice for soul growth, but this can’t always be summed up in a
    yes/no answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, while experienced Tarot readers can usually tell what the outcome
    will be, it’s very difficult for beginners to clearly determine if the deck is
    saying yes or no, especially if they’re emotionally attached to the outcome. For
    these types of questions, you’re much better off using a pendulum ([head to our
    Pendulum Dowsing 101 post for more info](https://teaandrosemary.com/pendulum-dowsing-101/)).
  prefs: []

- en: 4\. Asking Time Sensitive Questions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to yes/no questions, time sensitive questions are really hard for beginners
    to read accurately. These types of questions are best left to the experienced
    Tarot reader. Keep time sensitive questions in the back of your head as you get
    more experienced, but focus on the general meanings of the cards for now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this is something you want to learn, then I recommend getting some in-depth
    books on it. It’s much more complicated than you’re lead to believe by beginner
    Tarot blogs, and it’s really easy to misinterpret the timing of a spread. This
    can cause a lot of damage, so you want to be very careful if you do decide to
    pursue learning about timing readings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you see something in a spread that feels like it may be time-related, then
    by all means read it that way, but I recommend not *asking* time-related questions
    outright as a beginner.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is something that *many* Tarot readers do, whether they’re beginners or
    not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each Tarot card corresponds to at least once element. If you study astrology
    or witchcraft, then you know that elements are extremely important in spiritual
    work, and Tarot readings are no exception.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look up a brief list of what element corresponds to what card and why, and try
    to incorporate the flavor, meaning, and intent of the element into *every single
    reading.* I promise, it will make the readings *so* much better!

- en: 6\. Using Too Large Of a Spread
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For some reason, I see a lot of beginners try to use the Celtic Cross spread.
    Don’t get me wrong: this is a great spread to have up your sleeve at some point,
    but it’s also insanely difficult to use when you’re just learning the cards. When
    reading the Celtic Cross spread, you have to know the cards inside and out *and*
    be able to quickly intuit how they fit together.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beginners and even intermediate Tarot students are far better off using a three
    card spread ([we’ve complied over 50 of our favorites here!](https://teaandrosemary.com/3-card-tarot-spreads-for-every-question-you-could-ever-ask/))
    because they’re complex enough to get a great reading but are simple to do if
    you’re still learning the cards or are even still learning how to intuit the cards
    together in a spread.

- en: 7\. Using Only Memorization
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning Tarot means doing quite a bit of memorization. Every student comes
    to realize this, but there’s a point when you need to combine your memorization
    of the cards with intuition. Without your intuition, a reading will only have
    half the power it could.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you get even a section of the deck memorized, practice reading with your
    intuition during your sessions. For example, after laying down a three card spread,
    look at what the cards actually mean, then use your intuition to broaden those
    meanings and see how they fit together. Look to the metaphors and pay close attention
    to any words, phrases, or images that pop into your head out of nowhere.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning to read with intuition takes a lifetime of practice, but it’s something
    that I recommend starting almost right away. You can even begin at the very beginning
    by looking up the meaning of a card online then trying to read it intuitively,
    and reversing the order of these steps for the next card.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 8\. Using Only Intuition
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the flip side, you do need to learn the meanings of the cards. Some beginner
    Tarot readers try to interpret every reading because they don’t want to do the
    research. Just like you’re missing out when you ignore your intuition, you’ll
    lose a huge part of the reading without actually looking up the significance of
    the cards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Believe me, I know how hard it is to memorize every single card! I actually
    don’t recommend learning them in flashcard form; learning while doing is better.

- en: 9\. Drawing Many Extra Cards as Clarifiers
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you can’t understand a reading, it’s probably because you haven’t figured
    it out yet. Don’t fall into the trap of drawing multiple cards as clarifiers.
    If you do need one clarifier, that’s fine, but if it doesn’t help you figure it
    out, then you need to sit down and do some serious research on the cards you already
    have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Drawing too many clarifiers quickly muddies the water and creates a lot of frustration.
    It’s an easy trap that we all fall into, but I recommend buckling down and working
    with the cards you already have until you get it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, don’t do multiple readings on the same topic. Your first reading
    is the one that will be accurate!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say you lay down a spread and look up all of the definitions. You double
    check, and even try to use your intuition a bit, but you just can’t seem to make
    the cards fit. Is the reading wrong?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most Tarot readers will tell you that the cards never lie, and they’re correct.
    There is one exception. If you knew that you shouldn’t ask a question and asked
    it anyways, then you may not get the answer you’re looking for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you might ask if your partner is cheating on you, and get a reading
    all about self-love. You could easily think that the cards are wrong, or that
    you did it wrong, or that your spirit guides aren’t listening, but all of those
    assumptions are incorrect. The cards *never* lie, but they don’t always give you
    the answer you want. In this case, your sprit guides would be giving you the answer
    they believe you *need.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is always an explanation for why you got certain cards; it’s up to you
    to find it. When you’re confused, look first to the elements. How do the elements
    of the cards fit into the spread and help to answer the question?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look also to what pops into your head. A card might not theoretically fit, but
    the picture or word on the card might have some significant association to you
    that other readers wouldn’t understand. Your spirit guides know this, and they’re
    using this card in a different way *because *you’re the one doing the reading.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When in doubt, write down what you got and keep working on it. Sometimes it
    helps to go back later, but I always find that with enough effort, I’m able to
    see exactly why I got specific cards and just how important they are.

    Just remember that it’s always okay to make mistakes because this is how we learn.
