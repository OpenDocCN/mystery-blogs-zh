This works... right?

No. You can write a letter to the person and burn it to release lingering pain and get some type of closure but you can't delete parts of memories from your or other people's minds because there painful.

Jest because they are painful doesn't mean you need to delete them from your mind or other people's minds even the smallest cut or fragment of memory is still a part of you no matter what you try to do to erase them they're still who they are still a part of you they will end up popping up sooner or later no matter how strong of a spell you do.

It is useful however when you need to quickly pack up and leave without anyone following you or even knowing you exist

I just joined this but I believe that it can work with enough belief an magical power that you push from with in.

hey it works right ?

no, you cannot erase yourself from someones memory. you could try an illusion spell to make them notice you less, and if you are planning on leaving it may work better than others, but the memories will still be there. if you are wanting to forget someone, or start over, this spell won't delete past memories, but you can look into shadow work to work through and release whatever memories you wish to hide form.

Do you burn the paper after you write on it?

Are there any spells here that can give a person the illusion that they don't know about something or actually be able to take those memories?

This might act as a type of cord cutting, but you will not erase your memory from a persons mind. You can break the spiritual bond and their memory of you becomes less intrusive, but it will still be there in a hidden corner.
