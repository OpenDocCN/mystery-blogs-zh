- en: Sacred stones, crystals and metals have fascinated humans for aeons. Their beauty
    hypnotizes; their diversity electrifies. As we became more curious about our world,
    gems were certainly on the list of things people wanted to know more about. Mages,
    mystics and Medicine Men all sought out the spirit of a stone and its capabilities.
    Modern correspondence lists are filled with information on what they discovered.
    The fun part is putting all those energetic attributes to work in our magic.

- en: Witches, Wiccans, Druids, Seers and many other awakened humans use sacred stones
    regularly for a variety of purposes including money magic (prosperity, abundance).
    One might be charged with keen-mindedness so you do better on your job before
    asking for a raise. Another could be saturated with calming energy so you can
    really focus on successful approaches for improving cash flow. In these examples,
    there is no one particular stone that is a MUST. Like any other component in magic,
    what a crystal means to you matters in how you apply it.

    two other pieces of information notable for your [**Book of Shadows**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/book-of-shadows/witchs-book-shadow/)
    for using your new tool. One would be the many ways you can add them to magical
    practices. The second is which stones have natural energy dynamics for prosperity,
    wealth and abundance.
