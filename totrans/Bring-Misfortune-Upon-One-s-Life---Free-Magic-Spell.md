 Put the chickens blood in the bowl. Write the name of the victim on picture. Put the picture in the bowl. Place the black candle in the bowl to hold down the picture.

Blow out the candle. Go outback and dig a hole. Pour the chickens blood and picture in the hole. Bury it.

Tip: If you can, try to get something they touched, like a piece of paper, or something like that or a strand of hair. You could use in the spell, but really that's up to you.

''Have some fun with an enemy's life'' I would hope people wouldn't toy with someone's life for fun. Yes, I completely get wanting to make someone you dislike to suffer [been there, done that, bought the t-shirt] but unless they're actively attacking you, take the high road and live your best life [Nothing upsets your enemies more than seeing you succeed] If you choose to cast this spell, it seems plausible, but I would change a few things, such as adding the blood last [personally I wouldn't pick a different spell because I don't work with blood] be sure to charge your hatred for this person, otherwise, this won't work, or it won't be as strong. [you need to charge negative emotions for curses]
