    Glamour spells have been used by witches for centuries, but they aren’t the most
    well-known types of spells by any means.
  prefs: []

    Google or Pinterest that are readily available. I’m hoping that this post will
    provide you with some simple glamour spell ideas that *work.*

- en: In magic, a *glamour* is a veil that hides what’s underneath. A glamour spell
    brings out one’s natural beauty while hiding those less-than-desirable aspects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re casting a glamour spell, you can either personally choose the aspects
    that you want to enhance or you can simply visualize beauty and let the spell
    choose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A glamour spell typically doesn’t last that long. I find that most glamour spells
    I cast will last for a full day or so. I tend to cast glamour spells when I really
    need them which is mainly for special events.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I personally use glamour spells to appear more like who I truly feel I am inside.
    I don’t use them to run from myself, but I do have specific aspects of myself
    that I like more than others, and enhancing those aspects gives me confidence.

- en: I recommend casting a glamour spell anytime you want to enhance your natural
    beauty. This might be when you feel a bit down, when you want to attract someone,
    when you’re going into a social situation you feel nervous about, or before a
    big night or event.

    glamour spells are relatively harmless, so go for it!
  prefs: []

- en: I don’t recommend that you cast a glamour spell if you feel at odds with yourself.
    A glamour spell is most effective when you harness your inner power and believe
    in yourself, but you first need to have some level of self-love.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A glamour spell isn’t likely to cause any type of negative karma, but it can
    bring out the effects you most *hate* in yourself if it’s cast with a negative
    or self-deprecating attitude.

    Try to plan with the moon phase or sign, depending on the outcome you want. For
    example, the Libra moon would provide very refined beauty, while the Aries moon
    would enhance bold beauty.

    yourself as you actually appear, then making small adjustments. This spell shouldn’t
    be *too* drastic. Start small so that you can actually see the effects.

    dark circles, then enchant your concealer. For larger eyes, enchant your eyeshadow,
    mascara, or eyeliner.
