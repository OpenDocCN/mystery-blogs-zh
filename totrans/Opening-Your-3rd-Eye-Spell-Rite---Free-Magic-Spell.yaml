    flower tighly closed in the region of your third eye. Start to take slow deep
    breaths. With each breath you take in, draw in the magic power about the room.
    With each breath out, use that power to start slowly opening the flower. you may
    find that it will take a while for the flower to fully bloom. It will probably
    take a few of these spell rites. Do you rush it at all. Infact I highly encourage
    you to hold this spell rite over the span of 5-7 days.

- en: When done with the meditation, you should feel a bit lighter and you may feel
    like you have a headache. Do not panick. This is because you are opening up a
    part of yourself that has been closed tight. This will stop in time. Blow out
    the candles when done but let the incese burn out on its own. Infact if there
    is incese still burning, take it into the bathroom and slip into the relaxing
    bath. It is a great way to get the maxium of maxium of your incense.

- en: I personally have found this spell rite great if repeated once or twce a year.
    It helps clean and clear the 3rd eye. If you see your (flower faded, changing
    color or wilting) it is definatly time to perform this spell.

- en: There are far easier ways to open your third eye chakra. Also, you need to work
    your way up to the third eye chakra. Forcing it open when you are not spiritually
    prepared can have negative results. Furthermore, forcing too much energy into
    any chakra can have negative results. Your third eye might have psychic ability
    associations, but also imagination, creativity and intuition to name a few. You
    could suffer migraines, hallucinations, and struggle to concentrate.
