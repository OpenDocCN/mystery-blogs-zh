    of your eye. Or feel the presence of one around or maybe even a low growl sound.
    Give them and yourself time to learn about each other.

- en: yes, this does work [i feel i need to state that] it's like a house blessing.
    the only thing i take issue with is the ''don't call on a chaos Dragon'' part.
    while i don't work well with chaos Dragons, they're not evil, or really dangerous,
    just intense [that is the nature of chaos] if you have a very logical mind and
    have trouble with disorder, don't work with them unless you're ready. if you are
    use to chaos and don't follow a linear line of thinking you'll have an easier
    time with chaos Dragons. [granted, i wouldn't pick them as my first choice right
    out of the gate, but everyones different]

- en: If you want to make friends with dragons or any spiritual being you work with,
    talk to them. This works as a protection, but not as a dragon friendship spell.
    Make an altar, leave offerings, say prayers of thanks, and otherwise speak to
    them as you would a friend.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saying this is by D.J. Conway makes me question if it's actually real because
    she's a controversial member of the pagan community. [I've read her two books
    on Dragon magick, and only found 1 thing useful in it] But reading over the spell,
    I don't see the reason why you need that specific moon. You also don't need a
    spell to befriend your Guardian Dragon. You befriend your Guardian the same way
    you would a deity; spend time with them. But, I don't see any harm in trying the
    spell and seeing how it goes for you.
