- en: If you want this spell to be successful, you need to do it during the time that
    you are most fertile. Ahead of time, you should gather together one banana, one
    apple, an agate crystal and a knife. Both the banana and the apple are symbols
    of fertility. The agate crystal represents happiness, fertility, and health, among
    other things.

  zh: 如果你希望这个咒语成功，你需要在你最容易受孕的时候进行。提前准备好一个香蕉、一个苹果、一块玛瑙水晶和一把刀。香蕉和苹果都是生育的象征。玛瑙水晶代表幸福、生育和健康，以及其他一些东西。
- en: When you are ready to begin your spell, clean off the apple and the banana.
    Slice the fruit and combine them in a bowl. Grab your agate crystal and head to
    a forest or a park. If you have a garden, that is the best choice. Look for a
    tree; a birch tree is preferable, but you can select anything.

  zh: 当你准备开始咒语时，清洁苹果和香蕉。切碎水果，放入碗中。拿起你的玛瑙水晶，前往森林或公园。如果你有花园，那是最好的选择。寻找一棵树；桦树是首选，但你也可以选择其他树木。
- en: If you can, it is best to put up a circle of protection around the tree. If
    you cannot do that, find a good place to sit and put up a protective circle. Call
    out to the God and Goddess and tell that that you want to carry a child. Talk
    about what you want your family to look like and your desire to be a parent. Speak
    about the love that you have in your heart.

  zh: 如果可能的话，最好在树周围设置一个保护圈。如果不能这样做，找一个好地方坐下，并设置一个保护圈。向神祇呼唤，并告诉他们你想要怀孕一个孩子。谈谈你希望你的家庭是什么样子的，以及你想成为一个父母的愿望。谈论你心中的爱。
- en: Pick up the fruit bowl and recite these words “Goddesses and Gods of fruition
    and fertility, take this offering and bring my sweet child to me. All be well,
    mote it be.”

- en: Pick up the agate crystal and allow yourself to feel happiness and love. Think
    about being pregnant. Visualize giving birth. If you believe it, it can happen.
    Think about what your baby will look like. Will it be a boy or a girl? What will
    it feel like to be a parent? What will your child’s school years look like? What
    activities will you do with your new family? What would change for you? Allow
    the visualization to take over while you clutch your crystal. Give it energy through
    your own energy.

  zh: 拿起玛瑙水晶，让自己感受到幸福和爱。想象怀孕的感觉。想象分娩的过程。如果你相信，就能实现。想象一下你的宝宝会是什么样子。他或她是男孩还是女孩？成为父母会是什么感觉？你的孩子的学校生活会是什么样子？你会和你的新家庭做什么活动？对你会有什么改变？当你抱着水晶的时候，让想象力占据你的思维。通过你自己的能量给予水晶能量。
- en: Stay with the visualization for as long as feels appropriate. When you are finished,
    thank the God and Goddess for being with you and helping you.

  zh: 不要与玛瑙水晶分离。确保它靠近你，并在有需要时握着它。让它提醒你自己的目标是什么。保持快乐和喜悦。
- en: Your child is not a physical presence in your life yet, but he or she will arrive
    when the time is right. That does not mean you cannot talk to your child however.
    Tell your little one how much you want him or her and how you can’t wait for their
    birth day.

  zh: 你的孩子在你生活中还不是一个实体存在，但在合适的时候，他或她会出现。这并不意味着你不能和你的孩子交流。告诉你的小宝贝你有多么想要他或她，以及你迫不及待等待他们的出生。
- en: In addition, it is important to keep in mind that there are several herbs that
    will make you more likely to become pregnant. Stay away from coffee and consume
    nettle tee instead.

  zh: 另外，要记住有一些草药会让你更容易怀孕。远离咖啡，改喝荨麻茶。
- en: Once the process is complete, stay away from stressful situations and try not
    to worry about anything. If you are able to relax, you are much more likely to
    become pregnant. Understand that the pregnancy may not happen immediately. If
    you are able to enjoy your life and not allow your potential pregnancy to consume
    you, you are more likely to have your little one on the way sooner rather than
    later. This is advice is true for anyone that is trying to have a baby. Have fun
    with your partner and enjoy being a family of two for the time being. Recognize
    that the Universe is one with you, and your dreams will become a reality one day.
    Continue to visualize your future baby and hold hope in your heart for the future.

  zh: 一旦过程完成，请远离压力情境，尽量不要担心任何事情。如果你能放松，怀孕的可能性会更大。要明白怀孕可能不会立即发生。如果你能享受生活，并且不让潜在的怀孕消耗你，你更可能尽早迎来小宝宝的到来。这个建议对任何试图怀孕的人都适用。与你的伴侣共度美好时光，享受两人世界。认识到宇宙与你同在，你的梦想总有一天会成真。继续想象未来的宝宝，并在心中怀抱希望。
