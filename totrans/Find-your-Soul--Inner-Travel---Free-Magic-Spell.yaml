    personal acquaintance with your soul, it will not work for everyone because for
    some in a past life have betrayed the soul, so they shy themselves but anyone
    can still travel within themselves.

    flame to clear the mind while others require complete silence...I found music
    and incense help most find a way to calmly exert their energy.

- en: To gain focus by candle, this works best whose element is fire since it will
    create a stronger connection to the person. Stare at the flame, it dosn't matter
    how long for it takes because focus is not so quickly gained, watch the flame
    flicker then it begins. Don't pay attention to anything else but the flame then
    once that is achieved close your eyes. Once closed think of the following of your
    choice, a library with telaportic books, portal, waterfall, painless lava or fire
    anything that you can go through or can transport you automatically without your
    guidance. Mine is a neon waterfall surrounded by crystals while some have books
    that take them or portals. Imagine your teleporter and tell it to take you to
    where you need to go and if your just interested in seeing your soul tell it you
    need to see your soul. Now your journey begins in your experience I can not tell
    you what to expect but always know nothing is impossible once in your spiritual
    self and I suggest putting locks in important places to keep things safe and good
    luck for what you want to know is just hidden in yourself. If your going by element
    on the beginning of the topic, those of water may want a bowl of water to dip
    there hands in frequently until they are ready then close your eyes. I hope you
    are able to succeed since the others I brought there were in my personal life
    so I could find ways to help them focus better but if you need any help message
    me on here or my email. AsariGoddess is my username but when messaging just call
    me by Vayessa. Good luck to all of you.

- en: We are all of the elements, we aren't connected to only one. The writer is probably
    referring to those more drawn to the fire element. At various times in our life
    we can be more drawn to a particular element for whatever reason. If you enjoy
    staring at fire it will relax you more than someone who's nervous around it. If
    you are one of these people I might swap it out with a meditation video/soundtrack
    of running water, a windy day, or nature sounds to connect more with that element.

    skry can bring you into a trance state. I am skeptical of the claims in this spell,
    but try it and see how it goes. Remember, you might connect with one element more
    than another, but we are all the elements, we do not have ''an element'' as this
    spell suggests.
