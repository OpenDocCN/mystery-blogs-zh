## Casting Instructions for 'Get rid of a DemonNegetive Entity, and restore the damage it has done to your chakras. (Very Advanced!!!)'

Make sure the bound item is out of your circle at the beginning of this ritual.

Part one: Banishing.

1.) First light the black, white, and grey candles.
Do NOT light the incense yet.

2.) Walk away from the circle and grab the bound item. (This is for if it's small and flammable.)

3.) Burn it with the white, grey, and black candles.
(If it's the correct item, it will burn quickly or burst into flames.)
Immediately drop it on the plate to be disposed of, cover it and the plate entirely with the black cloth, and light the incense.

Cover the burned item with the black cloth.
(It has to be bigger than the plate.)

Begin lighting the chakra candles, and sit in the center of your five point star when finished.

If you haven't made your own chant, here's a good one.

Chant:
Away, Away, Far Away.
Plague me no more on this day.
Wane, wane, go and wane.
Fly Away, Far away.
Away Away, Stay Away.
And from this day, Away you'll Stay.

Feel the energy building up as your soul is freed from this darkness.

Chant until you feel safe enough to step away from the circle.

Part two: Healing.

Step away from the circle and out of the room\vicinity you're in.

Wait until you are sure the stick incense has burned completely out, and try to feel as if the negative entity in trapped in this circle doesn't exist at all.
(What demon? This ritual was simply to catch up on my chakra health!)
This will destroy it.

After you have done this, Walk back in, extinguish all candles, and dispose of the plate, cloth, and all of it's contents.
Do NOT uncover the plate.
Grab the cloth and plate, being extra careful not to touch the contents.
Do NOT think about what you're holding.
Simply avert your eyes, throw it out in a place away from home, or in an outside trash can.
(If in trashcan near home, you must refrain from even thinking about it until the trash is taken to the dump.)

You may have noticed that you started to feel better during the ritual.
All of the colored candles that burned out represent restored chakras. All of the standing candles you had to extinguish had more extensive damage, and therefore will need extra and separate healings.

Take note of these, and have a cleansed day. :)
...

For if your object is large and nonflammable, or just non flammable:

Tear, cut, or damage the item. If it's a stone or metal item\jewelery piece that's nearly impossible to break, when placing it onto the plate chant:

Down, Down, Away, Away.
This is now your resting place.
A plate of which there's no escape.
A plate and cloth shall be your grave.

Put as much energy into this as possible.

If it's a long necklace, heat up on white, grey, and black candles until hpot or red hot.
The set it on the plate and light the incense.
