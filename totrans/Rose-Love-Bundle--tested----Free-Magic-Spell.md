 ## Casting Instructions for 'Rose Love Bundle *tested*'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Cup

*   Sugar

*   Three napkins

*   Straw (or other stirring material)

*   Rubber bands

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Rose petals

*   Cup

*   Sugar

*   Water

*   Three napkins

*   Straw (or other stirring material)

*   Rubber bands

*   Red ribbon (optional)

 First you take the cup and fill it with water, enough so that all the rose petals can soak. Sprinkle some sugar in the water and then stir it. Then add the rose petals and stir. Let the petals soak for a while while you prepare the first napkin. If it's not already folded in fours, fold it twice. Take the rose petals out and place them on the folded napkin and sprinkle some sugar on the petals again. 
Bring the corners to the center and secure with a rubber band if needed. Then put the first napkin bundle in the second napkin and repeat. Do the same for the last napkin.

When all the napkins are wrapped securely around the rose petals, tie a red ribbon around it if you have one. If you don't, a rope or any type of string will work. Then just carry the bundle around in your purse or pocket.

Well there you have it, I hope this works for you like it did for me. The day after I made the bundle, I carried it around school with me and people were actually talking to me, which is extremely unusual.
Blessed be.
