    fake, but it does have the basic outline to bless a staff.

- en: Runes do not grant power-ups like super strength or speed. They are symbols
    you can use in spells to enhance them. Most people refer to the futhark runes,
    and they have spirits attached to them. A common ritual when working with them
    is blooding the runes as payment for the spirits. Research the specific type of
    runes you wish to work with to understand them better. You can draw a rune of
    protection on a door to cast a spiritual protection. It would not create a shield
    that repels unwanted guests. A rune used to gain speed could work by making training
    easier for you and you reach the goal sooner. But you would not draw a rune on
    your shoes and suddenly are the faster person on the planet despite never taking
    track.

- en: Again, research the deity in question. There are general tips and tricks, but
    knowing the deity in question you wish to work with can help you. Think of it
    like trying to call your friend, but you do not know their number. You could ask
    someone for it, or you could type in 111-1111, 111-1112, 111-1113... until you
    figured it out. The divine is all around us. You can pray to them. out loud or
    in your head, just talk. If this is the first time meeting, introduce yourself,
    be respectful, ask if they would like to work with you. Explain why you wish to
    work with them. Ask for a sign if it is a yes, then thank them for listening.
    You can pick the sign, but do not be too obvious or obtuse. Say, if it is a yes,
    you want to see the number 444, or if their animal is a black dog, you want to
    see three black dogs for a yes.

    do not need to be permanent, big, obvious altars. There is an Altoids tin altar
    trend where people carry a mini altar with them. You could keep everything in
    a shoe box or locked drawer. Even a strategic altar which looks like a decoration
    can work. But, not needed to connect with the divine. You can create astral altars
    and they will work. Basically, while meditating, visualize a sacred space where
    you can have an altar and your deity can join you face to face.

- en: If you do not have a deity in mind, be observant. Practice mindfulness and meditation
    to keep you aware of your surroundings. This works not only to recognize when
    a deity is reaching out, but synchronicities and signs which can answer questions
    you might have. What is your cultural background? Research the deities your ancestors
    might have worked with. What animals do you like? Colour? Time of day? Activities?
    Are you drawn to a certain element, season, or type of weather? Google ''Deity
    associated with'' whatever you feel drawn to. You should feel this connection
    when you see your deity. It might not be dramatic, but something like you keep
    returning to a deity, you feel a pulse, a warmth, or a type of familiarity to
    a deity. That would be a sign you might want to reach out. They might not be your
    forever deity, but this could be a step on your journey.

- en: Lastly, while meditation is important and you can connect while meditating,
    keep a dream journal. Divine beings usually connect with us through dreams. You
    might not hear a deity like someone is standing next to you, but you might get
    a feeling, a random song in your head, or notice patterns in your life. Say you
    are reaching out to The Morrigan, which is associated with crows. Suddenly, you
    notice crows following you or acting strangely. This is usually a sign a deity
    is reaching out. Also, if you know any divination, you can try using divination
    to communicate.
