- en: No. You can write a letter to the person and burn it to release lingering pain
    and get some type of closure but you can't delete parts of memories from your
    or other people's minds because there painful.

- en: Jest because they are painful doesn't mean you need to delete them from your
    mind or other people's minds even the smallest cut or fragment of memory is still
    a part of you no matter what you try to do to erase them they're still who they
    are still a part of you they will end up popping up sooner or later no matter
    how strong of a spell you do.

- en: no, you cannot erase yourself from someones memory. you could try an illusion
    spell to make them notice you less, and if you are planning on leaving it may
    work better than others, but the memories will still be there. if you are wanting
    to forget someone, or start over, this spell won't delete past memories, but you
    can look into shadow work to work through and release whatever memories you wish
    to hide form.

    know about something or actually be able to take those memories?

- en: This might act as a type of cord cutting, but you will not erase your memory
    from a persons mind. You can break the spiritual bond and their memory of you
    becomes less intrusive, but it will still be there in a hidden corner.
