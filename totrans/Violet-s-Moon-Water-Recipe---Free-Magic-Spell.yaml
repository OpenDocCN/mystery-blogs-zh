- en: Moon Water can be an incredibly versatile ingredient. Whether it's cleansing
    your tools, giving your body a refresh, or just a simple enhancement to your magick,
    having the energy of the moon in liquid form proves quite beneficial to an opportunistic
    witch. This tutorial is for straight moon water, the optional ingredients are
    for powering up a specific intention.

    the most simplified terms, full moons are good for letting go and getting a fresh
    slate. The water made from a full moon will serve best in cleansing your home,
    tools, and body. On the other hand, the water made under a new moon will serve
    you well in beginning anew with focused intentions and manifestations. If you
    have a very specific intention you with to instill on the water, consider looking
    into the zodiac of the moon you're performing under to see if it fits.

    up at the moon like a prayer. This works              best if you work with moon
    deities who may call on by name. You may also whisper your affirmations into the
