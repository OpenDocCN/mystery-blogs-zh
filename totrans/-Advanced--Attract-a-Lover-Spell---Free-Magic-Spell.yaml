- en: Before you start, You would want to create an oil Infused with Dragons Blood
    resin, To do so you break a few pieces of dragons blood resin and place it in
    glass jar or bottle and fill the jar with almond oil or grape seed oil. The dragons
    blood to oil ratio is preferably 1 part dragons blood to 8 parts oil. You can
    use more or less but to be warned, more could stain surfaces. You would want to
    let this oil sit in the dark or under full moonlight for at least 2 weeks, it
    is best to charge it with Quartz crystals.

- en: What kind of candle you use is up to you, I would do this spell with a Burgundy
    (Dark Red) Taper candle to utilize the more darker energies this spell takes.
    Make sure the candle wax is colored all the way through and the core isn't white,
    because the vibration of the red color really aid with your magick and intentions.
    The burgundy candle I use is from Michaels (Craft store from the US) Their taper
    candles for the most part are colored all the way through.

- en: Graveyard Dirt is not an herb or root, but actual dirt from a graveyard. It
    is often collected from a person's grave, which each person's grave has different
    properties from the dirt of their grave. (Dirt from a Murderer's grave is best
    for hexes and curses while dirt from a Witch's grave has a more general use) When
    the dirt is collected, An offering is always left, Whether it be alcohol, food,
    flowers, cigars or coins. A good substitute for graveyard dirt is dried patchouli
    leaves or valerian root (smells really bad). I don't collect my own graveyard
    dirt but I purchase it, NEVER buy your graveyard dirt from websites or stores
    besides Etsy. Often graveyard dirt that's sold is just regular dirt that's being
    sold as graveyard dirt. Etsy is a handmade marketplace website that has multiple
    sellers, often times the graveyard dirt sold by them is authentic.

    crushed roots and resin and roll the anointed candle around the roots towards
    you. Now you've dressed your candle. Be warned though- Always stay in the room
    when a candle is lit, especially a dressed one as the herbs, roots and curios
    could catch fire from the flame.

    your dragon's blood resin onto the coal. let the smoke fill the room. As it does,
    meditate on the intention that a lover (whether it be a specific person or a new
    person) will come and there will be no blockages. Do this for as long as you want,
    30 seconds, 5 minutes, one hour. However long.

- en: Now you want to place the candle in a holder on top of a black or silver plate and
    put quartz crystals, dragons blood, graveyard dirt and roots on the plate. Now
    drop some dragons blood oil in a clockwise circle around the parameters of the
    plate. You could use 13 drops of oil in this step since in Hoodoo, 3, 7, 9 and
    13 are often used as they have magickal properties, and contrary to popular belief,
    13 is not an unlucky number, it's a quite lucky number in hoodoo. You can write
    on a paper from a brown paper bag a petition to attract a lover with a red pen
    or dragon's blood ink (Etsy is a good place to get it) You can write their qualities,
    their features, or what kind of person they are. You'll write it down, fold it
    towards you and place it under the candle holder.

    the energy run through the tips of your fingers, You can have binaural beats or
    nature sounds playing to enhance your focus. Enchant the candle, feel the energy
    run through the room. You could open the window to let the natural air compliment
    your magick. Focus, focus, focus, on attracting that Lover. You got this!

- en: You can sit for hours or minutes putting the energies into the candle, when
    you feel it is enough for today, You want to snuff the candle with a candle snuffer,
    Never blow out a candle in magick as it represents that you are blowing the energy
    away from the spell. You would want to repeat this every night until the candle
    runs out or for 7 days. It is best started the week after the new Moon and finished
    when the full moon is about to start.
