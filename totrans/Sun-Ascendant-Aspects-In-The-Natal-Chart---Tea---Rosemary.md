Sun-Ascendant aspects are all about how you appear versus who you truly are. For this reason, I think these aspects are *so* interesting!

These Sun-Ascendant aspects will dictate if you show your true qualities to others or if you wear a mask, hiding who you truly are.

Many of these aspects are qualities that we’re born with. While they can’t be changed or erased, these aspects can be transmuted for your highest good. With any aspect, there is always a lesson.

## Sun Conjunct Ascendant

If you have the Sun conjunct Ascendant aspect, you get *noticed.* You probably make a strong impression on others without even trying. In a group, people notice you quickly or may even watch you, mesmerized by your very being.

You have a magnetic personality in a super “sunny” way. Unless your Sun conjunct Ascendant aspect is in a sign like Scorpio, you don’t come off as dark at *all*. Your disposition and your style are both sunny and happy.

Around others, your entire self is on display. You appear very upfront and honest, but you’re also pretty charismatic. In fact, this Sun conjunct Ascendant placement can make you seem more like a Leo than like the sign that the conjunction is in.

However, there is the potential for you to become too egotistical. Because you know the influence and power that you naturally possess, it can go to your head if you let it. You must learn humility and that this natural power is a gift, not something to use for selfish reasons.

The goal with Sun conjunct Ascendant is to learn how to become more giving and caring towards others. It will be essential to be in *many* different types of relationships in order to learn this.

Sometimes, you may struggle to express the sign that is opposite of your Sun conjunct Ascendant sign. For example, if your Sun conjunct Ascendant is in Cancer, it can feel like Capricorn is an integral part of you that you’re never able to show.

It’s essential that you learn, in this lifetime, to express the opposite sign to those you’re close with and are in intimate relationships with. Your shadow self is even more hidden, so this takes extra work for you to deal with the shadow self.

You have a lot of leadership potential with Sun conjunct Ascendant. You’re honest, upfront, and forceful. However, you must learn to remember that your employees or coworkers are important, too. You possess a good deal of initiative and might be a self-starter in many areas.

Remember that not everyone else has the same skills as you, but everyone *does* possess a unique set of talents that are equally as important. They may have different motives that you. It’s easy for you to only see your primary agenda, but try to broaden your lens when working with others and put yourself in their shoes.

Ultimately, you are self-reliant and self-confident. You wear your heart on your sleeve and want to be recognized for your own work.

One of the best qualities of this Sun conjunct Ascendant placement is that you aren’t afraid to jump in and get things done! You believe wholeheartedly that you’re in control of your destiny and that anything you desire can become a reality.

## Sun Trine Ascendant

With the Sun trine Ascendant aspect, you typically make a great first impression, You are charming and attractive. People are naturally drawn to you.

In fact, you have a talent for attracting people to you, so you’re probably popular and well-liked, at least by general standards. You have a *lot* of energy that puts out rather magnetic vibes.

Sun trine Ascendant means that it’s easy for you to make friends with others. This is a natural talent of sorts; you were born with these skills.

You do have an authority to your presence, but you’re not too strict or too egotistical. You simply have an important energy. Others aren’t confused by your identity; you show who you are and have a clear outer personality.

With this Sun trine Ascendant aspect, you can be a bit restless in life. You may find yourself jumping from one thing to the next. It’s easy for you to woo people, but you must remember to actually stick around and build relationships.

This Sun trine Ascendant aspect is an *easy* trine. However, this means you may also coast through life, taking the admiration that others give you for granted. You may gravitate towards the people who *don’t* give you this attention and try to woo them. Don’t forget that true relationships are built on much deeper foundations than just admiration. 

Job-wise, you typically enjoy performing. This doesn’t only mean on stage (although you might like the spotlight). You can also “perform” with clients, in social grounds, playing sports, etc.

## Sun Sextile Ascendant

With Sun sextile Ascendant, you express yourself quite openly, especially early in life. You’re probably charismatic and outgoing. People are quickly drawn towards you.

You are natural, easy to like, and friendly. You seem very open and approachable; nothing about your personality makes other people nervous.

Sun sextile Ascendant means that you also appear quite positive, especially when others first meet you. There is a sense of authority about you, but you come across as quite sincere instead of egotistical. 

You also appear to be quite truthful. It’s rare for someone to question if you were telling the truth after meeting you. This is because you seem so self-aware and self-expressive.

Generally, Sun sextile Ascendant means that you’re outgoing. Keep in mind that this is flavored by the signs that both planets are in. A Cancer Ascendant individual will be less outgoing than someone with a Leo Ascendant. 

However, Sun sextile Ascendant also means that you quickly grow bored or restless. You may move around a lot or bounce from thing to thing, especially in your younger years.

You have the opportunity to develop important leadership skills with this placement. You can cultivate a powerful, charismatic energy that takes you far in life.

With Sun sextile Ascendant, you also have the opportunity to develop into someone who flourishes in the public eye. However, unlike the trine, this will take a bit of work. Sun sextile Ascendant means that these outgoing, authoritative qualities aren’t totally natural to you, but they will be relatively easy to develop.

Remember to use your skills for good and for the benefit of others as well as yourself.

## Sun Opposition Ascendant

With Sun opposition Ascendant, you struggle to fully express your identity unless you’re in a relationship. You need a companion to feel complete.

This partner may be a friend, business associate, or romantic significant other. This isn’t a solely romantic aspect. In fact, you probably feel more complete being around an enemy than you do by yourself. 

You may not stay single for very long. If you are single, then you’ll need someone else by your side, such as a partner or best friend. This is also a common aspect for twins. You simply can’t truly express your identity unless you have someone else to help you do so.

There may be a conflict with how you express yourself if you have the Sun opposition Ascendant aspect. You feel as though everyone gets the wrong impression of you. For example, you may come off as soft (when you feel tough or cold inside) or vice-versa. Look at the signs that the Sun opposition Ascendant aspect sits in to determine how this happens.

You may have insecurities about the qualities of your rising sign, or may dislike that other people see you as this sign. It’s very common for people with Sun opposition Ascendant to feel disconnected from their rising sign, as though it isn’t really them, or is a false perception of who they are.

With Sun opposition Ascendant, you achieve confidence through intimate relationships. You need to get close enough to someone to reveal this hidden side of you.

Sometimes, you may attract partners who are more like your Sun sign than you are, at least outwardly.

Alternatively, this Sun conjunct Ascendant aspect can mean that you seek out approval from other people in order to feel confident. It’s as though your core sense of self is hidden, so you look to other people to define it for you. Shadow work and therapy focusing on boundaries can be helpful with this issue.

Be careful with this Sun conjunct Ascendant aspect that you don’t rely on others to define yourself. Instead, work to develop an inner sense of self by accessing the shadow side.

## Sun Square Ascendant

With the Sun square Ascendant aspect, you have low self-esteem around others. You may feel like you always present a “bad” or disjointed picture. This placement can cause a good deal of social anxiety.

You may feel that your true personality doesn’t line up with how others see you. It’s as though you wear a mask in public. When people get to know you intimately, they might confirm that you appear completely different upon first meeting than you truly are.

However, because you have a need for approval from others, you keep that mask up most of the time. Even though it probably doesn’t work well or make you feel good, the mask is all you know. Look to the sign that the Ascendant is in to see the qualities of this mask. You show the qualities of you Ascendant sign in public, but don’t feel that it’s truly who you are.

Early in life, you sacrificed what you wanted, such as your goals or ambitions. This was necessary to keep a relationship going or to keep those around you happy, but you built up resentment over time.

Teachers or other authority figures didn’t like or notice you with Sun conjunct Ascendant. You developed your Ascendant’s mask to try and make yourself more pleasing in some way, but it never truly worked.

You felt easily misunderstood. You were insecure about how you appeared to others, or you may have felt as though you were always an imposter.

In fact, Sun square Ascendant is *all* about imposter syndrome. It’s like you’re pretending to be someone else, someone who doesn’t have the same goals or values that you do. As you work to develop self-confidence, these two pieces will grow closer to each other.

You will come to realize with Sun square Ascendant that you must be your true self instead of following how others *expect* you to live. One of the benefits of this Sun square Ascendant placement is that it forces you to rely only on yourself.

Ultimately, you won’t gain self confidence with Sun square Ascendant until you break through and go after your goals. It isn’t an easy path, but following your inner ambition is the only way to get self-respect and feel truly confident in public. 

You probably won’t meet friends or partners who are truly right for you. There’s a lot of potential for shallow relationships with Sun square Ascendant. Others don’t appreciate you or put you down, but this will continue to happen until you let go of the past and focus on what’s good for *you*. It is only then that you will attract individuals who will lift you up.

With Sun square Ascendant, you are afraid that you will never grow into your full potential. The road ahead can feel really confusing. You can’t find a path to help people see who you really are.

The way through the difficulties of the Sun square Ascendant placement is to focus on *your* goals and beliefs rather than what others think of you. Action is really important here. You simply must *do* what feels right to you and your self-confidence will grow over time.

Keep in mind that you probably won’t ever be as charismatic as someone with Sun trine Ascendant might be. You *do* tend to get off on the wrong foot with others; they might even question your sincerity because they can feel that you’re not being your authentic self.

However, the goal with this placement isn’t to make others like you, but to have so many goals that feel *right* for you that you simply stop caring. Once you achieve this, you will appear much more authentic in public. Your mask will start to blend with your Sun Sign and others will see you as a mix of the two.
