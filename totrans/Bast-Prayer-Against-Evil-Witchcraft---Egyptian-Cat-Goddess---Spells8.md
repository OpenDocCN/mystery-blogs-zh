> 来源：[https://spells8.com/bast-devotional/#0001-01-01](https://spells8.com/bast-devotional/#0001-01-01)

Bast, also known as Bastet, is an ancient Egyptian goddess with a complex and fascinating mythology. She is often depicted as a woman with the head of a domesticated cat, and was originally worshiped as a goddess of fertility and childbirth. Over time, her role expanded to include protection, music, dance, and joy.

She symbolizes the joy of living as it is considered the deity of harmony and happiness. She was typically represented in the form of a domestic cat, or as a woman with the head of a cat, always carrying a sistrum (musical instrument) because she was especially pleased by humans dancing and playing music in her honor.

The cult of Bast was so important that cats were raised in her temples to be her representation, and at the death of these, they were carefully mummified and buried in specific tombs for them.

In her warrior aspect, she was a lioness with green skin and in this aspect she was associated with sunlight. She was a solar goddess until the identification of the Greeks with her lunar goddess [Artemis](https://spells8.com/artemis-devotional/).

Mother of the gods, the One, the Only,

Mistress of the Crowns, you rule all.

Sekhmet is your name when you are wrathful,

Bast, beloved, when your people call.

Daughter of the Sun, with flame and fury

Flashing from the prow upon the foe.

Safely sails the Boat with your protection

Passing scatheless where your fires glow.

Daughter of the Sun, the burial chamber

Lies in the darkness till your light appears.

From your Throne of Silence send us comfort,

Bast, beloved, banish all our fears.

Mother of the Gods, no Gods existed

Till you came there and gave them life.

Sekhmet of the Boat, the wicked fear you

Trampling down all evil and all strife.

Mother of the Gods, the great, the loved one,

Winged and mighty, unto you we call,

Naming you the Comforter, the Ruler,

Bast, beloved, Mother of us all.

Bast, descend upon me. Fill me with you.

Expel all evil forces from me.

Destroy and banish all witchcraft, bonds and curses.

Drive out all obsession, envy, jealousy. Physical, mental, moral, spiritual illness.

Use your strength to command all evil spirits,

all presences that bother me, to abandon me immediately.

Let them withdraw me forever and burn in eternal hell.

I remain protected, armored, anointed, sealed and cleaned.

Inside and out, in your name, Bast.

With your presence and your powerful armor,

I consecrate and surrender my night, with my sleep and my rest.

My day and all my activities.

Take away everything that could harm me.

Any envies, accusations, revenge, anger, betrayals,

hatred, phobias, fears, doubts, confusion, lies, deceptions,

bitterness, and depressions.

Help me so that nobody can cause me damage,

and forgive me for any harm that I have caused so far.

May your power defend me and set me free.

Bast, beloved, banish all my fears.

You are the divine Flame,

you are the great Flame at the prow of the Boat of your father.

Praise to you who are mightier than the Gods.
