- en: The Midheaven (MC) and the Imum coeli (IC) are two opposite points in astrology
    that are calculated based on your place and time of birth. The IC shows the qualities
    that you learned in childhood and the environment that you wanted to escape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sign of the IC will show us where our roots are, where we gain our sense
    of belonging, and the qualities that we have to change or leave behind as we grow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can probably tell, most of us have a love-hate relationship with our
    IC points. We feel most comfortable here, yet we also want to push away from the
    IC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to get away from the values of the IC, you push towards the Midheaven.
    In fact, the Midheaven is how people tend to perceive you in the outer world,
    but more specifically in your career. Although you may embrace the qualities of
    your Midheaven, the IC always exists underneath.
  prefs: []

- en: The Midheaven is an astrological point that is located exactly opposite to the
    IC. It is found at the top of the chart and it corresponds to career, status in
    society, and public image.

- en: Usually, the Midheaven can be synonymous with the 10th house. It also represents
    how one’s perspective of life changes as they age and grow from childhood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the Midheaven has more of a personal touch, too. It can be seen as
    a person’s ego and it is very important because it represents where a person gains
    his or her greatest sense of belonging in the world. Your Midheaven point will
    show you how you try to fit in and to feel OK, even if you were made to feel bad
    in childhood.
  prefs: []

    child, and learning how to shine and fit into the world as an adult.

- en: With your IC in Aquarius, you probably felt very different as a child. You never
    quite fit in. This could indicate that you were an outside with your friend group
    or at school, but most often the IC in Aquarius means that you didn’t fit into
    your family system.
  prefs: []

    needed to be like everyone else, to be the *same*. But inside, you always wanted
    to be different.
  prefs: []

    forced to follow the rules of other people, but you never really felt like these
    rules were *right*.

- en: Sometimes IC in Aquarius can mean that you had a detached parent. You may have
    wanted more from them emotionally, but all you received was the cold shoulder.
    You probably felt like they never really saw *you.*

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you were forced to conform and be just like everyone else, but
    deep down, you knew you were different. The IC in Aquarius is a common placement
    for Starseeds or Indigo children because they aren’t able to express their true
    natures.
  prefs: []

- en: You were taught that your differences were bad and that you needed to act like
    others, even if you didn’t feel like that was your most authentic self. You probably
    learned to judge your differences and to be ashamed of them, even if you weren’t *born*
    with that natural shame.

- en: Much of the IC in Aquarius placement means that you didn’t fit in to *culture*.
    Try to remember that if you were born at a different time, you would have been
    the star of the show. The judgments that you learned about yourself are a reflection
    of your culture and of society, not of who you are inside.

    You weren’t able to follow your heart; instead, you had to follow the rules that
    made sense to others.

    you probably go after it! In fact, your ambitions become a core part of who you
    are. You want to be recognized for the things that you *alone* achieve.

    unless you’re “shining.” Be careful that you don’t start to base your self-worth
    on *others* noticing your good qualities. This is the most difficult aspect of
    this placement.
  prefs: []

    The natural impulse is to seek recognition from other people. This is biologically
    hardwired into us!

    your dreams!

    doesn’t mean that your Midheaven in Leo is negative; it simply means that you
    can’t run from the shame of your childhood forever.

    reactions were their *own*. They were not influenced by you, nor did your “different”
    energy truly mean that you were different in a bad way.

    that Midheaven in Leo is all about self-love and about opening your heart, even
    if you still feel small inside. It’s about accepting yourself for exactly who
    you are. You don’t need to change to be successful.

    that are favorable in nature and are located within the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th
    house, then a person will feel as though he or she has an important place within
    society. They may also be considered powerful and have a higher level of prestige
    than other members of their profession.

    10th, 5th or 7th houses indicates that we have a strong desire to perform career
    related tasks in life and also that we possess the ability to make progress towards
    our worldly goals.

    a successful family and they will have the benefit of being able to acquire all
    of the support that they need in order to make progress in life.

    the unconscious mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    area of our life, so aspects to the IC will often indicate that we either have
    control over our unconscious mind or that we are susceptible to its whims. Of
    course, the outcome will depend on the level of evolvement that any given individual
    possesses.
