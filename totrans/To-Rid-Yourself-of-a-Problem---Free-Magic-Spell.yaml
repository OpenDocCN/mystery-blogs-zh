    of the Waning Moon, and makes use of the Elements to symbolize completion.

    Throw the shoe into the stream of water and watch it disappear. Or; Throw the
    shoe into the sea and walk away. As any of these happen, visualize the problem
    getting less and less until it disappears.

- en: Often during this time inspiration may come to you as to how you can deal with
    the difficulty. The reason that you use the right shoe is because this is considered
    the more positive and assertive side of the body, which is normally the one needed.
    However, if it feels more natural to use the left shoe the result will usually
    be more passive and non- confrontational.

    You can add to this and transform it into a spell, but as outlined, this does
    not work. I would write your troubles on a piece of paper, fold it away from you
    then destroy it. You could burn it, bury it off your property, or toss it into
    a moving stream of water. Be sure to take the long way home and do not look back.
    Otherwise, the energy can follow you home. Once home, cleanse and protect to keep
    it away. If you wish for a solution, meditate with a yellow candle.
