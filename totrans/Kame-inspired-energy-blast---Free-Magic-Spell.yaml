- en: '**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following
    items for this spell:**Stand outside in horse stance. Concentrate on the energy
    that flows trough your body and around you. Imagine it like a fluid. Now Firmly
    hold both hands half open and half closed facing each other and just a few inches
    apart in front of your solar plexus. Take a soft breath then after breathing it
    out take a strong breath. Remember to breath with both your chest and your stomach,
    that way the energy flows through your vagas nerve.'

- en: Keep breathing at a slow, steady pace to obsorb the energy around you, to better
    concentrate the energy within, and to summon all of the energy that is deep within
    you. At this point imagine all the energy centralized at your core. Now, pull
    your hands apart and bring them around clockwise if you're right-handed (or counter
    clockwise if you're left-handed) bringing them around so your dominant hand is
    on top and the other on the bottom keeping them about a foot apart and facing
    each other again. Once you feel ready take all of the energy you have summoned
    and visualize it beaming through you like a beam of great energy both forward
    and back. Push your hands forward and shift your stance with it having your palms
    face away from you while having all that energy shoot forward, and yell or shout
    out as you do. The Kame shout does nicely, but you can just shout or yell.

    cast for strangers as it goes against my code of ethics.
