    spell I wrote based on blood magick traditions. I guess you can consider this
    a potion

    end blah blah blah etc.

- en: This may be a little late, but this is somewhat concerning as a spell. I do
    enjoy blood magic, but it is so very important to be as sterile as possible, not
    just ''cleaned'' but autoclaved. (that's just a general on blood work, even if
    it is a few drops, if you're going to make any controlled cut, it should be clean
    as possible). secondly, do not give anyone your body fluids! Even if it is, again,
    a few drops, it is very unethical and in some places even illegal to have somebody
    consume your blood (or other things that are produced from your body) without
    their knowledge. I'd strongly advise against doing this, if anything, think about
    what would happen if they found out, even myself being a devout wiccan I would
    feel repulsed if my girl friend did this. The disclaimer at the bottom of the
    site is a pretty good warning. Do use common sense and don't ingest what doesn't
    seem safe (or make others ingest)

- en: if you use blood in any type of spell if It's used for a food spell or of the
    likes I would recommend getting tested for diseases and the works also the safe
    amount of blood for a human to consume is about a tablespoon. and if u do this
    spell please use a sterilized needle or knife and clean the wound after. and be
    careful blessed be every one ^ ^
