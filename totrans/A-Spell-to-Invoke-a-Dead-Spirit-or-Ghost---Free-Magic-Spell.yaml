    a bowl of thyme. This candle will serve as a beacon to guide the spirit towards
    the witch, and the heat of the flame will provide energy to help the ghost manifest.
    Here is the **incantation to invoke a dead spirit**:'

    back from the shadows into the light** **and show yourself here.** Several witches
    and mediums have a natural facility to sense or even see spirits. For those who
    have not yet developed this talent, the presence of a ghost has some distinctive
    signs: the air gets colder, and there may be drafts, noise or spontaneous movement
    of objects. Some ghosts communicate directly with witches, telepathically transmitting
    their words and images, others fail to do so and need a way to express themselves
    physically, such as a Ouija board. During your time with the spirit, you must
    not forget that this is a human being who is entitled to the same respect and
    courtesy as a living being. At the end of the session, you must thank the ghost
    and say goodbye, and it is also polite to use a formula to deliver them from the
    physical world and help them return to the afterlife: **You who lived yesterday,**
    **Thank you,** **Now fly away from this earth** **and join the world of spirits.**'
