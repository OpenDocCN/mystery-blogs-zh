*   pentacle (optional)

 A pentcle is a five pointed star that keeps bad spirits/energy away from you. 

First put on your pentcle if you have one. 

Second place the candles in the correct spots making a star with you in the middle. Make sure there is enough room for you to be in the middle, the candles ar evenly spaced, and you don't catch on fire. 

Place the candles as so: 

- White on top

- blue to the right

- yellow to the left

- red to the lower right

- green to the lower left

Now light each candle starting from the white candle down (any order will do but lighting the white candle first gives respect to spirit). 

Now sit either criss-cross or on your legs. Make sure you're alone and your mind is clear. You don't have to but while you chant the first line you can make a pentcle with your arm movements if it helps. 

Chant: 

Fire, Spirit, Earth, Water, and Air

Free me from any negative energies that try to interfere

Bless my body and my soul

Allow me to have full control

May the elements protect me for all eternity

So I have said it, so it shall be 

Now blow out the candles in any order but make sure fire (red) is the second to last or is the last to blow out and spirit (white) is either last or second to last to blow out. It is more respectful to blow out the fire candle second to last and the spirit candle last.
