    will come with you though it is suggested that you do not bring a lot of things
    or any other living things. This is the same for anything you might get in the
    other world.
  prefs: []

    with you if you do the spell with a friend(they have a key necklace and chant
    with you) there won't be any negative side effects and it should work just fine.

    everything, I wanted to go to the Harry potter world, did it not work because
    I had something attached to the chain, it was a necklace, but I had a key on it
    too, or did I just not visualize enough or do I need to have more belief?

- en: You aren't able to travel to another world with a spell, especially not a fantasy
    or made up world. Although many practitioners believe in alternate planes of existance,
    you can't travel into another world like this.
  prefs: []

- en: well,harry potter may only exist in the film. Harry Potter world doesn't exist
    in our real world. Besides,remember that film is completely different from real
    magick.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the contrary HearthWitch it is very possible to travel from one plane of
    existence to another with magic because magic is simply the ability to control
    and alter the energy that makes up the universe, You simply need to have a lot
    of patience, will power, and believe that magic can do anything, and then you
    can do anything you can imagine with magic.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a physical door to step through. You project your astral form out of your physical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nice username reference, JustMonika. Your comment doesn't really mean the spell
    works, however. Nekoshema is completely correct, physical travel in this way is
    simply not possible. Also the multiverse is a hypothesis, not a proven fact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to travel to a different world, try shifting :) I can't explain it
    very well but it's kinda like lucid dreaming except you're actually there. You
    go to sleep and one way or another get brought into a different reality where
    you can touch, smell, and taste everything there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As it's been said before, nobody's being a hater, they're teaching people the
    difference between real and fake magick because there's a ton of misinformation
    and newbie witches can't tell the difference because witchcraft is such a vast
    ocean of things its difficult to know where to begin. Especially if you spent
    your life up until this point watching media that portrays magick as sparks flying
    from wands and witches riding on broomsticks. [being told that's not real magick
    can be a bummer, but it's better you learn reality on day one instead of years
    down the line when your spells all fail and you give up in a huff] Also, side
    note, nobody's going to stop you if you read all of these explanations and go
    ''Forget you people, I'm going to cast this anyway!'' My old history teacher used
    to say there are 3 types of people. You tell a group of students the stove is
    hot and don't touch it. The first group will take you at your word and never touch
    the stove. The second type will hear what you said, but still touch the stove
    to be sure [his favourite type to teach, and I agree] but the third type is the
    worst type of student. They will deny the stove it hot, touch the stove, get burned,
    then touch the stove again and keep hurting themselves because they refuse to
    admit the stove is hot. Everyone you think is a ''hater'' is simply saying ''The
    stove is hot, don't touch'' and whatever you choose to do is up to you.

    help those who are not as experienced in the craft.

    to guide and help you in your journey of life. Study things like the hermetica,
    the emerald tablets of Thoth, etc. and I PROMISE, you will be able to see the
    world far more clearly than you ever though was possible. NOTHING is impossible
    as long as you believe, but always remember, that the universe rewards hard work.
