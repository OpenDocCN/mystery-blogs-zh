    herbs, or incenses, set them up.**'
  prefs: []

- en: A few ideas for this ritual can be to Anoint some (commonly purple, blue, or
    white...but whatever color resonates to you is best) candles with oils such as
    lavender, mhyrrh, cedarwood, meditation oil, etc., Put some herbs in an incense
    charocal burner, or on a candle and light it., Make some tea from the edible herbs
    and flowers you collected
  prefs: []

- en: This is to set the tone, and enhance the energy. Although none of these tools
    are required, having the ritualistic aethetic and stimuli can not only bring forth
    deeper layers of energy, but also connect us more to the elements for more powerful
    connection to self.

    Try to find a position that can be consistent for you, even if it means inconsistency.
    In other words, learn to work with your body to understand how it behaves and
    how to best relax it.'

    as you breath in and out, your Third Eye breaths in and out with you. As if you
    are breathing through it.** Lay your focus to your Third Eye, the are between
    the bridge of your nose, and the mid of your forehead (or, between/above your
    eyebrows).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Draw all your focus, allowing your mind to focus on simply focusing on that.
    No more, no less. Nothing but allowing natural awareness to shift. **Keep at this
    until you feel as if your awareness of consciousness is set here at your third
    eye. As if you experience life through it.** To hold onto or tap into this, you
    must release the need or urgency to. Allow it, and just experience. Don't analyze
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once your focus is set, while you're breathing in through your Third Eye, feel
    it pulsating through the breaths. Do this for 10 minutes.

- en: '**Part 3\. (At least 10 minutes  each**) After allowing yourself to activate
    and exercise your awareness to your intuitive eye, **close your eyes, and allow
    your intuition to run wild. Imagine anything you want.** The idea is to make it
    as vivid as possible. It''s best to run through your imaginings slowly, fully
    analyzing them with all your senses and emotions. Really buy into the world you
    create in your head. Even if this start small like an apple...or blurry. Even
    if you find yourself falling asleep (which is why sitting upright on the floor
    can help), its not about how "well" it is done, but about how committed to exploring
    this part of your consciousness you are.'

- en: '**Next, after you''ve ran through your imagination, allow your mind to center
    back,** clearing it of all the noise, breathing into your 3rd eye. **Now this
    time, allow your imagination to be open, but instead of directing it, let it direct
    you.** See where it takes you, what it shows you....very much like a dream that
    you are lucid in, but instead a meditation where you are vividly involved. Don''t
    analyze anything you see, even as far as to take note of the colors. Just experience
    it.'

- en: '**Part 4.** When you have finished and woken from your mind, **write down all
    that you can recall from what you''ve seen.** If you struggle to recall, it''s
    normal and okay. Like a muscle, dream/vision/meditation recall needs to be exercised
    and trained. Try to write dow everything from the smells that stood out, faces
    you saw, colors you noticed, emotions you felt, or even just remanents of ideas
    of what you think you remember. Anything. If you can, try to have a notebook for
    this specifically to further establish ritual and routine, but also to have one
    set place to channel that energy.'

- en: This is a third eye exercise but do not focus only on your third eye chakra.
    Your chakras need to be in balance. Start from the root and work up to your crown.
    You need the lower chakras to be balanced so you have a strong foundation. Your
    upper chakras are your spiritual chakras. While people are more drawn to the upper
    chakras, an imbalance will cause problems down the road. You need to ground yourself
    in reality before exploring the spiritual. A third eye that is too open, with
    no lower chakras for support, can result in hallucinations and mental health struggles.
    Have you seen spiritual people go off on rants, making outlandish claims, and
    appearing as if they are either high or having a mental health crisis? That is
    what happens when you focus on the third eye and nothing else. I would do this
    meditation once a week, but work on the other chakras the rest of the week. There
    is nothing wrong with spending a little more time with one chakra. We have trauma
    which can block one more than others. However, far too often, people want psychic
    powers and focus on the third eye. You can strengthen psychic abilities with other
    practices. Do not forget about grounding. There is a reason it is a basic practice.
