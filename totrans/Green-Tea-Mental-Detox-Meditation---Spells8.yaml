- en: As you take a breath in, expand your belly. (pause) When you exhale, relax and
    squeeze your whole body just enough so that the air comes out completely. Don’t
    force it, do it naturally, so that when you inhale you are expanding, and when
    you exhale you are contracting a little. Do it once more (pause).

- en: Now, take a sip of your tea. Bring your attention to the present moment. Take
    another sip and imagine that this green tea is a gatekeeper of consciousness.
    It lets some thoughts in and leaves others out. Green tea is helping you focus
    on this moment alone.

- en: The past simply does not exist, we can no longer change it. And the future does
    not exist either, since we are totally unaware of it. Remain fully focused on
    the present. Any event, any small stimulus that comes from the present, is welcome
    and we let it enter our consciousness. It could be a sounds from the outside,
    from the next room. It could be a body sensation, your breath, an itch…

    of your tea. (pause) Green tea is already making you alert.

- en: Now, place your attention on the third-eye once more. Inhale and exhale through
    your nose, into your belly. Keep observing the breath throughout. As we breath
    in, we focus even more, and as we exhale, we relax the body more.

    time. This is something that you will develop as you do more and more meditations.

    all those plans about the future… Having left out so many things, you will be
    in a state of peace that is normally hidden because we are usually thinking about
    what happened, or making assumptions about what will happen.

- en: The present is simple, it can be rich in stimuli, but it is simple. There is
    no fear, and no hope. If your attention starts to go towards an emotion or a thought,
    if you become distracted, then focus again on the belly breath.

    open your eyes and get in touch with the outside world.
