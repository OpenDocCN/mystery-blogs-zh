    magick that she enacts specifically for the planet to facilitate its ongoing wellbeing.
    The second is magick that’s centered around natural objects. This article addresses
    the former — ideas about those spells, rituals, and other spiritual methods we
    devise specifically for [**Gaia**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witches-garden/goddess-gardens-gaia-earth-garden/).

- en: While most people would never think of just randomly tossing their trash on
    a friend’s lawn, for hundreds of years that’s pretty much what humankind has been
    doing to the earth. At some point we stopped thinking of the Earth as sacred and
    began treating it as our domain, not seeing the long-term effects of such neglect
    until recently. Nonetheless it seems that some of our wise ancestors left us clues
    as to how we should think about and treat the earth both substantively and spiritually.
    The Earth Witch or [**Green Witch**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/wicca-wiccan/types-of-wicca-green-wicca/)
    uses those concepts as a starting point for the way in which he not only weaves
    magic but also the way in which he lives.

    trees having souls. Saint Anthony told us that nature was God’s “open book” and
    Saint Francis basically became the patron of ecologists through his ardent love
    and care for wildlife. It was he who spoke of Mother Earth as nourishing humans
    (and we suspect he meant more than our bodies!). And these people are not alone.
    Numerous well-respected figures, from Jesuit priests and European alchemists to
    nineteenth-century writers and artists like Henry David Thoreau, were trying to
    define this great gift. It just took us a while to really see and hear their messages.

    charter that lays out ways of safeguarding the environment. In 1983 and 1987,
    the religious sector followed suit when the World Council of Churches focused
    on creation’s integrity, and Pope John Paul told Catholics everywhere that human
    “dominion” over the Earth was not absolute and that we must use this treasure
    wisely. Sadly, even after the turn of the millennium, we find some of that focus
    blurred behind other social issues. As spiritual beings, however, we still need
    sound ethical standards for how we treat this world. Our children deserve a whole
    Earth, not whatever remnants we choose to leave behind.'

    clean fuel sources and vote for them. Beyond these kinds of things, don’t forget
    about the power in a Witch’s kit! Create spells, rituals, charms, and meditations

    is a great starting point. As you close your eyes bring the image of the earth
    as it appears from space. Bath that sphere in blue-white light. The light should
    flicker with magical energy as it moves into the atmosphere cleaning up toxins
    in every corner of creation. There is inherent, simple beauty in this visualization.
    For one thing, it helps you really think of the planet as a wholly-connected living
    organism. It also acts as a medium through which you can direct positive spiritual
    energy. Last, it’s a pretty nice image to take with you into your [**dreams**](https://witchcraftandwitches.com/witch/dream-interpretation-for-wiccans-witches-and-pagans/).
