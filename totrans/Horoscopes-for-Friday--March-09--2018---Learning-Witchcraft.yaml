- en: Jupiter begins a retrograde phase on your birthday, which means you need to
    look carefully at the things you value the most. Have you been putting material
    success ahead of emotional security? If so, you may need to do the opposite for
    a while.

- en: According to the planets you have neglected certain work-related obligations
    in recent months and need to make amends to those who have missed out because
    of your neglect. Don’t look on it as a chore, look on it as a matter of honor.

    out a few home truths. Choose your words carefully but choose them for maximum
    impact too. Speak calmly and softly but make sure everyone gets the message.

    the weekend. As Jupiter begins one of its retrograde phases you can no longer
    trust in Lady Luck to look after you. Do you have a long-term plan? If not, get
    one!

    will get what you need and that’s much more important. The universe knows what
    is good for you and if you listen to your heart you will know too.

- en: As Jupiter turns retrograde in your fellow Water sign of Scorpio today it’s
    quite likely you will be put to the test. Confidence is half the battle. Believe
    that you have what it takes to succeed and there are few things that will be able
    to stop you.

    not your friend and must be ignored. You’re a Leo and you’re a winner and opportunities
    to showcase your talents will come thick and fast over the next few weeks.

    limits, so don’t push yourself too hard. Give yourself time to recover from your
    recent exertions and you will soon be on the up again. Virgo is never down for
    long.

    and anxieties. Be that as it may you have an image to live up to and must keep
    your fears to yourself. If others see you panic they will most likely panic too!

    so why are you doing so now? Maybe it’s because you are tired of arguing over
    issues that, deep down, you know are of little importance. Let them believe what
    they like.

    as Jupiter, your ruler, turns retrograde today you may feel you need to tone down
    your aims a little. Nonsense. You’re a Sag, so expect more of yourself, not less!

    keep harking back to the past. Not everyone can be as creative or as concerned
    with the future as you, so make allowances and don’t waste time on petty arguments.
