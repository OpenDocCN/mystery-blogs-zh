    look carefully at the things you value the most. Have you been putting material
    success ahead of emotional security? If so, you may need to do the opposite for
    a while.

    in recent months and need to make amends to those who have missed out because
    of your neglect. Don’t look on it as a chore, look on it as a matter of honor.

    trust in Lady Luck to look after you. Do you have a long-term plan? If not, get
    one!

    quite likely you will be put to the test. Confidence is half the battle. Believe
    that you have what it takes to succeed and there are few things that will be able
    to stop you.

    so why are you doing so now? Maybe it’s because you are tired of arguing over
    issues that, deep down, you know are of little importance. Let them believe what
