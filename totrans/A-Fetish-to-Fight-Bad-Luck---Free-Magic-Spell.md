**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   3 pennies

*   3 pieces of loosely woven cloth (in your lucky color)

Use the string to tie each of the pennies into the cloth while reciting an incantation:

In luck I trust, in luck i believe.
Within this bundle, protection weave!

When you want to activate the fetish, take it to a remote location and put it into the earth, saying:

Bad fortune's come, but not stay.
I command it now to turn away.

Turn away from the bundle and don't look back, leaving all that negative energy behind you.
