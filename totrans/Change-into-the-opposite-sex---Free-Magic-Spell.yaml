    won't do it [if it did I know a number of friends I would of helped to save them

- en: He's not. ''Magic'' and ''Magick'' are two different things. [the spelling determines
    the type you're talking about] Magic with a C is fake [think movies and stage
    magicians] while Magick with a K refers to the spiritual energy real-life witches
    call on. [also, it can be spelled a number of different ways such as magik, majik,
    majic, majick and magique, but magick is the most common way]
