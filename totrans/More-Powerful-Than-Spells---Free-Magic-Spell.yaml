- en: Most spells can be made into thought forms, usually with less effort that doing
    the spell itself. Create a psi ball, name it, instruct it on what its function
    is, and where to draw energy from. And finally what it is to do once its task
    is complete and then send it on its way.

- en: Few if any have enough energy to work our craft alone. We must and should learn
    to draw energy from other sources. Working in a group, we can draw energy from
    the group. There are many more powerful sources that we can and should be utilizing.
    As you are probably aware we can create a thought form and feed it energy to complete
    the function we make it for. There are thousands of very powerful thought forms
    that others have made. We can tap into their energy as well as the four elements,
    the Sun and the Moon can also be used.

    as you can draw in Prana with breathing exercises, you can also draw in other
    energy, Mana from the Earth, energy from fire and water, and as mentioned before
    from powerful thought forms.

- en: As you see it is not that hard and none of the magical tools and rituals are
    needed. Being the thought form has its own energy source it will be more effective
    than any spell that only has the energy available that was used when it was cast.
    It is not hard to convert most spells into a thought form. I believe that you
    will find that they are easier and more effective than spells.

    you should be presently surprised. Remember the rules of three still apply and
    will come back harder than ever if you use it to alter ones free will or to do
    harm. You are not an agent of Karma, it does not need your help. Seek no revenge,
    hate, wickedness and evil eats into your soul, do not carry them with you. You
    have been warned. Consider your actions carefully before casting any spell or
    creating any thought form.

- en: This practice of creating a thought form is often called a servitor and is basicly
    an A.I.used to Procter a spell for shorter or longer periods of time With practice
    creating a servitor to carry out your craftwork is extremely effective Always
    write down any servitor you create and when you made it and as aislyn stated always
    deconstruct your servitor
