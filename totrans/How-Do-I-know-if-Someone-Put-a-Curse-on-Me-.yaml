    also the potential for darkness and black magick. *Knowing* if someone put a curse
    on you is the first step to doing something about it.

    or perhaps a [salt protection spell](https://spellguru.co/salt-protection-spell/).
    It will do no harm if you *are* cursed but we’ll look at some more specific rituals
    you can also use.

    of someone’s malicious intent. The kind of things that get your attention because
    of how unlikely they were.
  prefs: []

    health problems, money worries, techie issues with your mobile and laptop and
    your car breaking down.

    the curse happening. A close animal might try to move toward you but most will

    family, or colleagues, it may be due to a curse. Negative energy can drag you
    down, lowering your vibration so you just don’t on with people as you normally
    would.

    thrown at the front door, and they would smash, releasing the curse. These days,
    spell jars are used quite differently, but some of the old practitioners will
    still do this, and these traditions are often passed down.

    or symbolize the malicious intent of the person who placed the curse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    herbs that attract negativity are a dead giveaway. Sometimes it’s not always that

    taken from our old Grimoire and updated to modern household items.

    is *far, far easier* than casting it to begin with. If you don’t want to do this
    (for whatever reason) you can always [have us do it for you](https://spellguru.co/change-your-life-spell/).
    Or ask someone you’re more familiar with.

- en: Sometimes you won’t have to do anything. Malice is hard to keep up and hate
    often burns hot but fizzles out. A curse will often fizzle as soon as the caster
    can’t keep this focus up so you could just wait it out.
