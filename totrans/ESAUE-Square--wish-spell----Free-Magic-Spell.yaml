    based on my goal - like cinnamon for love though as an example) a candle to the

    minerals to the south (again, it depends on the goal - gold dust works for a money
    spell) and water to the west (again, use materials by unstict based on goals -
    lavender extract could be placed in the water for health or love)

    what your goal is with the spell. On one side draw, paint or (possibly) write
    in verse what it is that you want to happen. The important part is the raw emotion
    connected to the artistic act.
