## Casting Instructions for 'Restore Peace to an Unhappy Home'

 Light Deity Candles and the incense. Sit and meditate on the goal to be accomplished. Light the Astral Candles of those in the home, which are placed approximately 13" from each other.

Think hard of each person, saying as the Candles are lit, "This candle represents . As it burns, so burns his/her spirit." Write down the faults and problems that beset the home. Discuss them with the others.

Then light the Votive Candle, visualizing the start of a new day and new turn for the better, e.g. visualize turning over an old brown leaf and finding it green and vibrant on the other side. Light the Yellow-Green Candle (for Anger, and Jealousy and Discord).Say, "Here burns away all negative emotions from and , leaving only love and happiness. It is in our house; it is all about us. There is tranquility in our home. Peace and love abound and are with us. For true happiness now is known. Understanding and love are there in abundance; discord and chaos are fled. For be it ever thus, that as patience and love do grow and prosper, so barren become the fields of doubt and distress. Happiness is the light that burns and darkness all away is sent. The home is peace; peace is the home."

Meditate for 3-5 minutes on settling the disturbed conditions in the home. Now hold up the paper containing the problems, and burn it in the Votive Candle. Visualize all the problems vanishing. Move the Astral Candles closer to each other. Light the Black Candle (for Destruction of Negativity). Repeat the words, then meditate for 3-5 minutes on the problems having gone.

Move the Astral Candles further closer to each other. Light the Light Blue Candle (for Peace and Understanding). Finally repeat the words once more, then meditate for another 3-5 minutes on the new peaceful condition of the home. Move the Astral candles even closer to each other. Hug and kiss each other and call out "Hurrah" or other such words expressing joy and relief and victory. Then extinguish the Votive Candle, and then the Astral and Day candles.

Note: The spell is even more powerful if it is repeated on 3 consecutive days, with different day candles, and letting the Astral candles touch each other only at the third incantation on the third day. There is no need to write down the problems on the second or third day. However, the spell may be only performed once, in which case, the Astral candles should touch other at the third incantation. The ashes of the "problem paper" can be gleefully flushed down the toilet.

This can work, but I would include everyone in the home if possible. I would also cleanse the home to remove any lingering negative energy. A spring cleaning would also help.
