# Draw Love Into Your Home (Love Spell)

Love spell difficulty: Low Time to Cast: Under an hour There are many different versions of this one around, but I still feel like it's worth sharing, simply due to the ease of creating it (Everything is very easy to get a hold of)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Draw Love Into Your Home (Love Spell)'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   Find a container around your home, (I have found that using one of significance works better, like an old one passed down, or something handcrafted) and take that container and put in it the following things:

*   Pieces of yourself: Hair, Blood (If you would prefer to skip this step, that's fine) and an eyelash.

*   2 Pieces of Quartz

*   Cleansed Water

*   Fully Developed Leaf

*   Lavender
