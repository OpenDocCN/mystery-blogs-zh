    as a symbol of constancy, strength and certainty. Nations like Germany so revered
    the Oak that they made it the national tree. Various states in the US have done
    likewise. When you stand or sit beneath a glorious Oak it’s easy to see why people
    held this tree in such high regard. There’s a peaceful spirit in those roots that
    seems to just know it’s exactly where it needs to be.

    A person wearing Oak leaves (real or in a decorative design) was always someone
    of status. The Celtic word for Oak is “duir” which many linguists believe is the
    source from which the term Druid. Duir also means door, implying that the Oak
    Tree opens a path to other realms and levels of awareness.

    The Celts associated lightning with Dagda, the God of magic, wisdom, strength
    and fertility. Seeing an Oak struck by lightning was akin to having God, himself
    say, “LOOK HERE!” Even after a strike, many oaks live to be over 100 years of
    age (the oldest staying true until 200). Talk about the perfect emblem of longevity.

    near oaks when they wanted to encourage goodwill, bless their warriors with strength
    and when seeking out the truth. Those people found lying faced punishment, the
    worst of which was banishment from the clan, never to return. So Oak symbolizes
    honesty and proper intent, particularly that which comes with oaths and promises.

    Interestingly enough Zeus is known for his lightning bolts that Oak seems to attract.
    Energetically Oak is very strong but rather cantankerous. It does not give way
    like the willow and is susceptible to damage as a result. The Oak’s lesson here
    is that we must learn to adapt and change with our environment.

- en: Much of the Metaphysical associations for the Oaktree come from global myths,
    lore, superstitions and beliefs. We begin with the Greeks and Romans who associated
    Oak with the Olympian Gods and Goddesses. One of the oracles in Donona was established
    with a black dove arrived from Egypt and made a home in an Oak tree there. This
    tree became the center of a temple where priests would come to listen to the rustling
    of the Oak’s leaves for answers to important community questions and judgements.
    This leaves us with the wonderful symbolism of the Oak as a divinatory wood (perhaps

    very heavy and dense. Upon cutting it has a medium coarse texture. The grain pattern
    is tight and straight, which makes it hard for a stain to penetrate it. By comparison,
    Red oak is not as hard or heavy. Nonetheless, it’s good for carving and takes
    to both sanding and finishing quite well.
