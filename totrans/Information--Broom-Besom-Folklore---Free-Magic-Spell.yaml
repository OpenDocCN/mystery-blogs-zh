- en: The old picture of the witch riding around on the broom's stick casting magic
    spells is believed to have come from a agricultural fertility rite, where the
    women rode around the fields(like on a hobby horse), with the broom between their
    legs, hoping to bring the farmers a good harvest.

- en: Jumping the Broom -Many pagan traditions have the bridal couple, jump across
    the broom, a symbol of fertility (old bit of agricultural fertility magic), to
    signify the establishment of their new household. The brooms are usually decorated
    for the occasion and then kept in a place of honor in the home. In many Wicca
    handfasting(marriage) rituals, couples often jump over the broom if they want
    children. historically, brooms made great gifts for weddings or handfastings.
    Just add a little ribbon, some flowers, and your are good to go. No wrapping needed.
    Every new home needs a new broom!

- en: The Ritual Broom -Witches use brooms in magick and ritual. The pagan broom or
    "besom" is used in ritual for cleansing the general circle or ritual area. The
    besom is sweeping away the psychic dirt, getting the area purified for the ritual
    at hand. A Witch may begin a ritual by sweeping the area with the magick broom,
    visualising the psychic dirt being swept out of the ritual area. The sweeping
    also helps to get the mind ready for the ritual, quieting the mind and narrowing
    the focus for the witch. The besom is a purifier and is related to the element
    of Water.

    occultists that they were resident, or at work, by placing a besom (broom) outside
    the door. This is NOT to say that anyone who has a kitchen broom sitting outside
    their door is a witch.
