# Call a Spirit from Mirror

  Rated 5/5 Stars

Me and my friend made this up. We wrote 666 in the mirror and bugs were flying out after the spell was cast.(Blood and 666 or any other writings OPTIONAL)

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Call a Spirit from Mirror'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   As many candles as possible, surrounding you and any other person, co particular color.

*   A mirror

*   A knife/razor

*   Time: Night

*   Salt

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   As many candles as possible, surrounding you and any other person, co particular color.

*   A mirror

*   A knife/razor

*   Time: Night

*   Salt

 Start off in a well-lighted room. Light all the candles and turn off the lights. Once there is enough wax, splash the mirror with wax. Sprinkle salt around the mirror and yourself. Set up the candles around you, and be very quiet. Once the was is dry, with the knife/razor (be careful not to scratch the mirror) carve in the wax the type of spirit/demon whatever... psychic/family member/demon/any other spirit. OPTIONAL, not suggested: with the knife/razor put some of your blood on the mirror. Now chant:

> **"Witches corse through time, we are in need of assistance.
> Oh spirit come, we beckon you. Share your stories, come intill the morning light."**

Wait about 30 seconds, still quiet, and then ask for a sign of being. If you want, you can ask it questions through forms of you asking, the spirit knocking.  **USE CAUTION** because if you do choose to use blood or put 666, be aware of the dangers. For us, there were bugs appearing out of nowhere. After you're done, clean up the mess, like wax and anything else off the mirror.
