    we call witchcraft today **likely had completely different names** throughout
    different time periods. All manner of magickal practice has been demonized at
    one point in history or another, whether deserved or not. In this post, we will
    focus solely on witchcraft with European roots.

    made the claim that **all magick, whether illusion or sorcery, was created by
    the Devil** in order to lure people away from the church. However, he also made
    the claim that witches held no real power and so the church shouldn’t be concerned
    with hunting down witches for trials. This belief was held by the church for many
    years.

    a form of heresy. For example, in 1401, the English parliament enacted what was
    called *de heretico comburendo*^([[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_heretico_comburendo)),
    Latin for “regarding the burning of heretics”, which punished all heretics by
    burning them at the stake. This encompassed all heretics, not just witchcraft,
    but it was the strictest law on heresy at the time.

    **it is estimated that a majority of those executed for witchcraft were women**.
    In 1692, the United States saw the beginning of the Salem Witch Trials where more
    than 200 people were accused of witchcraft. This led to 30 guilty verdicts, 20
    executions, and several deaths in jail.
