    through their trauma or negative karma with the mother figure. With this aspect,
    lessons that you learn from your mother will naturally push you toward soul growth,
    even if the lessons are painful, but you can accelerate this process by taking
    an active position in your own growth and pushing to learn about your feelings.

    are always pushing you to grow. Be careful that you don’t get stuck in just feeling
    the emotions. With the trine, there is a tendency to simply be swept away by the
    negative emotions and patterns. Sometimes, this aspect can even indicate that
    you get a bit stuck emotionally and don’t really grow after the initial trauma
    has been experienced.
