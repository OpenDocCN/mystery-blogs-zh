- en: In the natal chart, Moon-Nodal aspects indicate that you have a karmic relationship
    with your mother or caretaker. Most likely, you had a similar relationship in
    a past life, and you are here to deal with your karmic issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    whether the energy is helpful or difficult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or skills that you acquired in a past life, and indicate how your emotions will
    help you reach your soul’s purpose during this lifetime.

    South Node aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Moon conjunct North Node placement means that you tend to revert back to
    logic and reason instead of truly dealing with your emotions. You’re very good
    at shutting your emotions down, because your old wounds feel painful.
  prefs: []

    as overly-emotional, you definitely don’t know how to deal with your emotions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moon conjunct North Node indicates that you don’t know how to control your feelings
    in a healthy way because you have trauma surrounding the idea of nurture. This
    probably comes from a mother figure and may stem from a past life, your current
    life, or both.
  prefs: []

    to love every part of yourself, you will notice that you also learn more about
    your emotions and how to handle them.
  prefs: []

    *not* mean ignoring them. Instead, face your feelings and deal with what you’re
    feeling so that you can move on.
  prefs: []

    for family. You want someone to care for you, yet it’s hard to move beyond your
    old patterns of ignoring these emotional needs.

    South Node aspect, although this isn’t always the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    mother or mother figure. However, this aspect won’t necessarily tell you whether
    the relationship is easy or difficult, even though the trine is usually good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some way, your relationship with your mother taught you how to use your emotions
    constructively. The relationship may be painful emotionally, but these lessons
    allowed you to learn how rely on your emotions and intuition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably instinctively know that your emotions are important if you have
    the Moon trine North Node aspect. However, your emotions may still be difficult
    for you, so this aspect doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re good at *expressing*
    your feelings, only that you recognize the importance of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    centered around the ideas of nurture, security, and your emotional needs. These
    are often quite painful karmic lessons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in your early life, contributes to soul growth. This is a natural process as long
    as you’re dealing with your emotions and working through difficult feelings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the more you grow towards your North Node. Your soul’s work is heavily influenced
    by emotions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best place for people with Moon trine North Node to start is by working
    through their trauma or negative karma with the mother figure. With this aspect,
    lessons that you learn from your mother will naturally push you toward soul growth,
    even if the lessons are painful, but you can accelerate this process by taking
    an active position in your own growth and pushing to learn about your feelings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that even if something feels painful, the emotions that you experience
    are always pushing you to grow. Be careful that you don’t get stuck in just feeling
    the emotions. With the trine, there is a tendency to simply be swept away by the
    negative emotions and patterns. Sometimes, this aspect can even indicate that
    you get a bit stuck emotionally and don’t really grow after the initial trauma
    has been experienced.
  prefs: []

    care.

    you *want* to be cared for, you probably learned from a young age that there were
    emotional issues surrounding nurture, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    issues and karma surrounding nurture, specifically of the emotional nature. You
    must actually do the work to heal; this won’t happen automatically with the sextile.
  prefs: []

    with caretaking *and* being cared for will change altogether as you work through
    the karmic issues that created the Moon sextile North Node aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    blessing and a curse. You are easily able to read your own feelings and listen
    to your gut, but you could also overreact or take on the emotions of other people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important with Moon sextile North Node that you learn how to tune into
    your emotions and use them to your advantage. First, you must heal your karmic
    issues with your mother figure and learn to nurture yourself, then you can delve
    deeper into what *causes* an emotional reaction instead of getting swept away
    by your feelings.
  prefs: []

    that you have emotional patterns from a past life that don’t serve you. You may
    fall into negative emotional cycles that are very difficult to let go of.
  prefs: []

    from your trauma with your mother, some of which is from your past life as well.
  prefs: []

    life was also a mother or maternal figure in your past life. The relationship
    was challenging and you were emotionally damaged, in one or both lifetimes.

    You have a great sense of intuition and emotional understanding; you tend to instinctively
    know what others feel, a skill you developed in a past lifetime. However, you
    won’t necessarily use this for good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people with the Moon conjunct South Node placement turn to addictions to
    cope, or they may become fanatical about their beliefs in order to gain a sense
    of nurture. Otherwise, they may use their sense of emotional intelligence to actively
    manipulate others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of how your Moon conjunct South Node placement manifests, the problem
    is that you don’t have emotional balance. Your sense of anxiety surrounding the
    ideas of nurture, protection, and emotional comfort block you from dealing with
    your emotions in a healthy way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    blocked from discovering your soul’s purpose (the North Node) until you work through
    these emotional issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must learn how to tune into your emotional currents and discover what *you’re*
    feeling. You know how to read other people well and how to avoid your own emotions
    when they’re painful. This may seem like the easy path, but it won’t be good for
    you long term.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, learn emotional coping mechanisms (such as self-soothing) so that you
    can become more emotionally sensitive to *yourself* without losing your sense
    of self-awareness. It’s imperative with Moon conjunct North Node that you deal
    with your unhealthy coping mechanisms and learn how to tune into your emotions
    in a healthy manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the specific wounds you have, and instead of ignoring them, look at the false
    beliefs that you developed about yourself when the wound was created.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to appropriately nurture yourself, in a caring and loving way, so that you can
    then deal with your emotions and move towards your North Node/soul’s purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    life. Your soul clings to this wound, yet your mind avoids looking at it or dealing
    with it, which ultimately blocks your soul from making progress towards your purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    cold or abrupt because you have trouble showing your sensitive, emotional side,
    so you can feel very alone internally.
  prefs: []

    figure specifically. In some way, you felt abandoned by the person who was supposed
    to nurture and care for you.
  prefs: []

    you try to forget about this wound or ignore it, reminders will show up constantly,
    so you can never really escape this pain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this lifetime, you will be forced to deal with these traumatic feelings you
    carry around. You simply can’t escape the pain. If you ignore the emotional self
    (either by rationalizing emotions, debasing your emotions, using drinking or drugs,
    getting angry, etc.) then they will simply come out sideways in extreme reactions
    that you can’t control.

    conscious determination. Healing from the Moon square North Node trauma is *not*
    easy.
  prefs: []

    you probably believed that there was something bad or wrong with you, but you
    need to do the emotional work (inner child work can often be helpful) in order
    to recognize that you exist in perfection, just the way you are.
