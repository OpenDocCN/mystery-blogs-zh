To Sense the Emotional Atmosphere around You

1\. Think of the area around you and the people occupying it.

2\. Sense and feel your awareness extending out to the Emotional States of the area you are trying to sense.

3\. Allow any emotions and/or emotional thoughts to enter your mind now as you keep your awareness extended to the Atmosphere around you.

You will most likely have to work at this a few times to achieve the level of achievement I have come to, as I have been an Empath all my life, thus being able to do this in a flash, even from the start of practicing this technique about 2 years ago.

This technique can also be rearranged to sense a single individuals emotions and feelings, but you must do these 3 things to achieve this altered form of my Empathy technique:

1\. You must focus your thoughts on the individual, similar to the way you focused your thoughts on the Emotional Atmosphere around you in the technique prior to this one.

2\. Sense and feel your awareness extending out to the individual you are trying to sense.

3\. Allow any emotions and/or feelings, emotional thoughts, etc. to enter your heart and/or mind at this point, because whatever you sense in the moment is most likely coming from the individual.

Well, have fun with these 2 techniques but dont use them for malicious purpose, because Karma will come back to bite you in your butt!
