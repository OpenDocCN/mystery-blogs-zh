# The Prayer of Intranquility

  Rated 5/5 Stars

(Hoodoo) To make a former Lover be unable to rest until he/she returns. (WARNING: To be used as a last resort, and is to be taken as ''left-handed'' rootwork, because it defies the reade and robbs a person of their own free will!)

Inscribe the Pink candle with the persons name on it. Annoint the candle with either of the listed oils. Light the candle,and while holding the lit candle in one hand ,and the crucifix in the other ,say:

''O' Intranquil Spirit,you that in hell are wandering and will never reach heaven hear me, O' hear me!
I want you to grasp the five senses of (name of lover) and do not let him rest in peace ,neither seated nor standing,waking nor sleeping,that he should think of seeing me, hearing me, tasting me, and touching me, that he should find himself as desperate as the waters of the seas and as torn as the wind in the storm until he returns to me, that he should run and run until he humbly falls at my feet because nobody will help him,and that neither a divorced woman nor a married woman, a widow nor a young woman shall ever love him, but only me and me alone.
(Name of lover), I conjure you before the cross and God Almighty that you are to run after me as the living after the cross and the dead after the light.
AMEN.''

Place the crucifix on your alter, and then place the candle below the crucifix on your alter. Let the candle burn itself completely out. This person won't rest until they come back to you.

Doing the prayer, and it works through the chant only. I'm waiting on results but I can feel it.
