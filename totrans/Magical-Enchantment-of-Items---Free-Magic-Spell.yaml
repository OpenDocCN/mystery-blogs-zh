- en: Traditionally within faery related folklore iron is said to repel the fae. It
    is largely debated on why this is. One theory suggests fae may have an aversion
    to conductive items. I lean toward the protective properties of iron itself. Old
    folklore involving other protective iron made charms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yea I found it kind of odd that the ritual claimed that iron could be an offering
    to the Fey. I found the ritual online and thought that it would be a good edition
    to our spell book, but thanks for pointing that out.

- en: Sometimes old, bent, used iron items can be seen as a gesture of good will.
    A thing broken or bent is rendered without use, comparable to bending a dead warriors
    sword before he is buried with it. (A dual meaning as it is now useless for revenge,
    and symbolic of instigating peace)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have been working on a theory of iron and why it is hated. In old myths the
    fae came to the world, as the Tuatha de dancing, who warned against and defeated
    the fomorri by using creative nature and magic against the fomorian's more destructive
    natural elements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then man came and warned with the Tuatha, defeating them and driving them to
    the otherworld with iron weapons and armor, refined nature resilient against natural
    elements and magic. Which led to man taking over, in effect, because of superior
    technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So essentially my theory is that iron doesn't directly harm the fae, but it
    represents a superior weapon that creates a significant advantage. And so is feared.
    Akin to walking into a feudal hall for a round of trade negotiations, and presenting
    the group with an assault rifle. They are going to fear and, by default, mistrust
    you for the threat you pose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But bring the same weapon with you, with them understanding what it is, then
    disassemble it in front of them and lay the pieces on the table. You are actively
    representing yourself as a non-threat. Making yourself willfully unarmed and vulnerable.
    An honorable gesture of wanting to act in good faith and from equal footing.

- en: Spirit76, I really enjoy your theory. From my understanding, iron was the churches
    answer to keeping the fae away. They had to show the people that their god was
    the most powerful. Their iron gates and crosses were determined to keep ''evil''
    fairys away. I have asked the fae in the past with a variety of answers, the most
    common being ''how dare you ask'' so I have not asked in a long time. I feel it
    does hurt them to some degree, but I think it is more of an insult from centuries
    ago they have yet to forgive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While some fae might appreciate a well maintained garden with a few treats for
    them, the majority do not. Plant a garden and decorate it, avoiding iron obviously,
    but building them a house and leaving offerings can be viewed as insulting. If
    you are in your garden and you brought lunch, leaving some is fine, but do not
    say it is an offering to the fae. Leave it on a rock, or pour it on the ground,
    as a gift to the land and the creatures who live on it. Once you get to know a
    fairy you can you discuss gifts, and even then I would research the species first.
    Some are repelled by gifts and it is how you remove them from your home. Fairy's
    are not all tiny children dancing around with butterfly wings. They can be very
    dangerous if you are not careful. Do your research on ancient fairy lore before
    attempting to build a fairy garden for them.
