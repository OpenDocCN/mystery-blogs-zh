    Watch as its flame flickers, casting dancing shadows around you. Ah, isn''t it

    catches the sun''s rays, a piece of amber that holds ancient sunlight, or even
    a simple mirror. As you hold it, close your eyes and imagine the sun rising over
    a frozen landscape, its golden rays bathing everything in warmth and light. Can
    you feel it? The return of light is near!'

    "As the sun returns, so does the light in my life. I welcome positive energy,
    warmth and illumination into my heart." Feel free to modify these words to suit

    its cyclical nature and constant change. Say something like: "I am thankful for
    the balance of light and darkness, for they remind me that everything has its
    season." Then blow out your candle and sit in silence for a while, letting your
    words and intentions settle.'
