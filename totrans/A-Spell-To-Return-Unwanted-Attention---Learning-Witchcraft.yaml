- en: At some time in your life you’re going to attract the attention of someone you
    wouldn’t want to know. If the person isn’t taking the hint that you don’t want
    them in your life, you should use this spell successfully. You should cast it
    3 days or nights consecutively when the moon is waning. You need fresh vervain
    leaves, but you can always use dried ones that are readily available at a local
    herbalist.

- en: You can always use a handful of either fresh or dried vervain leaves, whatever
    you get your hands on. You should cast the spell outside but indoors works well.
    Since there’s fire involved in the spell, you should be very careful when doing
    it. For the spell, you need vervain leaves, a properly stoked fire. Start by consecrating
    the coal or wood before lighting the fire.

- en: When the fire is properly lit, you should throw the vervain leaves on the flames.
    While doing this, you should call out the name of the person you want out of your
    life loudly and with a lot of passion. Repeat these words once you have said the
    name. ‘I want you not ever, I need you not ever, leave my life now and come back
    never, and let it be done that it harm no one.’

    fire’s smoke, then watch it as it wafts away from you, without a chance of ever
    coming back.
