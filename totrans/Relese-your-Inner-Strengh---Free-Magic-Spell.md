**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   time: midnight

*   clear voice and total concentration.

On a full moon at midnight, go outside and let the moon bathe you in its light. Lift the rose to your heart. Then, lift your head and stare at the moon while chanting...

''Moon, Moon, I call upon you,
Relese my power that is true,
Summon the strengh that lies within me,
and I shall leave you be.''

Repeat this 2 more times.

Your inner strenght should now come to you to wield to your will. It will last till the next full moon. Every full moon you do this, your inner strengh and power will be replenished.

Use it wisely.

WARNING: IF YOU DONT RESPECT THE MOON, THIS SPELL WILL NOT WORK!
TREAT THE MOON THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED!

If this spell does not work, even when you give the moon respect, then you have no inner strengh or magic and should no even be looking at spells.
