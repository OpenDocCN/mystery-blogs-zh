    same length of time. Before you start your ritual, get a compass or map, and see
    which directions are north, south, east and west on your altar or table.

- en: Set up all 4 candles, each one to its proper direction with the book in the
    middle. It's not that important which way the book is sitting as long as the 4
    candles are in the right corners. Allow a little space between the candles and
    your book, or you may end up with drips of candle wax on the cover.
