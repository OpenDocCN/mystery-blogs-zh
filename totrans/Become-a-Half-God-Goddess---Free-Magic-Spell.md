After I am done chanting make the god appear where I am. And tell me the powers I have been given. This will happen at 12:00pm the day after I chanted this spell, So mote it be."

The next day at 12:00pm the God/Goddess you have chosen will appear where you are and talk to you about your powers. Don't be asleep at that time or else you won't become a half God/Goddess

Does this actually work?

Did you even believe anything Nekoshema?

plenty of things, i simply know what is and isn't possible with magick, and this isn't.

You cannot physically transform into a half-deity. You are human in this lifetime, and human you shall remain.
