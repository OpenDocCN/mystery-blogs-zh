- en: Thanks for the links. Looking through this person's website, I get scam vibes
    [like Silver Ravenwolf] I would find other authors to learn from instead of following
    one person. [I say that in general. I have authors I like, but I don't follow
    one persons word completely]

- en: It depends on what you are interested in learning about. I don't want to send
    you books on Wicca when you're interested in rootwork. Outside of beginners guides,
    I read a lot of books either on specific crafting [like potions, hexes, or kitchen
    witchcraft] or books on creating your own path and living your practice. Currently,
    I'm reading Rebel Witch by Kelly-Ann Maddox which is quite good.

- en: I don't think this is fluff. Djinn are spiritual creatures that can be summoned
    by sorcerers for aid in particular areas of life. I highly doubt anyone will not
    be harmed by this spell (even though you don't want them to be harmed), but it
    could manifest in 2 main ways:- 1\. The Djinn will burn it down themselves 2\.
    The Djinn will influence the mind of someone so that they screw up badly and end
    up destroying the building with fire I haven't cast the spell myself, but I think
    this could work
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, do not set buildings on fire, magikally or otherwise. As for this spell,
    I doubt this specific one works, but I have heard a number of tales about Djinn,
    fire elementals (spirits) and curses that with enough energy, you could curse
    the land and/or call on a spiritual being to burn the building down. Granted,
    you would owe them and I would not cross them. Overall, plausible, but I would
    not try it.
