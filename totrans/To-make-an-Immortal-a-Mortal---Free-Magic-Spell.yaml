    to him/her. He/She will be compelled to open it and the small cloud will claim
    their divinity and the rouge angel inhabiting the person will be powerless to
    your magic. The angel will be stuck as a mortal and will have to pay for his/her
    sins like any other human being. Bury the jar where the angel doesn't know.

    in the jar again and reverse the spell you did by saying "Ego ad se vocare quo
    apertus" and break the jar on the land where the spell was done he/she can reclaim
    their powers and divinity and would bring down heavens heavy fist to kick your
    butt.
