- en: This is only one way to summon help from the Elements. You use representations
    of each Element and address the spirits of each element in turn to seek their
    assistance. When you have finished your task each element is then honoured by
    returning it to the earth.

- en: Light the incense and the candle. Bear in mind as you do so at this stage that
    you are making use of the Elements of Fire and Air. Call upon the power of these
    Elements. Ask for their help in the work you are about to do.

- en: 'Use your own words preferably but do keep it simple. You might say for Fire
    something like: "I request your presence, Oh Spirit of Fire I ask for your help,
    your power I require". For Air your words might be: "Come to me now, Oh Spirit
    of Air I pray above all for a mind that is clear" Lift the bowl of salt and likewise
    invoke the powers of the Earth Element. Say perhaps: "Approach now I pray, spirit
    of Earth Help I do need, and prove now my worth". Do the same with the water and
    say: "Come to me now, Oh, Spirit of Water My feelings are clear your strength
    is now sought for."'

- en: When you have finished, sprinkle the salt or sand on the earth, pour the water
    onto the earth, bury the ashes of the incense and snuff out the candle. This is
    not a spell as such, but more preparation for magical working. Whereas you can
    cast a circle within which to carry out your more important workings this allows
    you to set up a sacred space very quickly.
