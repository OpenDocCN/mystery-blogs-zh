## Mercury Opposition Ascendant

You require a lot of mental stimulation with Mercury opposition Ascendant. However, you mainly find this through one-on-one interactions with other people.

Communication is extremely important to you in a relationship. You want a partner who you can debate and chat with. 

In fact, you tend to figure out what you’re really thinking when you can talk about it with someone else. Similar to the conjunction, you need to get your ideas *out* with Mercury opposition Ascendant.

There are some distinct differences from the conjunction. The main divergence is that you use your partner as a mirror for your own inner ideas.

With Mercury opposition Ascendant, you might struggle to figure out exactly what *you* think, so you need to hear the opinions of others. You don’t know that you believe something until it’s presented to you and it feels right.

Your shadow self is especially hidden with Mercury opposition Ascendant. You don’t always know what your deepest self wants and feels, and with Mercury on your Descendent, you struggle to activate the logical part of the brain.

Because your Mercury tends to be subconscious with Mercury opposition Ascendant, you take on the opinions of other people. You want to hear a variety of conclusions before making your own, but this can also mean that your thoughts are only a reflection of those around you.

With Mercury opposition Ascendant, it’s very important that you learn to access your shadow side and develop your *own* opinions.

As you grow and develop your shadow side, you will get better at *hearing* others’ opinions without *believing* them. You must learn how to consider an idea and see if it feels right to *you*.

This will happen naturally as you access your shadow self. Mercury opposition Ascendant is all about a “hidden” logical mind that you want to develop.

However, you can also be a bit cold in relationships, or you may attract dispassionate partners who are overly intellectual. Once you heal your shadow self, you will access your emotional side or will attract partners who can meet you on that level.

Keep in mind that with Mercury opposition Ascendant, an intellectual partnership will be very important for you. In a relationship, you need to be able to chat and discuss ideas with your significant other.

You may also want an active relationship in some sense. The sign that your Mercury is in will dictate more of how this manifests, but you certainly won’t want to be bored with your partner.

Sometimes, Mercury opposition Ascendant can indicate that you might attract partners who are two-faced or impish in some way. Mercury can be a bit tricky, so you need to be careful that you’re seeing the truth.

You will know what’s real when *logic* lines up with your *intuition*.

## Mercury Square Ascendant

Mercury square Ascendant can be a difficult aspect socially. You come across as too opinionated, loud, or arrogant, regardless of your true intentions.

You tend to have trouble communicating. When you want to express something, you may find that it comes out *wrong* or sideways with Mercury square Ascendant.

With Mercury square Ascendant, you have very strong opinions, so you may not take the time to listen to other people. It’s easy for you to show that your thoughts and ideas are more important than anyone else’s.

Although you feel strongly about your thoughts, this sort of conversation style makes you hard to be around. In fact, Mercury square Ascendant can make you a bit egotistical socially. You seem both aggressive *and* unsure of yourself all at once.

Mercury square Ascendant can mean that your body language throws people off. It doesn’t always match up with what you’re saying, so it’s difficult for others to read your social cues.

I know that everything I have said about Mercury square Ascendant sounds super harsh. However, most of these issues arise because you don’t feel confident about who you are inside.

Everything that you do socially is a defense mechanism to try and boost your own confidence. Mercury square Ascendant indicates a strong lack of *intellectual* self-assurance.

Mercury square Ascendant means that you might compare yourself to other people. This creates a lot of deep insecurity that bubbles up in social situations.

Your judgments towards others are a defense mechanism, even if this is all subconscious or even unconscious.

With Mercury square Ascendant, you need to boost your own confidence *inside* before your social skills will change. You search for assurance from others yet the only person who can truly give you want you seek is *you*.

It will take you a lot of time and effort to gain self-confidence. This comes through knowing who you are and what positive qualities you have, regardless of what other people think.

When you’re able to feel true to yourself, you either won’t trigger people socially (because you won’t need to brag or shut others down) or you simply won’t care if other people don’t like you. Usually, it will be a combination of both.
