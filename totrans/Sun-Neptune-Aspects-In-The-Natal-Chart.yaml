    you don’t have as many natural psychic shields. You may feel a weak sense of self-identity,
    controlled by external forces, a sense of loss about who you are, or you may even
    take on the emotions of other people.

    the energetic connections completely.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are always at odds. Many of these issues stem from childhood interactions with
    your father.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    know quite where you fit in.

    crises or had substance issues. As a child, you couldn’t understand if you had
    any part in these problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    could become egotistical, but this is because you want to ignore your Neptune.
    It’s painful to dig in and look at the hurt that lies opposite your Sun.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Neptune represents your childhood, and it may feel murky or shaky, as though
    nothing is real. You want reality, so you focus on the ego, but this can make
    you too brash, over-confident, aggressive, or self-centered. Keep in mind that
    these are simply defense mechanisms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you may swing back and forth between the pull of the Sun and
    of Neptune. You sometimes feel too sensitive, and other times you feel that you
    must try to grow up and enforce your will.

    so that you can stop struggling against yourself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from your fears. Work through your childhood trauma and then integrate the lessons
    you’ve learned into your outer personality.

    disorientation continues to cause problems in your adult life.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    too far. You may live in your own fantasies, leaving you vulnerable to people
    who see you as easy pickings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much of this stems from your issues with your father. His distance, whether
    it was emotional or physical, left you with a hole instead of a strong sense of
    self.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you might even idealize your father now. You gloss over the difficult
    times and prefer to see him as someone wonderful, whether this is true or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Sun square Neptune, you need to be very careful of using escapist behavior.
    When reality is too hard to deal with, you tend to run away, but nothing ever
    lives up to your fantasies completely.

    world because you feel that you have no power in reality, but this isn’t true.
  prefs: []

    it at first. Eventually, you will find that the truthful reality is much better
    than your idealistic versions of the world.
  prefs: []

- en: With Sun square Neptune, you can learn to see beauty and chaos. You will figure
    out how to harness the energy of the Universe to make things happen for you and
    take back your power instead of struggling with it, but this simply takes work
    and time.
