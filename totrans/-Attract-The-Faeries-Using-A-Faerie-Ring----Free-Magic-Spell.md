# ~Attract The Faeries Using A Faerie Ring~

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This summoning spell should be done at noon or early morn like at 12:00AM when the veil to the Faeries are at it's thin. If you don't have a Faerie ring in your yard I would suggest going into the woods, forest, field of grass, or greenlands Faerie rings appear at places where there are no human activity don't just do the spell when you find the ring ask politely if it's ok to be in their presence and that you mean them no harm. I did this and I saw white whisps flying pass the trees and near me so good luck!

This will not summon a fairy, and if you believe in fairy rings, stepping in one will anger the fairys which would result in you getting jinxed by the fairys.

For anyone curious, the three words at the end are Latin and they mean: I come, I call, I see. Also, salt is used as a protection from fairies because fairies can't stand salt. Sprinkling salt on the ring will not only anger the fairies but also kill the mushrooms that border the fairy ring. If you are lucky enough to find a fairy ring, all that you need to do is sit near it at dawn/dusk to see a fairy. There are many different stories about what happens when you step inside a fairy ring but none of them end well. (or they were barely able to regain their wits long enough to escape)
