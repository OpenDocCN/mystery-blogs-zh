# To Summon Help from the-Elements

  Rated 5/5 Stars

This is only one way to summon help from the Elements. You use representations of each Element and address the spirits of each element in turn to seek their assistance. When you have finished your task each element is then honoured by returning it to the earth.

 ## Casting Instructions for 'To Summon Help from the-Elements'

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   White candle (to represent Fire)

*   Small bowl of salt or sand (to represent Earth)

*   Small bowl of water

*   Incense such as bergamot (to represent Air)

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   White candle (to represent Fire)

*   Small bowl of salt or sand (to represent Earth)

*   Small bowl of water

*   Incense such as bergamot (to represent Air)

 Light the incense and the candle. Bear in mind as you do so at this stage that you are making use of the Elements of Fire and Air. Call upon the power of these Elements. Ask for their help in the work you are about to do.

Use your own words preferably but do keep it simple. You might say for Fire something like: "I request your presence, Oh Spirit of Fire I ask for your help, your power I require". For Air your words might be: "Come to me now, Oh Spirit of Air I pray above all for a mind that is clear" Lift the bowl of salt and likewise invoke the powers of the Earth Element. Say perhaps: "Approach now I pray, spirit of Earth Help I do need, and prove now my worth". Do the same with the water and say: "Come to me now, Oh, Spirit of Water My feelings are clear your strength is now sought for."

When you have finished, sprinkle the salt or sand on the earth, pour the water onto the earth, bury the ashes of the incense and snuff out the candle. This is not a spell as such, but more preparation for magical working. Whereas you can cast a circle within which to carry out your more important workings this allows you to set up a sacred space very quickly.
