- en: If you believe that a spell has been cast against you, place a large black candle
    in a cauldron (or a large black bowl). The candle must be tall enough to extend
    a few inched above the cauldron's rim. Affix the candle to the bottom of the cauldron
    with warmed beeswax or the drippings of another black candle so that it will not
    tip over.

- en: Fill the cauldron to the rim with fresh water,without wetting the candle's wick.
    An inch or two of the candle should remain above the water. Deep breathe, meditate,
    clear your mind, and light the candle. Visualize the suspected spell's power as
    residing within the candle's flame. Sit in quiet contemplation of the candle and
    visualize the power flowing and growing with the candle's flame (yes the power
    against you). As the candle burns down, its flame will eventually sputter and
    go out as it contacts the water. As soon as the flame has been extinguished by
    the water, the spell will be dispersed.

    It is done.
