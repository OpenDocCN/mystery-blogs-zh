# Proof Shape Shifting Is 100% Possible.

We get called fake a LOT, so, haters, listen up!

 ## Casting Instructions for 'Proof Shape Shifting Is 100% Possible.'

**You will need the following items for this spell:****You will need the following items for this spell:** First of all, all species are related, we have fish genes in our bodies and in our legs, with merfolk not being a found species yet, no, their not really astral or spirits. Yes we can turn it back into a tail, by turning back on though genes.  Now, the native americans can shape shift... don't try to say they were astrally shifting, physical, you can't just call them fake. Google or search "mermaid shifting". I hate when someone on here says that magic can't change our appearance, and they say that on a page of shape shifting. Shape shift and magic(k) are 100% different. This is not to be rude, it's to educate. Shape shifters don't need a human telling us what and isn't possible, again, no offence. Humans only use a small percentage of their brain, if one unlocks another part of their brain, they could unlock shape shifting, I'm using merfolk as an example, and it's not like in h2o and thoughs shows where you touch water and get a tail, then you get to dry off and get legs again, it could take and hour... it could take a week, to get legs again.

I believe you actually everyone has a different mythical creature there are sirens, werewolves, vampire, sorcerer or sorceress and last there is a shapeshifter you know that all this stuff can be proven if people can unlock a different part of their brain no one else has.

The person who posted this spell demonstrates absolutely no knowledge of physiology of vertebrates, which alone should clue anyone in to the idea that the above is fake, posted by someone either trying to be funny, playing tricks, or just having fun. Transformation is not possible. You are human and will remain human.

I vote that its possible(cause it is)

Where do I begin with this nonsense? The description, anyone who explains facts to you are not being haters. When we explain what Real Magik is, how it works, and what is and is not possible, we are not ''hater'' we are stating facts. We know how confusing The Craft can be, and wish to help. Lies like this ''spell'' does not help anyone.

The first sentence of the ''spell'': what evidence do you have to prove your opinion? Is this like the Carl Sagan quote about us being star stuff? Where, yes, we have the same molecules and genetics that other species have? Cakes use butter, sugar, eggs and flour, but so do cookies. It is how you use these ingredients that determines if you make a cake or cookies. DNA is the same way.

Claiming meremaids are physical and absolutely not astral or spirits. That is a blatant lie. Plenty of witches work with these spirits. I have seen them while traveling the astral. The sea is vast and there is a slim chance they live in the depths, but they **are** astral beings and spirits. Research sea witchcraft, they work with water spirits including mermaids.

Physical transformation is not real. There are otherkins and therians which are physically real, however, they do not physically transform. They are spirits in the wrong physical vessel. A wolf spirit in a human body, or a vampire in a physical body. They cannot physically transform into what their spirit is. Claiming Native Americans can shapeshift is a racist stereotype and not a fact. It is rooted in the mysticism of their culture by white society and the result of a sacred ceremony by one indigenous culture. Indigenous peoples are not a monolith, just because one tribe believes the final test of a shaman is to be taught shapeshifting, does not mean every native person can shapeshift. Twilight perpetuated this stereotype and the Quileute people have been trying to educate people against it ever since.

I goggled ''mermaid shifting'' like you asked. The top three links is a youtube video, which I do not consider ''evidence.'' She did provide links in the description and warn against not believing everything you hear online which won her some brownie points. She was also describing how to reality shift, which is real and is possible. She spoke about a TikTok, which is a giant red flag for me. She did insinuate your physical vanishes when you mentally shift, which does not happen. However, she spoke about dressing like a mermaid and not physically transforming, lucid dreaming, and other transformations not on the physical plane, which are all ways to transform. You cannot will your legs to become a tail, but you can buy a mermaid tail to wear. The next link on Google was Wattpad, which is not credible, followed by an Etsy shop and finally Pinterest. None of these are credible evidence.

All things are Magik. Magik is a neutral energy that brings change. You could argue technology is Magik because the energy of change (Magik) influenced/inspired someone to invent something. They wanted to fly, they manifested flight into their reality by inventing a plane. Magik is everywhere and in every thing. Magik was science before we knew what science was. The video about mermaids spoke of wearing a mermaid tail to ''become'' a mermaid. That can count as Magik. You can create a ritual and wear the tail. You are still physically human, but you can achieve goals if you look at them another way.

I love how you called me and people like me ''haters'' in the description, only to get to the spell where you say you hate people trying to educate, followed by claiming you do not mean to be rude, and concluding with insulting people who try to educate. But you ended that sentence with ''no offense'' so clearly you are off the hook. You can slander anyone with anything, but end your statement with ''no offense'' and be a-okay. For the record, I have a goal of commenting on all the sites spells to try and help new members sort through fact and fiction. Fake spells are quicker to get through so I began there. As for others, someone comments ''I'm a mermaid thanks to this spell'' and those who know the spell is fake want to stop the spread of misinformation. They are not haters, they are worried one persons lies will harm others. One bad apple spoils the bunch.

Humans **do not** only use a small percentage of their brain. This is a myth. We use 100% of our brain. Some is for memory, thinking, walking, eating, ensuring your lungs are working without you actively thinking ''breath.'' It is all used. There are plenty of studies debunking this and yet people who wish to sell lies about shapeshifting and special powers love to use this famous myth to sound credible. It has been disproven. Stop perpetuating it.

You **cannot** physically shapeshift, no matter how much you believe. H2O was a tv show for tween girls. It was not a documentary. It does not matter if you go ''it won't be like that, it'll take a week'' it will not happen. Never in a million years will humans go ''bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, I'll be a mermaid too'' and then you physically transform into one. It is complete nonsense. It defies all natural laws. We have a plethora of evidence debunking all of your lies and yet, none of it will register because ''I believe'' and then I am handed a link to a YouTube video by WakeUpSheeple123 and am told I am the liar. There are astral mermaids. You can work with mermaid spirits. You can dress like a mermaid. You can call on their energy to help in your craft. You can mentally and astrally shift into mermaids. Physically is 100% fake and will never work. Period.

I 100% agree with all of you.

uhhhh, no. Theres no such thing as ''unlocking'' the full potential of the brain. You dont show understanding of much science either (i mean like we are all just people on the internet so of course its not like required to have scientific knowledge and lots of research to theorize) You are basically saying that humans are stupider than us, and thats not true. Ive met a lot of stupid people who are shifters, and ive met many smart people who are human. I think you might be talking more of ignorance than anything. Many people choose to be ignorant to certain things, but that doesnt mean that they are incapable of preforming these sorts of things. Ive seen plenty of stories of people shifting into an animal at a very young age, or at least being very animal-like at a young age. You do have a point for some things (such as the H2O, or that magic and physical shifting is different.) but overall everything else is wrong. I mean like, nobody should expect for random internet people to have proficient understanding of their topic, because I do see that you had a point with this post.

This is dumber than 7 year old me believing that if I believe charge enough I could manifest Doritos with my mind

I put hard not charge*** The autocorrect is driving me crazy.

That is funny, but I respect it more than this article. I saw Practical Magic around that age and I spent a lot of time trying to start candles by blowing on them. My parents encouraged me to keep trying until I realized it could not be done. When I asked them why they did not tell me it was impossible, they said it was not doing any harm, I was going to gain a valuable lesson on my own, and they liked that I was finally doing *some* form of meditation. Sometimes you need to learn for yourself. We all make mistakes. You learn, you apply the lesson, you move on. It is when we dwell and refuse to admit fault we suffer.

A saying has just now spawned into my mind, thanks to the discussion of the previous few posts and an ADD interlude;

''If you warn a child that fire is hot, but they place their hand in it anyways- The lesson that results is on them. If you see a child reaching for fire and say nothing, the fault is on you.'' This is the core basis for why those like us work so hard to advise on false information.
