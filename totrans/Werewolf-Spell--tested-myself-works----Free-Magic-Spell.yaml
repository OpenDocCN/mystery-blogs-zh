    it DOES work. It can be done either at day or night and you MUST believe in the
    spell in order for it to work. This spell will allow you to physically shift into
    a werewolf and back as you please.

- en: this spell does not work, doesn't matter if you claim it does, real magick doesn't
    contradict nature, and since humans cannot transform [sorry to burst your bubble

- en: Regarding the question marks, the site does that sometimes [especially if you
    type in a different language] two, we are trying to educate people on real magick
    so they don't waste time/energy on fake spells, get discouraged and leave the
    path. If you want to play make believe, fine, but not on this site since it's
    for real pagans to discuss real paganism, not nonsense

    physical form; breaking natural laws isn't possible. Werewolves also aren't real,
    and so you cannot become a werewolf.

- en: you guys it legit says for this to work you need to believe in this spell!!!
    how can it be fake if you dont believe
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don't believe everything you read. People can lie very easily online. Magick
    is an energy found in nature. On the physical plane [the one we live on] it's
    ruled by nature and cannot contradict it. Werewolves are astral beings [from a
    different plane of existence] they don't exist on the physical plane. Magick on
    the physical plane effects the energy around us to attract/repel a desired change
    in our lives. If it's possible naturally, it's possible, if it contradicts nature,
    it's impossible. No amount of believe will change that. [try the spell yourself
    to see] You can work with werewolves similar to deities, Dragons, or spirits [among
    others] you can call on their symbolism to influence your spiritual path, you
    can look into spirit animals and spirit totems [though I would caution your on
    it being borderline cultural appropriation] You can even dress like a werewolf
    if you desire [there is also people known as otherkin, they're humans but they
    have an animal spirit. physically, they're human, it doesn't give them shapeshifting
    powers, they just have a spiritual connection] Unfortunately physically transforming
    into a werewolf isn't possible. Take care. All the best on your path.
