# Anthropomorphic Animal Spell

To become an anthropomorphic animal and turn back and forth at will. Don't change in public.

**You will need the following items for this spell:**

*   A bit of fur or feathers from your animal, or its domestic/common counterpart

*   Red candle, brown candle, white candle, black candle, and silver candle

*   Knife

*   Picture or drawing (doesn't have to be by you) of your new form

*   New moon

*   Silver pen or marker

*   Nighttime

*   Outside with lots of space

## Casting Instructions for 'Anthropomorphic Animal Spell'

Take the candles and set them up like this: Put the silver candle closest to you, and on the left and right of it place the white candle and black candle, respectively, and move them up a bit so it makes a V. Put the red candle to the far left of the silver candle, and the brown to the far right, so it makes an M. Sit a bit away from it, about a foot or two, so you don't get burned.
Hold the picture. Be sure you want to do this. You'll need to pay attention to it; you can't just stop shifting. Now focus on every feature of it. Imagine the changes appearing on you. Imagine being this anthropomorphic animal. Keep focusing until you are sure. It's good if you feel, either beforehand or as you concentrate, that you ARE this anthro. That it is you, and you are it.
Now, light the red candle and chant:

''Unlock the gates to my soul
Enter my body and make me whole''

Light the brown candle and chant:

''The beast inside stands tall
Stronger than stone to never fall''

Light the white candle and chant:

''Cleanse me and prepare me
Two souls to forever be
An anthro (animal) resides within me
To take shape when I set it free''

Light the black candle and chant:

''Drain all negativity
Fill me with positivity
To welcome graciously
The (animal) deep within me''

Finally, light the silver candle and chant:

''When I wish it, they come free
And this anthro (animal) becomes me
I take control of their body
And welcome the beautiful energy
My spirit is here, I welcome thee
Wonderful animal energy
From human to anthro to back I shall transform
Perfectly comfortable in either form
This is my will, so mote it be!''

Now focus on the energy of you melding with the anthro's energy. Imagine changing rapidly, fur or feathers growing in as you change to match the picture, then shifting back to human. Imagine orbs or pools of energy filling you, and as they do, you turn into the anthro wherever they touch. Concentrate on this for a while, then carve pentagrams into the candles in the same order you lit them, then cut your finger and drip your blood onto the candles in the same order. Now take the silver pen and draw a pentagram on the back of the picture, before dividing it into approximate fifths, as equal as you can get. Burn a piece on each candle, then snuff them out with the ashes.

has anyone tested this? Also just to check, this alows you to turn back and forth at will (human, to anthro, and back) like a were-animal right? Exmp: only one ritual.

It's fake. If you're interested in something like this, look into lucid dreaming and astral shifting.

You cannot physically transform into anything.
