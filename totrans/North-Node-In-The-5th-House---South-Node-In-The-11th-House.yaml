    purpose through creative self-expression. This placement suggests that you have
    a natural talent for the arts, and it’s important for you to explore your creative

    want to move away from working with groups or changing yourself to fit a group.

    they are points in your natal chart that mark where the moon’s orbit crosses the
    ecliptic (the apparent path the sun takes around the Earth). They’re always directly
    opposite each other in the chart.

    of your life path and purpose. It is also known as the Dragon’s Head and is the
    opposite point of the South Node, which represents your past life experiences
    and habits.

- en: The North Node is often considered your “true north” or life path. It’s like
    a cosmic pointer showing you where you can find personal growth, fulfillment,
    and development in this lifetime. It outlines the qualities, situations, and experiences
    you should focus on to evolve as a person. It’s not about instant comfort; in
    fact, the themes of your North Node may initially feel unfamiliar or challenging.
    But that’s the point—growth usually happens at the edge of your comfort zone.

    lives, if you believe in that, or simply the traits and tendencies you’re most
    comfortable with. It’s the “been there, done that” part of your chart. While the
    South Node qualities can be strengths, they can also be crutches if you lean on
    them too much. The South Node is often seen as what you’re moving away from in
    this lifetime, in order to achieve the growth outlined by your North Node.

    seeing a map of where you’re coming from and where you’re headed. The goal is
    not to completely abandon your South Node traits but to integrate them in a balanced
    way as you strive towards your North Node’s mission. It’s like having a built-in
    yin and yang in your astrological profile, guiding you towards a more balanced

    you are meant to express yourself through some form of art or self-expression.
    Whether it’s painting, writing, or performing, find a way to tap into your creative
    energy and share it with the world. It’s important not to stifle your creativity

    the point is to engage in activities that let your spirit soar and your self-expression
    flow. This can be a private journal, a hobby you pick up, or even a more public
    display of your talents. So while classical piano, working only within the structures
    others set, might not be moving towards your North Node, composing random songs
